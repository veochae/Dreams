1,Dreams,Pool Cleaner vs Zombies,"Last night’s dream was trying to unclog a suburban swimming pool while fighting off zombies. For some reason the pool fed into a moat that ran around the entire property, and zombies were in it. Turned out they didn’t like being hosed though and kept their distance. By the time I fought my way from the front yard to the backyard pool the lawn was completely flooded with dirty water. It became a pretty standard “how do we fix the pool?” dream after that, the zombies didn’t come into it again. I’m not a pool cleaner and don’t have one irl.",2024-05-12 19:47:22
2,Dreams,Magic stores ?,"I always visit this **** mall that kinda looks like little old timey stores and 1 of the shops is a magic Asian / International market where all the foods I have ever wanted to try are, another is a thrift store that has the most amazing vintage- stuff I have never seen but it looks so real???? Another is a block buster type thing but instead I checkout and view my own memories on DVDS or VCR tapes?? 

I probably go to the **** mall at least once or twice a week. It’s always the same but sometimes back doors in the stores appear that bring me to another part of the town I don’t get to visit as frequently. 

Theres 3-4 more stores in the lot I haven’t gotten to explore yet. Sometimes Im lucid and able to control stuff other times I am simply aware but unable to control the story line or my actions. Idk anyone have something similar?",2024-05-12 19:39:13
3,Dreams,Dreamed of a Cheetah,"I had a dream where I was looking put into my back yard.  We have a deck in real life, and alot of feral cats, too.  In my dream, the deck was covered in cats and kittens, and in the middle, was a giant cheetah.  I called my parants over and we were midly perplexed at the concpet of a giant cheetah.",2024-05-12 19:29:35
4,Dreams,GTA ,"I dreamt that I or someone else was playing GTA 6, it was nothing like the GTA 6 being advertised right now but my brain told me it was GTA 6 (maybe it was GTA 7?) Anyway, the game was set in Washington D.C and lots and I mean LOTS of fun features like shaking hands with the president, the crude humour knew no bounds and the main protagonist was either Irish or English I don't know which was which. I think my favourite part of this dream was a grand mountain range with lakes it actually would've been fun and beautiful to explore. 

  
I thought this would be cool to share.",2024-05-12 19:15:31
5,Dreams,I dreamed I was in Mexico and I’ve never been there it was crazy ,"Dreamt I was driving through Mexico, never been there, and i ended up in a place called Adduct. A dusty town with lots of tourists and lovely little shops. I was travelling on my own but met a lovely couple who happily let me walk through the town with them. 


Just had to get it off my chest. This was days ago and it’s still in my brain. Wonder what it means. I’ve not even seen Mexico on the tv recently. Not to mention the word Adduct. ",2024-05-12 18:59:23
6,Dreams,Dream Highlights,"I've been tired all morning, after eating too much avocado last night.

In the first dream, I was in my bedroom. I was falling asleep. The melatonin in my eyes was noticeable, even in my dreams. I was talking outload to my man, while looking up at my edward cullen poster.

I could feel his energy in the room, watching me. I climbed up onto the bunk bed, seeing moths nip at one of the banisters. Spanish rice, scarlet red in color was on the comforter. It was almost like I was hovering; as I looked down onto both beds. I used to cling onto the top bedframe that made it feel like I was hovering. I noticed two of my fleece blankets. One is my hannah montana blanket, which my mom gave me to sleep with months ago. Another was cream, with teal blue. Looks like the breaking dawn part 2 blanket that I never got to use. That was also on the top bunk in real life. A small bundle of stuff was placed on the bottom bunk bed, so I couldn't lay there without pushing it away. Some of it was paper. Scrap booking paper. Which is where my twilight themed ones from the craftstore were, but my mom threw away last summer. I laid back and slept, grabbing both fleece blankets at one point.

After waking up, I made a mental note to write it down. I hadn't got much sleep up until then. It was still too early to be awake. I fell back asleep, some more. Then had this dream. I was in a room with my family, quarters in my hand. I went for the machines behind the couch. Putting them into a tattoo vending machine, I saw the theme was anti-love. The left side of the machine was somehow important, this or the next machine. I put the quarters also in the right end slot, retrieving food for my family. My dad's abusive 'family' members were there as well, making me motivated to take up the resources available to us. A spoon got my attention because it had one of my partner's favorite group names on it. I think I tried to take a picture of it.

My bookbag from school was with me, holding my binder full of papers. I took it out to make room for the food and things I was taking. Plastic saran wrap food got my attention, as I grabbed it and put it in the bag. I remember seeing coffee cake wrapped in it; entenmanns looking, but nothing like that. Not dry, for one. It was crunchy at the top and moist, like a homemade cake. There was also a eaten chicken leg, with dark bourbon skin hanging off it. I found more chicken, taking it with me. They were fried though/natural. Whatever drinks and food I took after, hopefully didn't get stolen by the other family. I laid down on the couch with my mom, waking up in a similar sleeping position. My dad was across the room with a two liter of soda, pantless. I think I saw a drink spilled; pineapple, before I laid down. Got my hand wet, probably. I woke up, arms crossed under my jaw/collar, in a fetal position. My head ached from the angle it was in, in the dream. My eyelashes stuck together within the dream, soaked with tears. And pus, even. I could feel my eyes within my dream.",2024-05-12 18:49:43
7,Dreams,Dream City,"I've had re occuring dreams in the past of an empty city and in that city other bits like a fun fair, theme park, hotel, long stretching roads.

Now these places are usually empty and i'm only with select people or on my own. I want to explore these dreams again but apparently big empty areas represent loneliness which sucks. Now I'm not feeling lonely at the minute so unfortunetly I wont be getting these dreams. But my **** brain keeps putting me in dark areas and getting killed so I don't think my brains completely right just yet ****",2024-05-12 18:33:35
8,Dreams,Absolutely Bizarre Sex Dreams,"I sometimes have these dreams where I’m about to have **** with someone but their **** always looks grotesque. The most recent one, the **** was covered in what I can only describe as furry black mold… it also smelled terrible. It repulsed me but I was trying to power through. Im also straight, but the very few “bi-curious” dreams I’ve had, the women genitalia was the same way. I was repulsed but tried to power through each time because I was feeling **** and wanted a release (****). Does anyone have any idea what these dreams could mean?

9,Dreams,How do I deal with my spiritual enemies?,"They typically visit me or show up in my sleep/dreams. Just when I am half sleep half woke that is when they start getting active and it's always something they end up saying or doing to scare me or conjure up feelings of fear/anxiety. They're also stubborn about maintaining control/having/keeping the upper hand ,always. Sometimes as I am half sleep half woke they conjure up visions of things in my minds eye to startle me/scare me. They have already decided which way this is going to go..... their way or no way. They get what they want. How do I fight them back spiritually? I've tried meditating but the visions I recieve during meditation are typically negative like I'll recieve a vision of people either laughing at me, pointing at me in a ""ha-ha"" type of way. Embarrassing dream themes ectopic. This has been going on for years and has not stopped. Before you tell me to pray, I've prayed, I've done lots of things and the problem still persists. I've also had other strange phenomenons in my life that if I told you about them it would seem like something out of a movie, unbelievable situations that has been keeping me in constant fear. It's been a long time that I've been trapped in this vibration of fear. I also get really hyper-realistic dreams of me drowning and it feels so real when I wake up it just does not feel like a dream. I've tried many things, positive thinking all types of stuff ,increasing my vibrations ect.",2024-05-12 18:25:54
10,Dreams,I had a dream that ended in one of my worst fears.,"I don't recall what exactly happened during the beginning of it. But as I approached the end of it, I was walking down an alleyway, and suddenly blackness like just pure void started surrounding me, and before you know it, I was surrounded in basically infinite nothingness. At least in space there are like bright white dots where stars are, **nope**, when I say infinite nothingness I mean **infinite nothingness**. Maybe it's like a subconscious fear I have, but one of my worst fears, is that when I die, somehow our soul or consciousness or whatever will just be floating around existing in an infinite void alone, no distant stars, no planets, no heaven, no ****, just nothing for all eternity. But during the end of the dream, I became lucid and realized this is a dream, and just wanted to be back home, and boom I was back home, after walking for a little longer in that ""seemingly"" infinite void. Then I had some trouble walking once I was at home, like my dream self could walk, but like walking like a zombie probably would, it's like I'm in my body for the 1st time, then I woke up.",2024-05-12 18:24:23
11,Dreams,“Zooming out” of dreams?,"Okay, so I’m not sure if this happens to anyone else, but I have a lot of vivid, random dreams where I’m not exactly lucid but also definitely aware???

The way it happens is this. I’ll be in a particularly dramatic part of the dream, experiencing whatever is going on, and then suddenly, it pulls back. Time stops for a second, and I’m suddenly in a theater watching everything like a movie before it puts me back into the actual dream scenario.

I guess it’s my mind’s way of telling me not to flip out because none of it is real? I’ve just never really heard other people experience it this way. And I don’t end up lucid dreaming either. At least, I don’t think. I can control my own actions, but I can’t control anything else going on.

I guess I’m just wondering if anyone else has a sort of “zoom out” to disconnect them from what’s happening.",2024-05-12 17:58:20
12,Dreams,Unnervingly Satisfying dream,"I was in some local store when suddenly a group of mugers ambushed me. There were 4 of them. I don't remember how but after a fight I had managed to **** 3 of them. The last guy tried to put me in a chokehold but i managed to free myself. While he was distracted I grab his head and started smashing his face against a metal shelf over and over again. Watching his face slowly because unrecognisable. It felt extremely satisfying seeing this mans head turn into a mushy red paste.

This was the first and only dream where I've felt like this... weird.",2024-05-12 17:58:20
13,Dreams,I dreamt that my bf got hurt,"I had a nightmare this morning that my boyfriend got hurt, I remember the super anxious feeling I got when I woke up and I almost called him but I just went back to sleep. He texts me this afternoon that he fell while hiking and he’s out of the country right now and he got super hurt (sprained or broke not sure yet) and I’m just mind boggled right now. I swear on everything I know that I had this dream this morning and i haven’t had such an intense feeling in a while (I don’t really get nightmares though). Idk I just wanted to share my experience.",2024-05-12 17:55:55
14,Dreams,I had this strange dream about me driving and not being able to open my eyes. What does this mean?,"The other night i was having some trouble sleeping. I’ve been working a lot so suddenly and while i’m tired, i’m left tossing and turning. I finally fell asleep and immediately started dreaming. I was driving my car at night. It was late at night and I was really tired. I couldn’t keep my eyes open though. I would close my eyes, then try to hard to keep them open because, well i was driving! I was able to pull over on the side of the road and turn on my hazards without hitting anyone. I was really scared and managed to get my one eye open for like a minute to call 911 because something was wrong with me. I would sit there with my finger pulling open my eye, but I couldn’t see anything. It was every time, i would pull open my eye, and only see for half a second. I woke up on my side, facing the wall, so i know it wasn’t any kind of sleep paralysis. I felt really awake in the dream, and actually thought I was truly living this. I’m not exactly sure what this means. I’ve never had a dream like this before. I’ve had livid dreams, but nothing like this. If anyone has any ideas about what could have been happening, i’d greatly appreciate it. it just really freaked me out. ",2024-05-12 17:54:57

18,Dreams,I've been having very weird dreams this year,"Yeah, so, I thought of sharing them, just for fun and see what people can figure out about them. I'm going in no particular order:

Dream One: I was in a classroom. The teacher scold all of us because we had to write an essay, but apperently all of us did a poor job. She then took us to secret hallway in the class that went to what seemed to be the interior of a pyramid with hieroglyphs and the like. She told us to decypher them and redo the work. So, I did just that. Turns out the hieroglyphs were left by Isabel II (The one from United Kingdom that died not that long ago, not the Spaniard one) but before I could do anything about, the royal guard quick us out of the place. Then two soldiers had this exchange:

* Who were this people?
* I don't know, she had many enemies.



Dream Two: This one was in first person, like a horror movie. Aliens with the shape of humanoid lobsters (Aliens are going to be a recurring theme, by the way) killed every in the neighboohood because, apparently, weaving your hand at them was very offensive.

Dream Three: I was on a gym with ""my family"". Not my real family though. I had a dad (I'm a half-orphan and never met the guy) and that man didn't even look like the pictures of my dad I've seen, I had a sister (I'm an only child) and the mom in the dream wasn't my real world mom. Anyway, there was a second-hand market of things families didn't need/want anymore. However, there were one suitcase in each table that didn't belong to anyone. Upon opening them, turns out there were white balloons inside... Except they weren't balloons at at, but alien parasyite that began to attach to people skins and couldn't be removed (well, without losing part of your body, it was pretty gory, especially considering I have a phobia of blood). The people couldn't leave the gym because the mayor locked us in. In a change of scene (Very cinematic, to be honest) I see the mayor speaking with a clown which limbs were already the size of an adult. (And before you ask me, no, I haven't watch Clowns from outter space, IT or anything with clowns recently).

Dream Four: I dreamed I watched a Youtube review of Insidious 6 by Angry Joe. After doing so, I left my house and found a man disguised as a demon trying to sneak in a garden. I followed him (Which is totally out of character for me, to be honest) and turns out he was a human GPS named Pepe, used to track lost cats and dogs with a satellite.

Dream Five: This time I was in a mall in which the owners of the shops spend their nights, in a secret sociaty kind of way. However, they were all hidding from the movie theater owner, because she follow them insulting them because nobody ever went to see the movies.

Dream Six: I was a kid in a library. Everything was pitch black and a giant animatronic (its hand was already as big as me) with my adult face grabbed me and rip my clothes. Thankfully, I woke up at that point, but it was still very distubing.

And that would be it. For now at least. I know it's a long post but I didn't want to do one for each dream.",2024-05-12 17:23:08
19,Dreams,Saw myself winning the lottery,The way to describe it was it felt like energy going into the ticket I was holding. It didn’t show any numbers but there was constant energy channeling into the ticket. What does this mean? And I saw dragons in the clouds a couple months back. Does anyone know how to interpret this?,2024-05-12 17:21:21
20,Dreams,Teeth falling out? ,"So last night I had a weird dream hoping you guys can help me interpret it. So in the dream I touched one of my teeth and it feels out of my mouth. It was on the bottom right side but the tooth was also really big, much bigger than my teeth actually are. ",2024-05-12 17:19:01

The dream started with me walking in a feild for what felt like an eternity, after a while I see an old man wearing grey robes edged in ivory white standing about 100 yards away. He was staring at the ground muttering unintelligibly, I approached him slowly as I got within 50 yards he looked up at me eyes glowing gold and pointed at me as soon as he did a bolt of lightning came from a clear sky and struck him, I woke with a start and now can't get his face out of my mind.",2024-05-12 17:07:14
22,Dreams,What does the dream mean? Pulling out my younger family friend’s tooth,"I was in my kitchen and my 7yo family friend is sitting on the counter. She shows me her wobbly baby tooth and wants me to pull it out. I feel uncomfortable pulling the tooth but she feels no pain at all. It comes out fine and then I start to feel my own missing tooth spot as if I lost the tooth.

Does this dream mean anything? I don’t think about teeth often…",2024-05-12 16:54:59

25,Dreams,decapitating someone's head,"I just woke up from a dream where I saw 3 or 4 people eating and I went up to then and decided to take the head of a face I don't recognize irl. I took his head of and a minute later someone I'm close with came to the scene and continued to do what I had started. We crushed the head so much that it became like a soup and that someone I know took a bite out of it while I check if there's someone watching. Soon enough we were 3 people in that dream, there was someone who's just looking at us in all black face unrecognizable and then, I can see someone walking outside (someone I know irl) about to buy food for herself and the dream ended there. 

What does this dream means? Does dreams really have to mean something or is this just about my position in sleeping or somethin'? I'm really freaked out rn. ",2024-05-12 16:32:14
26,Dreams,Dream about a baby,"When I dream. It is like real life, every single time. I genuinely think I could write movies and books about my dreams because of how long and detailed they are. I have a few recurring dreams but recently I keep on having this particular one. I dream that I am pregnant, give birth and spend a few years with my child. The child is always the same. A beautiful baby boy with brown hair beautiful brown eyes the most precious smile and laugh and is so warm and loving. When I look at him, holding him he has this beautiful yellow glow around him and I feel complete. It’s always the same but when I wake up I am actually deviated. I feel as though, I’m missing a piece of myself. It sounds **** but I sometimes cry, Like I’m grieving a lost loved one. It probably means nothing but I want to know if anyone else experiences the same thing or something similar. You dream about something you don’t have, yet have a deep connection to. This child doesn’t even exist yet but I miss him. I am 22 and to be honest don’t really like children or like the idea of having kids especially at this point in my life. ",2024-05-12 16:31:22
27,Dreams,So whats up with my my ex crush popping up in my dreams lately ,"It’s has been 11 years since I last saw them and idk anything them at all or could even care less 
but so some odd reason they have keep poping up in my dreams lately 
Especially in past few months 
my recent one was about this morning 

Dream starts here:
I was in my dream and someone random came up to a group of my friends and I and said that TikTok had came out with this new filter that can read your mind and can tell about your past, love interest, etc who did you  wrong in the past etc 

And does this by scanning your picture etc and this supposed to be 
Like whole brain scan to reveal your deepest secrets
Right 

So in my dream when it’s was my turn  to use the TikTok filter

 I kind of had an of idea who would pop up as my love interest/ list of all the people that I’ve ever had crush on but when the  filter revealed its results 
It only had one name and it was his name I flipped out in my dream and starting say this ridiculous I don’t have feelings for him his faint memory of my past 

Mind you I have feelings for someone else right now and this crush of minds I have no interaction with what so ever we don’t even share the same circle etc 

I just want to know why has been appearing my dreams lately it weird

28,Dreams,Psychic dreams anyone?,"So I’ve had about 3 dreams that totally ended up happening. I know it all has to do with I was observing something with my subconscious and didn’t realize it. It was already going to happen but I still think it’s cool.
      In high school I dreamt my boyfriend cheated on me. They were making out in what looked like car seat. A couple days later he went on his senior trip. ( an 8 hour bus ride there) When they got back 3 days later I heard they “hooked up” on the way down and back yuck. I guess I knew already. The others weren’t very exciting ether my car breaking down that I barely remember, it’s like a couple blips. And another one I can’t remember really at all just a sliver, a flash. I think it had something to do with my mom and a fight. Sorry for forgetting. Anyway now when I have a cheating dream or dying dream I really trip out.

30,Dreams,My Forever Person - My Dream,"I woke up from a dream that left a bittersweet taste — the dream sweet and the reality bitter.
The dream, as well as I'm able to remember, goes like this:

A friend asks me how my girlfriend is and instinctively, I say she's well. Once I answer, I start thinking about her. In reality, it has been so long since I've felt anything for anyone or been with anyone that the idea of having a girlfriend seemed extremely strange, even in my dream and I'm aware of it at this point. I try to ""remember"" her face and voice. Vague concepts of the two appear, but nothing concrete. Even her name feels vague. I open my phone to check her name. After some digging around, I see that I've saved her name as ""firstly love"". I have no idea why I would save her contact that way, yet, I don't feel it's weird. It gives me a sense of familiarity, with a sprinkle of giddiness. I see that our last conversation was on the previous day. No messages or calls since then.

I shut my phone and go out. I cannot make out the place and it seems like some more time has passed, and I'm talking to my friend from the beginning of the dream. I feel like I'm experiencing this part in the first- and third-person at the same time. I get to know that she's a few years younger to me and her name materialises, which at this point, I cannot remember anymore, except that it's a beautiful name. Her face materialises next. She's very pretty, and she has this soothing expression on her face that seems to be her resting face.
I remember that we still haven't talked since the previous day. As I am in reality, I feel that it makes no sense to wait for anyone to text you first when you can do it yourself if you really wanted to talk. So, I open my phone and send her a text asking if everything was okay. At the same time, I also feel a bit worried because it's not like her to not text me, though I know that like me, somedays, things become too hectic to remember to text. 

Another piece of memory comes back. We have not let many know about us. As I think of this, I open my Instagram to see if she has sent me anything to watch. She's always loved sending me random videos that she likes. I love them too. As I open the app, I see that she has posted an open-for-all-followers story. I open it and I freeze. It's me. She has posted me over multiple stories. It's from when we had gone to the beach. She had taken those photos, in which, I'm looking at her with a smile. I have rarely seen myself looking so happy. She's even posted a video of me from a few years back, before we had gotten together. I don't know how she even managed to get it. The last story is a photo of our hands, holding each other. The text on it reads, ""my forever person ❣️""... 

""My forever person"". I keep re-reading this phrase many times, each time feeling more and more happy. All of my worries about her not texting me, all of my stress from my work, everything melts away. I feel so light and blissful. I call her and ask where she is. We meet some time later. But I'm caught off-guard when I see her. She's not the same person I remembered earlier in my dream. She has a different face, but still just as pretty and the same soothing expression. Almost immediately after I'm caught off-guard, I feel at home with her. I know it's my girl. I know how she makes me feel, how her hands feel when she locks them with mine. I know how her hair feels as I **** her head and back when she leans on me. I know her soft breathing. Everything feels so familiar, so... right.

I go to her and give her a big hug. She's warm. She feels like that cozy blanket that you never want to get out off during a cold night. She pulls back and looks at me and smiles. I'm so happy. She asks me what I thought about her IG stories, her voice so pleasant. I just laugh and say nothing as I shake my head thinking, ""she's absolutely crazy, announcing us to everyone that way"".  She holds my hand and we start walking. By this point in my dream, I'm not longer aware that it's a dream. 

And then I woke up feeling light and happy. I felt rested though I got only about 5 hours of sleep. I wanted to go back my dream for just a little longer, but failed no matter how hard I tried. I realised that if I tried to force it, I would just be using my conscious mind to write the script, so, I got up with the bittersweetness.
Some people say that while we dream, we are connected to other universes where our counterparts are actually going through what we see in the dreams. If it's true, then I hope that my counterpart stays happy and in love. I hope that they be each other's forever persons forever.",2024-05-12 16:10:42

I shut my eyes and wished it to turn around and it did! It says lucid dreaming is that you are aware you are dreaming. I didn’t know I was but from then I started to learn that I could control my dreams. I have had numerous lucid dreams ( controlling the story of my dreams) but never aware I’m dreaming. When I am aware I’m dreaming I go into a complete panic. Like I’m gonna be stuck in this weird crazy sub reality where all my worst fears lay. 
     As to controlling my dreams I can’t just put myself on a beach with some secret crush. I can only turn nightmares a little better. Like detour the major threat. Also make good dreams just a little better. Like if I’m talking to a crush at a party and someone I’m insecure or intimidated by walks up in my dream I say go away, and poof she’s gone.
    I should give a better example of a good dream… like you are getting to pet and play with your dead dog or cat. Time has run out and the pet starts to walk off. I say no more time and it will happen.",2024-05-12 16:00:57
33,Dreams,Personality’s of people in dreams,What do you guys think of this. In my dreams peopme I know in real life always have like single trait personalities in my dreams. In my dreams one of my friends is alway really mean and controlling and my boyfriend is always evil does this mean that this is my true perception of them or does it mean nothing ,2024-05-12 15:57:58
34,Dreams,Childhood dream,"When I was a child I had this reoccurring dream about the Grim Reaper. He was never after me, only my mother. When I was young we lived in a suburban home where I had the most of these dreams. The first one was I was playing outside and looked into the living room window.( which was big)Saw my mom standing there watching me. All of a sudden he came around with his sickle in front of her neck. The next was my mom was sitting on the backyard porch, right by the sliding glass door. All I could really see was her hand on the arm rest. As I drew closer her hand slowly faded into bones, then I went closer and a head came into view and it was him. The last one that I can remember was we had moved to the country. We had a black ford pick up truck and in my dream we were using it to pick up fire wood.( which we did )  she was bent over the bed of the truck looking down. I turned and saw him sickle in hand, raised above her head.
       Not to interesting I know, but my mother had a bad pill addiction for years. The subconscious is a crazy thing",2024-05-12 15:40:38
35,Dreams,I met the helpful wolf again and this time I got her name!,"This is a follow-up to this:

I was heading towards Bohemia this time and I came to a place in the forest where the road met with a small river and there was a bee hive above in one of the trees. I had a halberd with me and a sack of stuff, but that was it, and I could not climb the tree, so I started trying to whack the beehive out of the tree with my polearm but I could only just barely reach it if I jumped.

**** (Luba?) showed up and asked me if I was for the King or for the Kaiser, I said I am neither at present and just wishing to eat something sweet, so then I showed her my issue. She then proceeded to do a twisting jump and snatched the hive, limb and all, from the tree and then dove quickly into the water to avoid getting stung and killed the bees.

We then split the hive and I gave her my thanks. I bowed, introduced myself properly this time, and she reciprocated before then taking her leave. She said she was bound for Ruthenia. I just spent the last hour or so trying to figure out where this one is supposed to have taken place, with my only clue being the forest and the recollection that the river was the Reng.

From what I can tell, the river is the Regen and it was somewhere along Bundesstraße 11 in the Böhmerwald. My best guess is that this was sometime during the Hussite Wars, after Vytautas became King of Bohemia.",2024-05-12 15:33:04
36,Dreams,The sun exploding,"Last night I had an extremely vivid dream. It’s very rare for me to have these. I was sitting in the back of my friends pickup truck at night when one of my other friends tells us to look up at the sun. For some reason in this dream the sun being out and night wasn’t unusual. But what was unusual was that when I looked up and saw the sun it was unusually big and kinda looked like it was melting. There were these flares coming off the bottom of the sun and it slowly moved up the sun. It looked like it was starting to engulf itself from the bottom up. My friends and I watched in shock but it was the most beautiful thing that I had ever seen. And i remember it’s beauty was more mind blowing to me than the fact the literal sun was about to explode. Idk why I felt like posting this here, ik it sounds kinda ****, maybe someone can give me some sort of meaning to the dream? Or maybe you just find it interesting idk.",2024-05-12 15:15:59

38,Dreams,do mispelled words have any significance in dreams?,"I had a strange dream last night where two unnaturally tall men in black suits and sunglasses were standing outside the door in the dead of night, not saying a word even after my mum and I opened the door, only for them to slip a letter through the letterbox.

I remember it in bold, black text on a yellow background: EVACAVICUATION NOTICE. I even knew it was mispelt in the dream, and neither of us could tell if they meant 'evacuation' or 'eviction'.

There is a little more to this dream but that part specifically has been stuck with me all day and it's been a little unsettling.",2024-05-12 14:18:40
39,Dreams,"New to the subreddit, kinda have some questions.","So, I started to type out my dream from last night but realized I dream in a excruciatingly odd way that requires so much explanation that I basically typed out a 2 chapter book to explain what in real time for me, felt like maybe, a 5 minute scene from a show. But the act of explaining it all could be that larger portion of sub plot in a book.

I've had horrible nightmares majority of my life. I remember most of my dreams well because sadly my brain usually tortures me at night, the problem is, a lot of its more a feeling of knowing it without experiencing it. Im going to try to explain what I mean the best I can because Ive never tried putting this into words before. I've been told everyone dreams differently just based on the way they process information so if this is a normal thing please let me know haha. Imagine standing in a fully furnished room. While standing there your staring at a single object. Logic says the memory should be ""I remember standing there, looking at a specific point"" but for me, in dreams my brain follows almost a reverse flow, I experience everything in chronological order, while also my mind is flooded with details of the past as I go forward as if experiencing them both in real time. So I may dream Im standing in a room, looking at an object. While that's the entire dream, my brain also tells me ""okay, to be standing there you had to enter the room, are you standing at a door way or had you walked further in, that decides where the door would be and the size of the room. Im getting ""this"" feeling because of the vibe in the room, the vibes based off my surrounds which meanst x,y, z must be whats around the room furnishing it. Well I'm look at this thing because it's the reason Im in here or maybe because it's not supposed to be in here, which means I wasn't in here before, I came from a hallway, was it one I know, or someone else's, if it's someone else's why a I there?"" And these aren't questions and answers I think about after I wake up, but just things that it feels like I experienced and know all at once in the dream based off what I'm dreaming. I may not have dreamt everything leading up to me standing in the room, but I retain the memory of ""feeling"" as though I experienced it. And while it's a 2 second dream of me just standing there, my mind floods with 10minutes of what I call  ""dream memory"" all at once.  This is probably the most dumbed down and easiest way to can possibly explain it. Sometimes it really is that simple, other times like with my dream last night I just flat out intake an entire universe of lore and backstory by simply dreaming something like ""I sat a table talking with person  A, B, and C.""

In anycase, I guess I'm making this as an introductory post to chat some with yall, find out if anyone wants to discuss or share how their dream memories take shape. Is my dream process normal or am I weird(I'm definitely weird) I'll be sharing my dream some time today, I've already journaled it, and while it makes sense to me the effort of making it legible to the masses makes me feel like this introductory post is needed.


Edit; Oh... I just looked at some of the post tagged with the Long Dream flair and realized how much mine looks like a novel in comparison ;n; Am I gonna get roasted for sharing a book?",2024-05-12 14:15:06
40,Dreams,i had a very intense dream last night and have been feeling like i have motion sickness from this dream all day - does this happen to anyone else?,"title! but to go into a bit more detail:

i have been having very intense dreams for a long time. they tend to happen more frequently when i'm going through something stressful in my life. anyways i had a very intense dream last night that consisted of a lot of difference scenes but the main theme was that i was on a boat/on a moving vessel, and that said boats/vessels were throwing me around inside of them due to choppy seas/there being some sort of distorted gravity. the only way i can think of describing this is like in inception when they're in the dream and the room is legit spinning and they're all being thrown around but there's still some gravity??? there was a lot more to it but i don't really remember everything that happened and if i tried to type it all out this post would be long as frick idk ANYWAYS!!!

does anyone else experience motion sickness after they have an intense dream like this? i slept from about 11pm last night until about 10:30am this morning. it is now almost 2pm and i still feel dizzy/like my calibration is off in my body if that makes sense. 

if anyone has any advice as to how to fix this or move through it pls lmk. 

(side note: i have been taking a new sleeping medication on and off to help with these dreams (25mg of hydroxyzine before bed) but i haven't taken it the past couple nights so i didnt think it was that) (if anyone has experience with hydroxyzine pls lmk thx)

okay thank u happy dreaming ",2024-05-12 13:52:06
41,Dreams,i have no idea how to describe this,"the dream starts with me LARPing with my cousins. we were pretending to fight a battle? or something? i was pretending to hurt them, that's all i really remember. we weren't on earth? it was like some weird hybrid of the green hill world from sonic, minecraft, and legos? i mentioned it looked like minecraft and the world literally started crumbling and fell apart, sending me and my cousins into the void. suddenly, i was teleported to a shopping mall with my grandma. i was completely **** and begging my grandma to buy me clothes, but she was too angry that i hurt my cousins. i tried to tell her it wasn't real, but she wouldn't hear any of it and just kept yelling as i stood there crying and trying to cover myself up. i managed to find something to wrap around myself, but then i started running around on all fours, screaming and crying. i was once again teleported somewhere else. it was this weird maze of just.. windows? i was still upset that my grandma wouldn't buy me clothes, so i started just punching and breaking all the windows, trying to get out. it didn't seem to end. i just kept breaking more and more windows and getting more and more frustrated that i couldn't get out of this place. apparently all of that was a flashback and i had actually killed myself, and the window place was just a representation of my anger that no one cared enough to stop me. i think i was then at my funeral? everyone was shocked and in disbelief that i was gone. i, in like a ghost-like state, was standing there screaming and crying that i left plenty of signs and they only started caring after it was too late. i am teleported again into a long hallway. my mom is at the end of it, on the phone and trying to find me a new therapist because the one i had wasn't working and my mental health was getting worse. she's on the phone telling them that i'm awful, ungrateful, rude, and all these other horrible things. i approach her and she tells the person on the phone ""it's all my fault"" and i yell ""of course it is!"" at her. i am once again teleported to the window rooms, where i am still continuing to shatter and break all the windows. i woke up, and for a split second, i thought about calling someone because i didn't want the events of the dream to happen.

They are in the city I lived in for a long time and have been missing. In this skyway off to the side was a concrete tube like the kind you see water coming out if into retention ponds. ( Obviously this would never be in real life) This one was big and an elephant trunk was coming out and then its head. It seemed happy and its trunk was raised and moving a bit. I thought it was cool to see an elephant but we kept walking and I was going to call the city to tell them. Then I woke up. Any thoughts?

45,Dreams,Meeting Celebrities,"Alright, I’ve been dreaming very vividly all my life and have a pretty great memory of my dreams. Anyways, I was curious. I’m not lucid in these for the most part, but I’ve met celebrities in my dreams. 

I met Justin Bieber and Donald Trump (separately) at Disney World

Met Dwayne “The Rock” Johnson delivering food to his house

And met Trump a second time outside of a museum near a beach, this one I was lucid for.

So I’m just curious if any of y’all have encountered celebrities in your dreams. If so, did you actually get to meet and talk with them?",2024-05-12 13:26:11
46,Dreams,Dreamed I accidentally entered a woman's house...,"I realized it was inhabited and was afraid of getting in trouble for trespassing. Then I discovered she treated me as her husband. The rest of the family came home and treated me the same (as if I was the husband of this woman). I was really confused, and wanted to leave, but thought if I just ran they'd get suspicious that I was a trespasser. So, I just waited for a good opportunity to leave. We moved into a large sitting room with lots of books, and I saw a painting on the wall of the family, and the husband looked identical to me. I was taken aback, and then wondered what would happen if he came home and wanted to get out even more. Then I woke up.",2024-05-12 13:01:27
47,Dreams,i had a very upsetting nightmare,"So i just woke up and i am tearing up.

I genuinely believe this dream might have some meaning. My dad is about to go to work and i’ve been thinking of terrible situations that i could get in where it involved him getting hurt. I love my dad so much and pray to **** he won’t get hurt. Does this dream mean anything though? Can someone tell me?",2024-05-12 13:01:19
48,Dreams,My ex has been haunting my dreams for years,"The most recent relationship that I was in ended 5 or 6 years ago in utter catastrophe. She was wonderful - borderline wife material - and the whole time we were together, it felt like she was doing everything in her power to prove that to me. I wasn't anywhere near mature enough to be in a serious relationship.
I ruined everything and cut ties with her a long time ago by now. I haven't seen her face or heard her voice in so long that I almost forgot what she looks and sounds like. I actively wanted to forget everything about her for so long, and part of me still does want to forget, even today. I moved on a long time ago, way before we stopped talking and cut ties, and I've had more than a few crushes and relationships since we broke up and before we even stopped talking completely.
A few years after we stopped talking I started having hyper-realistic dreams about her that almost always feel more like nightmares and I don't know why.
Sometimes, its dreams about her being in danger and running to me for help for some reason, and I never know what to do to.
Sometimes, its dreams about intimacy where she's in the mood and I'm not, but she doesnt respect my boundaries so whatever she wants ends up happening anyways against my will. I always wake up crying from those dreams. In the unwanted intimacy dreams, whenever I resist her advances or fight back, she gets upset and starts screaming at me.
Whenever I have a dream that she isn't a part of, she appears out of thin air and completely steals control of the dream from me, often changing the entire setting or grabbing me and somehow dragging me into a different dream entirely.
I've had dreams that she died too. More of those type of dreams than any other. Whenever I ask her if she's okay or still alive irl in these dreams she actually reacts like a real person would instead or ignoring me or saying something nonsensical or glitching out like a buggy game suddenly crashing like my friends, family, and coworkers tend to do when I try to talk to them in my dreams. Whenever I ask ger if she's okay/alive and why shes in my dreams so often, she either smiles warmly in silence like she used to when she would talk about our future, or she starts sobbing, and then she hugs me so tightly and for so long that I wake up because it feels like I'm actually being hugged irl.
I woke up from another one like that just now, and we were talking at length about all of this, but I hardly remember any of what we were saying.
Has this ever happened to any of you? What was your reaction to it? Should I seek professional help or perscription meds to make this stop?
On the one hand, I feel like this is super unhealthy, and at this rate I don't see myself being in any other romantic relationships for the rest of my life. On the other hand, it gives me much needed closure whenever I see or hear my ex in my dreams, and at this point I don't even find her recurring presence in my dreams to be unpleasant.
I also worry about this a LOT because she and her mother are Wiccan/Pagan and self-proclaimed witches and she still has a lot of my stuff including all my best hoodies. I never asked for any of it back, and I've heard that some women of her faith use the personal belongings of a subject/target when doing rituals - especially rituals that have anything to do with dreams.
I've been trying to ignore this but I feel like I'm losing my mind a little.",2024-05-12 12:44:57

I have never had a dream where I see myself moving around and doing things. But I recently read a post on here that they only dream in third person and a lot of the comments agreed. They only dream as they were watching themselves in a movie. So I was wondering if people could comment and I could see if there was a big difference with this or maybe it will be 50/50.

57,Dreams,"I live more in my dreams, than reality?","Every night in my sleep, I go on scary adventures. I know its me in the dream, as if I am in a video game or something and stuck. Even if I have awareness that its a dream while I am in it- I can't make myself wake up. When I reflect back to 2018 I visually see a divide in my life. It was the end of the beginning. Cut every single family member, extended, family acquaintances, anyone from high school, college, my hometown, anyone in my old classes that I didn't even talk to. Everyone. I moved away to a city where idk anyone. So it is essentially, a completely new beginning. So in my dreams, I go back into those environments, with those people. Its so vivid. I am re-living my past, as if its me in the present, time traveling back to that dynamic or something. I dont like my past so I dont like reliving it. This tells me that my body believes my family is more important to me than I like to make myself believe. During my near death experience, when they say your life flashes before your eyes- it really does. It was as if my entire life with my family members was all smooshed into one that I saw all at once. I never told anyone this, because I dont like to think my family means something to me, or that I miss them. 

  
Then, mall world. I have been going there since I can remember in my dreams. It isn't necessarily scary though. But recently, the past 2 years, and every single night for the past few months: I am in a train terminal. Its similar to mall world, but there is the busy platform. During the dream I ""feel"" panic, uncertainty of where I am going, if I will catch the train, if I will die on the train and its dangerous for some reason. I am always there and its the same train terminal each night. Again, I have awareness its me, while dreaming, so its like I am in a video game or something. 

Other trends throughout the years that come/go: airplanes. I am terrified of them and havent been on one in 15 years due to the last traumatizing experience. However, I dream to travel the world and it holds me back. Again, I dont tell people this because I am ashamed to admit I am afraid to fly. In my dreams, there are always familiar faces of old friends. I die almost every plane ride in my dream, and its a scary death. Like torture. I feel the fear in me while its happening. Other times though, I am in an old plane that is flying extremely low to the ground so that its impossible to get in an accident, making me able to travel. Then, ferries. I am always at the coast waiting for a ferry in turbulent waters. Less death, more uncertainty. 

Theres night terrors, usually in airplanes. It all has to do with travel. But my lifestyle- I was homeless for so long...I want to travel....I am stuck right now in my life with a lot of stress but making big changes! Like, I was in abusive environment, escaped to college, couch surfed and lived off streets for 10 years after cutting off family to start from ground zero, got into **** work to get out of it, saved up all my money, got myself my own apartment in great location of city, paying my way through a masters program and almost finished, have a side business for my art and am getting a robot. I have no relationships though. I know I will be successful its just weird right now. I am trying to escape the world of vices and **** work, to have a more normal lifestyle. ",2024-05-12 11:44:52
58,Dreams,Was this a lucid dream or regular dream,"For some context this dream was actually very long and i remembered it very well when i woke  up. I also know for a fact that i was only asleep for an hour while this was happening because i saw the clock before and after falling asleep. I will skip the 2 segments before the ""lucid"" part and just start from there. I was in my grandparents house eating shrimp when for some reason i realized I was dreaming. ( at this point i got really excited and actually told myself to calm down so i don't wake up)I told my grandparents and they did not believe me. so I then tried to fly and failed but I was able to jump very high. I then tried to create shrimp out of thin air and failed but when i dropped the shrimp it disappeared. I then recalled my coworker telling me he had a lucid dream once and he decided to steal candy from a store(he was already in the store when he realized) so I decided I wanted to do that. After a random encounter I won't get into i got into a truck with my brother to drive to 7/11 he then told me to drive through a lake which of course destroyed the truck, and seemingly forgetting i was in control of the dream i didn't try any tricks to get it out we just pushed it out with our hands. (at some point the truck became a toy car as well) after we got the toy car out and driving the dream ended. My question is whether this was really a lucid dream or is it possible my ""character"" in the dream thought it was a dream when I myself didn't actually? I ask this because I could not fly nor create shrimp out of thin air. The only thing i did from that point is get ready to go to the store. So was this a really lame lucid dream or potentially not actually one at all.",2024-05-12 11:44:48
59,Dreams,I had a crazy dream is there a meaning to it,"I don’t remember the whole thing but here are the pointers

Background :-
I am 20M in a tough time right now 
(I recently dropped out of college n my parents didn’t take it well because I was using drugs for the past 2 years and I told them so they felt betrayed and are sending me abroad but I m facing some issues with my admission and am stressed about how will I explain my drop during the visa interview)

- It started with me having dreams where I started going to school again in my 12th standard and I would freak out and wake up when I realised that I have already finished my 12th in real life and what would I tell my parents why am I going to school again

- i told my parents about my drug use and due to this problem they don’t let me leave the house many days passed and my resolve to stay clean started getting stronger. So one day I dreamt about killing a guy who was nice to me and I read about it online that we **** in our dreams when we let go of habits and that dead guy being nice was true as I liked him and I liked drugs 

But it kept getting weirder 
My dreams about me going back to school increased more in intensity I’d wake up every time and after that I started having dreams where some meteor would destroy the whole world but I was safe behind a door in my class or my school washroom 

Then one day I dreamt about a girl 
An invisible one 
We got married and after the marriage we kissed though she was invisible she was wearing clothes which I could see (kinda like invisible man where only his clothes were visible) when I kissed her it was okay but then she kissed me again and her face opened wide and she tried eating half of my face 
Terror ran through my heart and I woke up all sweaty and my heart beating like a car’s engine 
I didn’t think much of it but now a week later it’s been bothering me 
What was that is there any real meaning to dreams 
Or am I just too stressed and alone that I’m making my own patterns 
And is there any way that I can stop this back to school dream it’s really stressing me out.

60,Dreams,so um.,i had a lucid dream where if i lay on my bed back facing and stare at the ceiling i would ascend through the ceiling and become shamura from cult of the lamb and my first instinct was to run out of my house,2024-05-12 11:41:30
61,Dreams,The Dream That Mirrored Reality: A Spooky Encounter,"Last night, I experienced a dream that sent shivers down my spine and left me questioning reality. As I stood in my dream, engaging in a lively conversation with multiple people, everything seemed normal until an eerie silence fell upon us all at once. Confused, I turned to see everyone's gaze fixed on the doorway behind me, where my bedroom door should be. 

That's when I woke up to the sound of my husband, a police officer returning from his night shift, entering through our bedroom door. The synchronicity between my dream and reality left me startled, to say the least. Has anyone else ever had a dream that seemed to predict or mirror real-life events? I'd love to hear your experiences and interpretations.",2024-05-12 11:35:18
62,Dreams,Consecutive Nightmares?,"Last night I went to sleep around 1am which is fairly normal for me. I was having a hard time falling asleep, when I finally did I dreamt that I was curled up in the living room with my family watching a movie, I got up to do something and found what looked like an apple watch, except it had been torn apart and modified, it wouldn’t turn on and had a small blinking red light, I instantly knew it was a tracking device. I woke up after this dream, switched the youtube video I had playing to something more relaxing and fell back asleep, for the next hour and a half or so I would dream, wake up, change my position a bit, and fall back asleep. This exact chain of events happened maybe 10 times between 1am-2:45. Every dream was bad, I was being chased, stalked, or tracked. Every scenario was different and I really only remember the details of the first one. 2:45 when I woke up the last time I was drenched in sweat despite not feeling overly warm. I rolled over for the first time, fell back asleep and slept the rest of the night.

The oddest part is I almost never dream, maybe once a month I have a dream where I can remember very basic details. I did not eat anything new, different, or at all before bed. I didn’t do anything out of the ordinary. I know a bunch of people are saying they’ve had odd dreams with the aurora borealis outbreak. I just find it odd that every dream had the same theme despite never being stalked or tracked in my life, or knowing anyone who has. I’ve never noticed a fear of this before. The only thing that I could assume had something to do with this was ****/lack of. I often smoke in the evening, it helps wind me down from the day. Recently I’ve been cutting back, trying not to smoke every day or taking a week long break. I wouldn’t consider my usage a “bad habit” I have strong control over the desire to smoke, and the main reason I’ve cut back is to clear some of the brain fog. Last night was the first night I haven’t smoked in about a week. **** has never seemed to have an effect on my dreams before. Any ideas?",2024-05-12 11:24:04
63,Dreams,bad dream has been ruining me,"i don’t know what to do or where to post this so i’m just asking for help or any sort of advice you can give, just under a week ago i had the most vivid dream of my life, i had not taken any substances that day or before i slept, however it was the first full night of sleep i had gotten in a very long while. The dream summarized, had been full of me finding out secrets about my family that led to more and more confusion until my family had gotten into a big conflict that quickly escalated until i threatened my stepdad with a gun, he confidently said something very hurtful (which i don’t remember) and i killed him. After that i had gone to school and everyone wanted to start issues with me but i just kept hurting them until this included my closest friends, this clearly happened in the dream because recently i had gotten into a physical altercation at school that resulted in me hurting snd very seriously injuring someone that was a grade younger than me, anyways back to the dream

i had started trying to live in abandoned homes i could find while finding substances to abuse, until i had met a friend and we had just stayed around in these houses together until he found out i had killed my stepdad, and he just disappeared. 

i woke up shortly after, but this dream has messed with me more than any substance ive ever taken, it has constantly replayed in my head any time i come near anything that reminds me of the dream, and has often left me confused with what events have really happened and what was just in the dream, i can still clearly remember almost every detail of the dream which doesn’t ever happen to me, and it has ruined my perception of my relationships with people, does anyone have any advice? i can answer any questions you have

65,Dreams,I’ve had 4 dreams of my boyfriend cheating on me ,"This is the fourth dream I’ve had about him cheating on me. Worst part is when I told him about my dream he got **** off and says they’re just dreams. And we’ve fought a lot in the 7 months we’ve been together like to the point I probably should’ve left him but I love him too much. 
But this dream he texted me that he was going down the road for a bit while I was at a family function. And when he came back he told me he cheated on me and said to smell his **** and it was red like she was on her period and he was laughing in my face about it and then started tormenting me like he has irl in the past so I grabbed his keys so he couldn’t leave and then he started chasing me for them. He had zero remorse for cheating on me and he acted almost like he was proud of it and didn’t care he hurt me. And I kept slapping him in the head every time he said he confirmed he cheated. 

The worst part is yesterday he said he’s gonna have to find another girlfriend to have **** with him cause we haven’t in 3 days (my period is coming and I literally just don’t want to have ****) so I can see how the dream came to be but to have 4 dreams now of him cheating on me is a bit insane. Also the fact he can’t respect me not wanting to have **** is bad I know.. 
In the past one of our fights he called me a **** and said he cheated on me cause I was a **** (he was also belligerently ****) but **** people don’t usually lie so idk what to think. 
He can be extremely mean and hurtful to me and then act like im the problem and then other times he treats me like im his world so I honestly have no idea if he would or has actually cheated on me. 
It’s really upsetting me tho that he just gets **** at me for my dreams. No reassurance ever (he’s not capable of that emotion) ",2024-05-12 11:05:02

68,Dreams,Dreamt of a friendly owl. Is it an omen or my late mom?,"Context: 
Today’s my first Mother’s Day without my mother. She passed Sept 2023. Three months before she passed, I saw 3 owls perched on a rooftop in our neighborhood.
I’ve been having relationship problems with my boyfriend of 7 years and struggling to detach. I slept at his house last night and slept so deeply and dreamt of an owl so vividly.

Dream:
I was in a vacation home with bf &amp; sister. (Sister hates him irl.) Boyfriend was in a bathroom getting ready and I was standing in the doorway talking to him. An owl flies through the window and perched on the bathroom counter. Looks at me, looks at him, looks around. I was in awe since I’ve never seen an owl so close. I called my sister over and as I reached to pet it, she stopped me and warned me of its powerful bite. I went to pet it anyways and it hopped on the floor and acted like a friendly cat wanting pets. The three of us were petting this owl and I woke up.

Thoughts??? Thanks in advance!
+ Happy Mother’s Day 🩷

69,Dreams,I’m actually really lonely,"This might be my most depressing dream. Well not THE MOST but very personal. 

I was at the park in my neighborhood and I saw this girl, we locked eyes and I thought this girl was very attractive. We didn’t interact until I got off the swing and she told me that “You should hang out with my friends and I!!” Three girls came out of the back gate (where I live the backyards face towards the playground because the park is very hidden.) they all introduced themselves to me and I remember thinking “This is what the universe meant with new opportunities!!! Thank you ****!” I was so happy….this was the one dream where I wasn’t aware. They all decided on a game to play like hide and go seek but with the whole neighborhood. We would use a group chat app where the hider would tell hints of where they’re at… I remember we all separated but the app for me wasn’t working and I couldn’t find any connection to anything. I couldn’t communicate with them at all….i went back home…It looked like the app started working again but then it lagged out…and I sort of kind of lost them?? Anyways I woke up and I felt really sad because these girls wanted to hangout with me. 

I’ve always wanted to have a friend group, I’ve been wishing for a solid friend that gets me and wants to do the same things as me. I do have friends but we don’t really have anything in common. I’m an outsider. 

When these girls came I felt like my wish came true and I thought “I’m finally going to have the time of my life!” 

It’s funny because this dream was the most normal. My dreams are crazy weird apocalyptic/prophetic dreams…and this was the one that hit me hard. It was such a let down. 
It’s like waking up from a pregnancy/baby dream. It’s like when someone roasts you and they hit you with insecurity. ",2024-05-12 10:43:40
70,Dreams,"Dream about war crimes, the twin towers, Eric Cartman, and Robot me giving the church money.","\[Disclaimer: My dream has some sensitive topics (the twin towers, and I guess some other things), so just a disclaimer, if you are sensitive to such topics.\]

I had a total of three separate dreams, for a minute I would see into Dream 1, and then for the next Dream 2. While Dream 3 was just at the end of my sleep. So for Dream 1, I would see some random, bearded, guy in the desert, and I would hop into his truck, which interestingly had various weapons such as ak-47's, grenades, and a machine gun, and others those are the only ones I could fully remember. We would basically commit mass **** in different areas with such weapons, and would run way in time, so that the police wouldn't catch us. That was the entirety of dream 1, committing war crimes. Dream 2, so I was in some random neighborhood, with the character of Eric Cartman. We would then compete, in a challenge, of who could build the bigger twin towers out of sand, we could constantly knock each others down, and eventually I became so tired, I gave up, and Cartman won the ""competition."" For Dream 3, I was a robot and me and others gave the church money. (I am diehard Christian, so I guess that is where I got that dream from???)",2024-05-12 10:31:27
71,Dreams,Recurring dreams of massive storms and hail. ,"Hi all I've been having frequent recurring dreams lately about severe apocalyptic storms and hailstorms. These dreams often depict dark clouds gathering before a severe and sudden storm breaks out.

Hail is the most common type of storm that I see in these dreams. Often these hailstorms are insanely sudden and destructive. So much so that they always seem to destroy and break there way into my house and smash things up with ice.

In one of these dreams I woke up only to find my house and bedroom full of holes and the back garden absolutely pummeled and in ruin from the hailstorm. 

In other dreams I am just minding my own business inside when I see a huge and sudden storm breakout outside with lightning and wind and destruction. In all of these dreams interestingly I am inside looking outside at the storm and never out in it. 

Any thoughts on what could be the meaning or cause of all these recurring dreams?",2024-05-12 10:26:45
72,Dreams,Old West nightmare,Just woke up from a terrifying nightmare. I was in the old West with a partner and we decided to rob a store on our journey to wherever we were going. Well they caught up with me and threw me down in a basement. They threw me to against a wall and a large man with a whip on one hip and a gun on the other stood ten feet away from me me and I started to pray. My eyes were shut and I was curled up in a ball not knowing whether I was getting the whip or the pistol. I was praying for my life when my roommate woke me up asking for a ride to work. Yeesh. I really felt like I was about to die or be maimed or both. I'm on a medication and it has caused me to have the most vivid dreams I have ever had on my life.

74,Dreams,Someone/something in my dreams is keeping me from lucid dreaming.,"Little context here. Throughout my life I had all kinds of nightmares (falling,  drowning, being chased etc.) but as I grew older they all basically dissapeared or got very rare and were replaced by a single one. I am not much of a lucid dreamer, but when I notice something is off, when I notice I am actually dreaming I have this strong feeling of threat, that I am somewhere I shouldn't be and someone/something is coming to kick me out of there, punish me for even realising that what is happening around me isn't real. I usually woke up screaming as I figured out that wakes me up the fastest. Sometimes it didn't even let me wake up. I woke up in my bed, but not for real, it was still a dream. Once I went trough about 5 loops before I woke up for real. Terryfing experience. 

I even gave it a name thinking it will help me deal with it. I was calling it ""bubák"", which basically means ""monster"". That was all I got, no face, no shape or form, just feeling. This went on for years. It was happening once every two or three months sometimes once a month. I haven't found any pattern whatsoever. 

Then one day, about a year ago, something strange happened. I met him. Yes, him. Again, i figured out I'm in a dream, felt something coming, woke up sweating, but then fell asleep again. I dreamt about the same place as before and he was there. Older, bald guy in a suit. And I just somehow knew he was the one chasing me. We talked for a bit. I don't remember much from the conversation just that he is making my dreams for me. The good and the bad ones. I gave him new name. ""Snář"" meaning a dream-maker. Never had that nightmare since. Sometimes before sleep I even requested some dreams from him and sometimes I actually dreamt about it, even pretty vividly.

This was until about three months back the nightmare reapeared. The feeling of being somewhere I shouldn't and that something is comming. But this time I found the source pretty fast, because I know what I was looking for. What surprised me is, that it wasn't the dream-maker, it was a woman. So far I've seen her twice and I'm waiting for my chance to face her like her predecesor and, I dunno, ask what she wants from me?

If you read this whole text, thank you. Did any of you have similar experience? Can anyone tell me why my own mind is stopping me from lucid dreaming? I never really studied all this dream interpretation etc. but I really wanna know what is my head trying to tell me. What are they protecting me from, why I'm not allowed there?
I'd be glad for any help or even just a word of reassurance that I am not the only one having these dreams.

P.S. From what I remeber I had bunch of lucid dreams as a kid, and I remember them pretty well, but since my teenage years, when this ""entity"" apeared I never had a single one.

75,Dreams,Do Dreams Really Serve a Deeper Purpose?,"Context: When I was young and even now to be honest, I was very attached to Nintendo consoles. Mainly the DS because it helped escape reality and dark tensions I had when I was younger.  I would always play Pokemon Heartgold on my Red DSI XL and bought it with my own Birthday Money. I played the **** out of it, and it was the year I was going to move into a different house. I remember placing it in a drawer down my living room hallway, and the next morning it is gone. Like clipped out of reality and entered the backrooms. Tried searching for it, never found it and gave up. When I became nostalgic for it in my new house, I would search with my little brother in our storage room that had old furniture and stuff that we used to use and maybe my mom placed in there when we settled. **** my little brother had to tolerate my troubles, love him to death.

My Dream: I had a dream where I was in front of my old house, I felt 10 years old again, but the neighborhood was empty and a little run down and abandoned. My neighborhood was full of town houses and has a huge grass field behind the town houses that separates the houses with a forest that goes for a couple miles far. The grass field was an indent in comparison to the neighborhood, because it had sewages connected to it, with those huge sewage holes you could see underneath. So like from the grass field you had to walk up to the townhouses because the field was lower in height. Anyway, I was walking through the field in my dream and see my house and enter through the back door. I see one single thing, and it is a box full of EVERY single thing I have lost in my life including the Red DSI XL and the Pokemon Heartgold Cartridge. I play it and play it, and I suddenly become 18 again in my new house, but this time with my Red DSI and Pokemon Heartgold Catridge. I wake up, in astonishment. Because I haven’t thought of the DS in years.

Question: Is this a meaning from **** that the DS is nearby and I could potentially find it? Or is it just the attachment to it has caused me to dream about after so long? ",2024-05-12 10:02:06
76,Dreams,I have a recurring dream I only get when I sleep in the daytime. It's so staggeringly beautiful I often try to go back. ,"Every Sunday I get up at 5am to walk with my oldest best friend. It's a tradition we've had since we were young. 
When I get home I sometimes feel like going back to bed for an hour and I always have the same dream. Kind of!

I live in Yorkshire England. It has been my home town since birth. When I was in my twenties (I am M40 now) I lived in London on my own for three years. When I think back on it I feel like I miss it terribly. I sometimes go on Google maps at work or at home and just walk the streets where I hung out with my London friends. 
When I sleep on a Sunday I always without fail dream I am back in London. I dream of old friends and sometimes strangers that are wonderful. 
There's a feeling while I am dreaming, like I'm home. Like I'm where I belong. My heart is so full and I am so happy it's intense. 
Sometimes I'm not in London, I'll be just in a new place with new friends I've made in the dream but they'll feel really valuable. 
In almost all of them there is a girl. The same girl I have never met in life, she is either in the dream directly or I can feel she lives in that world. As though she is a phonecall away, living in the next house/room or like she is with me like a girlfriend would be but you're not together at that particular time. 
My heart feels full, like I'm thinking about her the whole time I'm dreaming of doing nice things with friends. 

Every walk, every party, every task feels like I'm in our shared world where we love eachother intensely wether we are together in the dream or not and each time I wake up I still keep that terrifically massive feeling of good heartache and I'm confused for a few seconds until I take in my surroundings properly. 
Just now I woke and thought I honestly was back in London and I was missing my home in Yorkshire but happy I was in my 'girlfriend's' world. 
I wasn't though, I was here in Yorkshire still. 
It's probably important to mention I'm a divorcee. I am living alone and living a relatively good life. No kids, some great friends but no love sadly. I don't feel like I am open for that. 
I presume it's just my mind making up for what I do not have in life. 
That feeling though, that feeling I have in dreams is so unbelievably beautiful and happy it's like that first love you feel but for a place too. I find myself trying to sleep whenever I can to go back there. Just felt like sharing it for some reason  :)",2024-05-12 09:31:41

81,Dreams,I dreamt I was with the love of my life. Why does she only exist in my dreams?,"This was one of those dreams that had multiple scenes. We were together in many of them, or I was on my way to go meet her somewhere, or we were parting ways and making plans to see each other later.

We walked together. We sat together. We talked together. We dreamed together. Sometimes we were with other people and everyone knew that we belonged to each other. It was as if we had been committed to each other for years.

In one scene, I saw her sitting on a park bench. I tried to approach her but I couldn’t walk forward any further. The gravity felt so heavy, it pushed me to the ground. I tried crawling towards her but no matter how hard I exerted myself I kept slipping further and further backwards. The wind picked up, lifted me into the air, and blew me away from her.

There was another scene where we went to some sort of performance. There was a stage, and we went to find seats in the audience. She went ahead of me, and I followed. She found a seat near some people she knew, and she saved me a spot next to her. I felt so loved and acknowledged. Like, “Wow, you’re surrounded by all these friends and yet you would save a seat for *me* to be beside you?”

In another scene we were about to part ways when she mentioned something about remembering to bring flowers, but I wasn’t sure what she meant. Later, I was on my way to her apartment. Along the way I was stopped by some mutual acquaintances and I realized during the conversation that I was on my way to propose to her, and it seemed like everyone else knew it before I did. I was already close to where she lived, and I didn’t want to be late. So I started wondering, “Where am I supposed to find flowers? Can I even show up without them?” I began searching for flowers, but nothing I found were real. I woke up before I was able to find any…",2024-05-12 08:52:49

I noticed there were a bunch of owls in my compartment for some reason, so I went out to the train's restaurant compartment - which looked more like a bar, tbh - and asked the conductor/bartender guy what was up with all the owls.

&amp;#x200B;

He casually informed me (in a tone that implied this was all perfectly normal) that it was ""Owl Night"", an annual thing where the owls ride this train all the way to the end for some reason. 

&amp;#x200B;

Soon enough there were owls all over the place. Most of them were oddly colored, with feathers alternating between white, green and orange (I'd say roughly in the hues of the Irish flag; note, I'm Swedish, not Irish). I ended up on my back on the floor, completely covered in owls. It was fine, kind of relaxing really, they weren't all that heavy.

The owls standing on my face then telepathically assured me that I had nothing to worry about, they were always very careful not to step on anyone's eyes. They were very polite about the whole thing.",2024-05-12 08:06:33
84,Dreams,Crazy man in friends house I felt so weak,"So I had a dream where I was at this big house it seemed like a place where teens/ young adults would go if they didn't have somewhere. I was going to visit a friend (I see time to time in waking life) and he had two brothers in the dream.
 There was someone at the door that I let in and as soon as this friend saw who it was he told his brothers to run, it seemed like a father figure but he was crazy wide eyes and all and he seemed angry.
 I tried pulling him out of the house and it was slightly working, he wasn't struggling too much but I was putting my all into it, all of a sudden my shorter coworker (from waking life) showed up from inside the house and helped me get him out with ease, and is saying things like wow you really never have been in a fight have you? You're so weak.
 There was a part where I smashed a little camera that was remote controlled by the mad man, but it was a distraction, I got a call from the friend that he needed help asap.
 I went up to where they were and they were trapped in a fort with this madman wide eyed just staring at them. He put his wide eyes on me and there were people coming in from a balcony area behind him and they were panicked but made it by and my friend and his brothers escaped from the fort.
 All I could see was they made it safely out and this dude just staring at me, right before I wake up he gave me a nasty smirk that's still giving me a creepy feeling I woke up panicked.

85,Dreams,I dreamt of a woman in white…..,"Hey Reddit,

Need your help to better understand this dream, long story short:

-Had a dream where I am on a rooftop event with friends/family, all positive people. Could not identify who they were but I was loved by all and having a good time

-People would point behind me and say “I don’t like her or she’s giving us a bad feeling” when I turned around there was a tanned woman dress in a white dress, wet dark hair, where her eyes/mouth were there were black holes and face blurry. I would walk and move around but she would stay behind me no matter what I did.

-I rebuked her in the Lords name and picked her over my head then threw her off the roof onto the street. I sensed a sudden urge of relief and knew this wasn’t a human being.

Just wanted to know your thoughts on this since I don’t usually remember my dreams but this one I did.",2024-05-12 07:29:49
86,Dreams,Passing Out In a Dream ," I just woke up from a dream that was kind of freaky so I'll try my best to describe it. During the dream I was back in a school on a clasd vacation with a girl I used to be extemely close with and another guy we went to school with from like middle school. My mom was also on this vacation with us. I'll spare the other details but suddenly I guess I passed out during the dream. It felt like a real break where the dream was just gone, like it had abruptly ended but I wasn't awake yet. Then, dreaming still, I woke up in my mom's car home back at my old middle school. I'm very confused and wondering what happened,  thought I had fallen asleep or was late to something but realized I was in an entirely different place than before and none of the same people were with me. I see a bunch of teachers huddled outside the school start walking in, so O get out of the car and follow them inside. I find a nurse who seems very concerned and tells me I passed out and I had to be given a medicine right away, but I told her ""I'm pregnant"" (I am in real life) so she says I can't have it and that I need to talk to the doctors now. During this time with the nurse I keep trying to touch my face and legs but I can't feel them. The doctors come in and ask if I know what they are worried about. I say no and then one hands me a sticky note where they have written down like ""sudden imminent death"" or something. And then I wake up. I feel like I was lucid dream or something potentially? The second half of the dream felt so real, the confusion was very much real and I was genuinely freaked out. I have never ""passed out"" in a dream before, and especially didn't expect it to feel like an actual loss of consciousness. ",2024-05-12 06:55:30
87,Dreams,Solving a game in my dreams,"Hello!

I often dream about situations in my dreams that I have to solve. They are reoccurring until I find the solution. They present themselves as video games. Sometimes I'm able to change the game settings.

Right now it's a management game. I have a moving building on a planet with hostile monsters. I have to manage energy for the building (like the living quarters) and for defense (laser turret?). The problem is that I run out of energy so quickly. Killing mobs and pouring their juice in the system gives me energy but right now I chose to only beat the small kind, a swarm of tiny one, which is inefficient. I am constantly moving the building to avoid the giant ones that could damage my building and my team but I am running out of juice. I don't find medium sized mobs.

I wake up every time I lose but this is getting frustrating. I don't lucid dream but I remember suggestion I had in real life and act accordingly so any advice is welcomed. Thank you.",2024-05-12 06:48:01

89,Dreams,An unnerving dream,"The mother of my kids came to me about a dream. Her and I are no longer together and we often argue. She’s dealing with some health issues and will soon be having an **** removed. Last night she expressed her concerns about a dream to me. She said that in her dream she was playing with the kids and while she couldn’t see the presence, she could feel the energy and it felt looming and heavy but not malevolent. The voice told her that the best thing she can do is get her kids comfortable. Any take away here? I’m sure the pressure from the issues she’s dealing with compounded by the tension between us caused this to manifest. Open to hear what others have to say.",2024-05-12 06:34:46
90,Dreams,I’ve never had a dream like this. What could it mean?,"It all started off very normally, don’t remember much of it. But then out of the blue I got into a car and set out searching for my brother who had died a year prior to my birth where I met this young girl, she was glowing and I’ve never seen her in my life. She started giving me life advice and giving me little pendants of fairies/angels(?) made out of dirt. at first she was very soft spoken, but then she changed. Like she knew I wouldn’t listen to her. At the end she led me to a beautiful cliff side that I can’t forget and pushed me off where I somehow fell and it didn’t hurt me but I instead lightly floated down where she gave me a final piece of advice. She told me to stop searching for what I’m looking for (she said specifically what but it’s personal). What does all this mean? What was she/it? I don’t even remember her face.",2024-05-12 06:00:59

I can recall a few nights ago I was in a ferry and the walls were moulded with a dark wood. I can even recall the details of the mouldings, but the dream itself was not about the ferry. As days go by the plot of the dream becomes a blur, but the details of the ferry remain. This happens often in various places.

These woman and men dressed in robes and mask such as king Baldwin wore type mask. These people were apart of a group I forget the name. But they kept looking at this image that was in like a Museum type inclosure with glass guarding it and were like trying to figure out what it meant or something but then they took me and branded me on my right forearm/ hand with the exact same imagine of mother marry looking into a Triskelion when they did this it felt like my real conscious came into that dream the fear was unbelievable and I instantly knew it was the mark of the beast I woke up shortly after and it wasn’t like I was waking up I woke up with the same thoughts and frantic motions as like I was still in the dream .

93,Dreams,decided to share my dream if it had any meaning,"first, i was working at some dancing pool, with a dolphin, everyone had their own parts but i accidentaly failed mine and got kicked out, i was homeless and stole food from Minecraft villagers, i also appeared in my school and was very scared to go downstairs but closed my eyes and just made it, then in the next section, i saw my father (he is dead right now) sleeping on his and my mom's bed in Ukraine (my birthplace, which I'm moving to soon) i started chanting his name and trying to wake him up (because of the next part) and my mom started chanting his name too but crying, in the next section my computer has some really really corruptive malware, not being able to work properly and be deleted, it was just sections of weird versions of games i know, including my favourite which scared me a lot in the dream, and it was based about Masha and the bear, it also has.. &gt;!****?...!&lt; so yeah it was very weird, then i played a game with granny in it and she gave me cake, i took a bite in the ""game"" and she told me to share it with the baby with a knife next to me, and then the baby's face turned scary and red or something, later i woke up since i heard my mom and told her the dream.",2024-05-12 05:27:02
94,Dreams,Looking for Answers in A Nightmare I had.,"I, 33 female, had a nightmare last night. What I remember clearly from the dream was that I had been sleeping in this house with my parents. My parents were in a small bedroom on a small bed. And I had been sleeping under a blanket on the floor in the living room under a large window. It was very dark and windy outside, maybe there was lightning. But, there was a constant tapping on the window. (When I woke up in real life I realized it was actually the ceiling fan in my bedroom that was making the real noise, but in the dream, the tapping was something more terrifying to me.) Back to the dream, I was searching around the window for the source of this tapping noise. It was something bad, I could sense it. I moved into the entrance of the home where there was a big beautiful, but old red wood door with a big window on it. I opened it to peak outside to see what was tapping. I don't remember seeing anything outside, I just remember being really scared. I go to the bedroom where my parents are asleep, and in an almost sleep paralysis stupor, I tried to tell my mom about the scary tapping outside the front window. I could hardly speak, similar to the feeling of struggling to speak through sleep paralysis (or scream). My dad had rolled over and not really saying anything in the dream rolled back to sleep telling my mom to do the same because I was bothering them. At least that was the face he made. Although my mom was concerned. She also went back to sleep. I was scared, but moved on. The dream suddenly shifted. I don't remember how I got there, but, I was suddenly in another bedroom in the house looking under the bed, I saw a wet baby diaper. (the same diaper my daughter is currently wearing, which led me to assume it was her.) I grabbed for it and was able to pull it out. And then I looked back under this bed, and there was a clean diaper and the sound of a baby crying. I grabbed for the diaper, and suddenly there was a babies leg, I grabbed the leg and struggled to pull this baby out from under the bed. And there was definitely something under the bed pulling her away from me. For the life of me I would not let go of this babies leg, and I was able to also grab ahold of her arm. All while trying to scream for my parents who were in the other room, but I still had that stifled sleep paralysis scream, I could not make the sound come out. After a little further struggle with this faceless baby I woke up. Back to reality, I realized the tapping was the fan in real life and my own sweet baby was still cuddled in my arms in between my husband and myself. I woke my husband and we spoke positive words to make me feel better. But it was a truly horrifying dream. Although it doesn't seem like it is too scary, inside that dream I was terrified and it follow me into the waking world.

  
I guess I am mainly trying to figure out if anyone knows any meanings, there seems to be a lot of important symbolism, including my parents, my own feeling of being a child in the dream, and then my own child being in the dream as well. The red wood door, the sleep paralysis. I tried to look it up but wasn't sure how to proceed. 

  
Thank you for your time, I appreciate any answers I can receive. Have a beautiful day, and if any of you are mothers, Happy Mother's Day.",2024-05-12 04:49:00

96,Dreams,Dreamed of head on collision,"It's 3am and I cannot fall back asleep after an adrenaline high of a fatal accident. I was at some kind of sporting event it's night time. A friend from college that lives in another state (haven't talked to in a while walks out with me). I get to my car she walks to hers. Idk what kinda car I am in big black suv I think. I navigate leaving a tight parking lot full of vehicles in the dark. Not a lot of street lights and everything seems wet like after a rain. The streets are reflecting the light from the few of the street lights there are. The turns to get out of the parking lot are kinda confusing. Theirs paint on the road giving directions but hard to see with the light reflecting of the wet surface. Somehow following the paint on the road I end up crossing some 4 lanes of an 8 lane highway. I just roll right thru without looking but luckily there are no cars in sight. I'm in the middle median. Idk which was is what. I dont see any do not enter signs. Idk what direction this next part of the highway goes I'm all turned around. I turn right I think **** dream me decision. I start to see cars coming my way and I'm like oh ****. So I go to slow down and get back into the middle median when a car hits my head on. I'm airborne and know I'm going to die right as I'm startled awake. 

I have a little bit of a long drive tomorrow 2hrs there and 2hrs back. Part of it will be on an interstate.  Now I'm wide **** away and kinda trying to figure out if I should cancel. 

When I read interpretations of the dream it says I'm about to come face to face with a huge confrontation with someone. Idk I don't have any big issues right now or anyone I could imagine confronting or needing to confront me. 

Also please give me some grace if I have terrible Grammer or misspelling. It's 3 something in the morning. ",2024-05-12 03:50:44
97,Dreams,I just had an extremely terrifying dream and now i’m scared,"Hello all.

I’m a vivid dreamer, which usually has its benefits. However, it also has its flaws. I apologize if this post sounds a little fragmented, i’m still in shock and I just woke up, lol.

I just woke up from a nightmare in which I died as my world was going to ****. 

It starts out where i’m at work, and we get evacuated because of those phrogger people. The cops told my coworkers and I they had to investigate in case of more threats. 

So my coworkers and I try to soothe ourselves after this experience by going to our favorite theme park. There, rides keep breaking and we find out the police are there too. Some kinda cyber attack.

Defeated, I decided to go home. Upon arriving home and trying to decompress and figure out what is going on, I'm greeted by my 77 year old grandmother. I live with her, this is not unusual. However, as soon as she tells me she figured out whatever she need to remember, i see and hear something fall from the sky with orange embers on it. It wasn't too close but I can feel the pit of my stomach sinking.

another object with those embers flew into the house across the street, before my grandma could say ""what was that"" a loud
boom woke me up. 

i woke up with my heart racing, being extremely nervous and confused, and with a fear of going back to sleep.

how do i calm down?

if it helps i have ADD and usually use medicated products for sleep but I am sadly out and cannot refill till monday. ",2024-05-12 03:22:28

I can only think about 2 times where I was in first person in a dream and it only lasted for a small portion of the dream, them I got sent to 3rd person and couldn't come back to 1st.

So, do you also only dream in 3rd person?",2024-05-12 03:11:20

Nightmare #1 - There was a snake in my house (not too fond of them, rather afraid) and it was on my bed. I tried to get away in time but it kept attacking me and biting me. This was replaying most of the night and I kept waking up multiple times. 

Nightmare #2 - This was just tonight actually. I looked down and saw something under my nail and went to get it out. Next thing I know, entire leaves are coming from under my full nail bed on every nail. I can't find anything relating to this online. 

Any ideas what my dreams are trying to tell me or if it's just super random things?

102,Dreams,Had a dream about Snapchat having a dog furry mascot,"So I had a dream where Snapchat has a dog furry mascot named ""E1147"" or something. He wore a green shirt with the Snapchat icon on it and he had orange fur. One day I was in a car with my parents and my mom was the one driving my car and for some reason the car started to float very high, then my phone rang and it was from my girlfriend. I answered it but I couldn't hear her voice because it was too noisy. Then someone else messaged me something and it was the Snapchat dog mascot. I tried tell him to stop messaging me and he said ""Don't be mean, I just wanna talk with you!"" or something similiar to that. Then when I went back to the call, the person I was calling wasn't my girlfriend, It was the Snapchat dog. After that, I randomly teleported to my house and found the Snapchat dog in my room dancing with his rainbow gummy animal friends?...then after that he offered me a peanut butter flavoured popsicle and it didn't really taste that good. It tastes like frozen raisins. It may look like a short dream because of the explanation, but it was a pretty long dream for me. ",2024-05-12 02:37:51
103,Dreams,Has anyone else had these dreams.,"PS ENGLISH IS NOT MY FIRST LANGUAGE AND IM NOT GOOD AT PUNCTUATION

I’ve been sleeping but had to share this dream I had just a second ago I had a dream that I could only put as a amazing feeling but a terrible feeling I had a dream that I knew everything, the meaning of life,what’s really out there,is religion real,etc and it was euphoric I felt at peace with everything everything was perfect but I was terrified while I was feeling this way I could see and feel bad about everyone because they wouldn’t know they would never know and if I tried to tell people I would be labeled as a cultist and I wouldn’t want that and that is when the worst part happened I realized I knew EVERYTHING I was everything I knew what was in space and it was scary I’ve never done any illegal drugs in my entire life but I looked up about people who took DMT because a person who was my friend would talk about these things and it reminded me of it and it was weird I saw what these people saw in my dream but under no influence and then i looked up info about DMT and it is a chemical in the brain which has me wondering,What is real???? I can’t even think of religion now because what I felt was so real but the part that worried me am I already dead?? But alive and just being born at the same time and then I looked that up and it’s called the “growing block theory” but I have to say I will still believe what I believe and I can’t really believe this dream well because it’s a dream but I’m scared that I saw something I shouldn’t have and now I can’t sleep and I’m sitting on the couch watching tv.",2024-05-12 02:13:45

blink the whole time.

105,Dreams,I need to share this dream and how it made me feel.,"Im just gonna jump right into it. For reference there are a few parts I might embellish for the sake of having it be cohesive but I won’t change any significant parts of the story. 

My dream starts off with my friend and I in a small town. Think Gilmore Girls style town with ma and pa shops and a tiny fire station. To the right was a curved road that went up a hill to a diner. Farther up that hill winded up to a snowy cliff side view of the town. It was clear it was a different decade, probably the 80s or so. 

We were outsiders in this tight-knit community but everyone was friendly and kind to us as we made our way around the town. We talked to townsfolk, made relationships with different people and even developed romantic flings. It felt like it was over a long period of time, maybe weeks in the dream. 

We had a secret though. The whole time, my friend and I knew the future and the town was going to be blown to smithereens with no survivors or buildings intact. We had no idea why we were put there or what we were intended to do, all we knew is we were unable to prevent the explosion in any way. So all we did was wait. 

We went about like normal everyday and didn’t tell a soul what we knew. Finally the time had come for the town to be obliterated and in that moment I realized I was in a dream. It was like I had complete control over my body and I was slapping myself to wake up while the town began to rumble. The rumbling got louder until the fire of the explosion was barreling towards me. At that moment everything turned slow motion as cars and street lamps were hurling towards me in a fiery blaze. The memories of that town flashed through my head one last time and then everything was back to normal speed. The flames engulfed me and I immediately shot up out of bed. 

At the same time, my friend also shot up from his sleep and we looked at each other realizing we both had shared the same dream through our own perspectives. Was the dream we shared a simulation or a premonition of something? Before we could figure it out I woke up. I had had a dream inside of a dream and now I was fully awake in real life. 

While I did my best to explain the premise of the dream I had, I cannot put into words how realistic my feelings and thoughts and actions were while I was in that town. I don’t remember the details now but there were full stories and characters and situations we had gotten into while in this dream town that felt like weeks had gone by and the feelings I shared with the actual feeling of touch I recall made me feel like I was reliving a memory not a dream. 

It was just such an indescribably amazing and euphoric dream, not because of the events that took place but because of how insanely real it felt. There’s something I felt too in that dream I couldn’t possibly put into words if I tried. Just so so weird and something I’ve never experienced before with a dream. Wanted to share mainly so that I never forget but also as maybe an entertaining story. 

Thanks for reading!  ",2024-05-12 01:59:45

He sounds like he's in distress and when I ask him what's wrong he tells me that he has court and that he might go to jail, so I ask him where the courthouse is at and he says ""It's in my bedroom."" Then I proceed to walk around the mall aimlessly trying to find his bedroom.


Then I stop and WWE wrestler Big Show is there and I ask him where the courthouse is which he then shows me directions for, he's also wearing a suit and tie and is apparently representing this guy in court.


Then I get to the courthouse and then the literal Greek Gods turn out to be the judges, then later as I leave a random voice is explaining the lore about Hades to me.

Then another portion of my dream consisted of me meeting my boyfriend with another girl, who was the girl he had ended up with because I hadn’t met him (like I didn’t exist in the world until that point and/or I was seeing an alternate universe). I fully saw a different girl and had an entire conversation with her. There were other interactions similar to this but I can’t remember them.

116,Dreams,Dream of a Construction site,"
I had an odd dream last night. I slept late, around 3:20 am, partly due to the fact that I took long naps throughout the afternoon. Let's get started with the story. Basically, my brother needed money quickly and was told to come to this construction site, which was right outside the apartment we lived in. I went with him in a pickup truck (we don't have one in real life) and sat in the backseat while he drove to the site. Once we arrived and he was traversing the rough construction floor, I saw a severed head on the floor with no body and noticed many lifeless bodies as we moved in the car. In that moment, something made me think that the dead corpses were due to workers falling or getting their heads sliced by their own machines. As we were driving, we came to a stop. I truly understood why my brother came to the construction site. It was to pick up this old, brutally injured, skinny, almost flattened man who looked like he was dying. He was placed in the front passenger seat while I glimpsed at him from the back. After this, we left and went back to our apartment garage. Something happened in this garage tho... I just can't remember. But please, someone help. I'm truly scared. What does this mean?",2024-05-11 23:36:13
117,Dreams,May 11th 2024 ,"when it was morning in this day 
I've had another dream where I was in the room I slept at and someone was at my door knocking and asking me questions about something about hunting down ""maps"" and how it doesn't exist as a word and they were blantely accusing me of things I don't think twice about what they are implying and then I hear them going on their phone which I think they are just scrolling the through social media because I keep hearing that one song that starts playing which sounded like some alternate version of gorrilaz's music

But I dont get why they would ask me some **** questions while they are at my door while I stay sleeping shut in my bed Not answering anything they said because I think they might be people who broke into my house or Idk But then I woke up from that dream but the room felt the same way as what my dream has been like",2024-05-11 23:25:19
118,Dreams,Very weird nightmare + specific date mentioned in dream?,"Hi yall,

Feeling kinda weird. Been trying to shake this feeling. Had a nightmare that my boyfriend cheated on me and abandoned me for someone else (someone we both know). I was very devastated in this dream but there was a voice that kept echoing saying “May 6th. Check May 6th.” I’m really confused, check what on May 6th?! The day already passed and idk what I should be looking for. I’ve been depressed all day, I can barely eat and it’s actually affecting me way more than I think a dream should. Any suggestions on what specifically it could be leading me to?

Thank you all",2024-05-11 23:21:26

121,Dreams,i slept for 12+ hours and dreamt i was trapped in a serial killer summer camp. pls analyze. ,"I slept from 7pm-8am post-finals, and this was the first time in months where i slept more than 6 hours. i had a dream that started off normal, i was dropped off at some type of summer camp/activity thing. i meet a girl before the camp and exchange instagram handles with her, and we become acquaintances. when we get to the camp, it’s run by crazy people (??) who take away our phones and any contact with the outside world.

then, there is an animal roasting in a giant commercial oven (i’m vegetarian since birth and have no desire to eat animals) and all of the campers are forced to walk through it and eat it to make it to the next “level”. what these levels are for? idk. 

basically i am hesitant while everyone else does it robotically as if it is normal. eventually i do it and then there are a bunch of other weird gory tasks we have to do. oh also we all are assigned different names. i vividly remember that the acquaintance was named chloe, but i accidentally call her that instead of her “assigned” name and i get yelled at by the leaders. i was always yelled at and had to defend my actions but never physically hurt. 

me and the acquaintance hatch a plan to escape, and eventually we are back on a bus. this is when the road looks familiar, and when i look out, it is the street to turn into my best friend’s neighborhood. i tell chloe (the acquaintance) that if we get off here we can get back home, but for some reason we don’t make an effort to stop the bus. eventually it keeps going and leads us back to the camp. 

i have a lot of weird things going on in my life rn (i am stressed af!!) so please analyze this dream and lmk what you think it means 🫡🫡",2024-05-11 22:32:23
122,Dreams,Weird dream about my abusive ex,"I recently had such a vivid and disturbing dream of performing a **** act on my abusive ex who I cut contact with over a year ago.

It was very odd because there was a group of people around who were trying to encourage me to watch her have **** with other women. I wanted no parts of it and was in distress when no one would acknowledge that she abused and cheated on me. The whole time my ex was reveling in my disgust and frustration. 

Then, when the group started pressing me to join in, I began to **** and looked down to find that I had a **** (I’m a 22F btw). I was still in the body of a woman, just with a ****, and I ended up **** onto my ex’s face. A door appeared out of nowhere, and as she was kneeling and wiping her face, I closed the door, then just walked away. The weirdest thing about it is that she seemed to have enjoyed it, yet I wasn’t actually aroused in the dream. If anything I was angry and the act felt out of spite. 

For some reason, I was extremely vindicated by this and when I woke up, I felt relieved (?) in a way. I’m so confused by this, and I needed to share this with someone so I can make sense of it. I feel like such a ****. ",2024-05-11 22:19:50

126,Dreams,Horrid Henry dream,"Hi! I literally just had a dream that I was playing as Henry in a horrid Henry horror game. It was like a spin off where suddenly the game would turn extremely dark and the mother would begin chasing you to eat you. 

Later on in the game you’d have to avoid being killed by your brother and father by hiding under beds, closing doors to slow them down, and I even discovered an ending where if you sneak out of your room while a murderer is in it, you can start a huge fire in the other room with a gas canister and a lighter. Ends with the house ablaze as you leave the house. 

Thought it was interesting! A little scary since even if I’m aware it’s a video game I can unfortunately still physically feel things like getting stabbed or grabbed, and can feel my heart racing. ",2024-05-11 21:34:04
127,Dreams,"The stuff my brain comes up with when I'm like, 10% asleep is remarkable","These have to be dreams, but I'm amazed at the stories and images my brain can come up with when I am only slightly under the surface of consciousness. I might be sitting in my computer chair, fighting sleep, my eyelids heavy, and before I know it I'm watching some nonsensical, multi-layered scenario that I snap out of and go ""what in the **** was that"".

Just now I went to lay on my bed for a while, and never really went to sleep. I don't know how deeply I went under, but I felt like I could wake up at any time. Still, I experienced a dream that was so cool and creative, I had to share it.

It started off like a TV show. I was following Cassian Andor from Star Wars as he tried to escape some place and a guy called in a fancy sci-fi ship for him. He got on and was taken to a group of people who were having some kind of creepy cult get together and intended to **** him. They were dressed in a sort of Elden Ring/early 1700s America fashion and everyone had revolvers that fired explosive bullets. There was a family letting their bratty adult son do the killing, and he was supposed to **** Andor, or me, or my character, I can't remember...after a few clever delays, and asking for a bullet (because they gave you a revolver to make the killing honorable) it turned into a boss fight with some awesome mechanics that you might see in a FromSoftware game. The son was trying to shoot you and you could run around and dodge but his bullets would usually find you. I quickly learned to use the large crowd of partygoers as human shields, and most of them were just onlookers who tried to get out of your way. I remember the way they stood with unnaturally perfect posture and just stared at you like robots, it was great. At one point I figured out that you can grab gifts like a jewelry box off a table and throw it near the son, and he would get distracted. That seemed like your opening to do some damage. I could do sick flip jumps and way more acrobatic dodges than in a FromSoftware game and IIRC there was even some complex hand to hand mechanics like the CQC in Metal Gear Solid. I wish I could describe the look of it better, but the costume design, the animation during the ""cutscene"" before the boss fight started...it was all so good.

129,Dreams,Dream Highlights,"I had a few dreams today, that I wrote down minutes ago. I woke up all morning, tired and lethargic but unable to sleep comfortably. I needed to tilt my head in different angles because the melatonin was making my face fuzzy. 

In the first dream that was good enough to write about, I was in a narrow apartment. The walls were thin, the room was vacant. I picked up a camera off the floor, a vintage one. It looked like it was from the early 2000s. I was wearing a rammstein shirt. I wanted to look at my **** through the viewfinder. Curiously. I dipped the camera down, seeing my shirt. I didn't want to see my upper chest and the camera was too heavy. A guy walked inside, catching me. He was a vampy guy. He and the rest of his roommates had thrown me out, which seemed like it took forever/slowly. 

Outside, with a group of people behind me. I was being dragged back, clung onto by strangers. Don't know if it was the same people. I saw a smashing pumpkins exhibit/display. Gish era billy approached me, then stopped. We made eyecontact for a moment, which was probably my brain becoming lucid. 

I went to class, later seeing Billy Corgan as my teacher. The classmates went to lunch, leaving me alone. The building looked like a mall from where I was standing. He sat down with me outside the classroom door, on the floor. We talked with eachother. 

Later, it looked like we were in a toysrus. He asked me what I thought the 50s-60s childhood was like. *'Pastels, morsels, anthropomorphic animals, easter,'* and a couple other things I forgot. I saw fluffy pastel cotton candy forming as I was saying this, mentally playing back what I said, too. People bombarded him, ruining our peaceful conversation.  

I was then at my home, seeing two of my best friends. My friend from middle school, and my internet friend. I haven't spoken to either in years, and they don't know eachother. They remind me of one another, because they're very similar. Down to their voices, included. My old friend had a plate with green cakes in it. Some had shamrock confetti sprinkles on it, identical to the little debbie ones. That one was for me because of my birth month. My other friend was upstairs, in my mom's bedroom. I stood on the bottom of the staircase, knowing this. I grabbed the shamrock cakes from her, following my friend outside because she was leaving. I was half ****, looking for clothes to put on. Facing the back of the house, I saw different shirts scattered and on clothes hangers, small for summer. A stitched tank I put aside first, not finding it nice enough to wear. I vaguely remember seeing a black knit top, subversive, probably even mesh. I saw a gray tank with a faded pink on it, reminiscent of the aurora lights last night. My first friend I ever had happened to have the name aurora. Get this, summer for the second friend. Dreams are synchronically accurate. That is normal for me because I have no life. I see synchronicity in everything. 

In my the last dream, I was sitting in a childlike tunnel hallway with my mom and little brother. They mentioned men who were killed by their female partner. The hallway was red-orange, like a chuck e cheese sky tube tunnel. My brother was probably talking in the other room with my mom before I woke up. I immediately responded, *'Uh, courtney ****-homely **** love?'* My mom didn't respond back, which **** me off. She seemed indifferent like she didn't believe that. In real life, she does now. Back in the day, she didn't at first. I woke up not long after this.

*'We can't go on together, with suspicious minds.'* has been playing through my head repeatedly; as I woke up. Before I fell asleep, the line billy delivers in, 'we only come out at night' was lulling me into sleep. *'And once again now..'* Ironic/dark since, the next verse is 'It will help you sleep at night..'

131,Dreams,Waking yourself up from a dream,"I’ve never found anyone else who can do this so out of sheer curiosity, here goes.
For as long as I can remember, I don’t have nightmares. This is simply because when I’m dreaming, and I get that weird eerie feeling that it’s going to turn into a nightmare, I can just open my eyes and I’m awake. 
I can only recall one time I couldn’t do this. I have also woken myself up from usual dreams, so it isn’t just a nightmare thing. Something triggers me to go lucid for a moment, and I can just wake up. (I must say I rarely have lucid dreams, but often have vivid dreams).
Everyone I’ve ever mentioned this to doesn’t seem to get what I mean? I’ve had friends who suffer from chronic nightmares and growing up I would ask why they didn’t just wake up- I thought everyone could do it.
I wondered if anyone else here has this ability or has experienced this. ",2024-05-11 20:23:31

Weird part is- I just left the needle in there? I remember being in the car and twisting the needle and I got all woozy as if i was gunna faint- didn't though. the dream continued until i woke up.
When i woke up, i remembered that woozy feeling and wondered what would happen if you ""fainted"" in your dream? would you wake up? time-skip? or would you just fall into a different dream? this stuff fascinates me!

Yesterday, I dreamed that I picked up my phone to check something and I realized that  I recorded a video of me having a mental breakdown without remembering it. I screamed in the dream  and I woke up screaming.

135,Dreams,My dream from a month ago tricked me into believing my cousin died ,"Day 39. I had a dream that I was in my cousin’s home. My grandma and dad were there. A fire broke out in Xinjiang. They’re telling to hurry and pack my stuff. 

But somehow they also need to talk to the embassy to get me checked out? The embassy registration guy told me (in English ****) that I need to upload a picture of my recreation of a face drawing. I was skeptical but they said I had to, so I did. It turned out pretty alright, but messed up on the proportions. Then my grandma took a video of four different face sketches putting them in as mine, but some were not mine. Maybe they were my cousin’s?

I then had to use the bathroom, so I looked downstairs and the toilet was flooded. So I headed to the second floor instead, where my uncle and aunt lived. It was alright. 

I headed down the downstairs, and seeing my grandma and dad kneeling over the papers on the table. 

I then remember that my cousin wasn’t alive anymore. Feeling sad because it was a car accident or heat **** or something. 

End of dream. 

Edit: when I woke up, I realized that my cousin was indeed alive, but it was another dream I had a month ago that tricked me.

136,Dreams,I never dreamt in my life and they sound super cool and I'm very jealous of you all,"I just never dream, at all. I mean, okay, before someone corrects me, I know that everyone dreams and it's literally impossible not to dream, etc... But like, you know what I mean. I don't remember any of them. I don't even remember that I dreamt anything at all. I fall asleep and then I woke up in the morning, nothing in between, never. Just no dreams at all. And I never dreamed and I have no idea how they look like.

I've been reading this sub because I was curious, just as well as I obviously heard people irl talking about their dreams too, and I have to say, they sounds like the coolest **** ever. Like, you just go to sleep and get stories to entertain you, like ****, I want them too. And they have like weird physics and all kinds of absurd stuff, or at least that's what I read and hear, and I love stuff like that and I'm kinda sad I never experience them. And you actually feel like they are real? I can't even imagine. Not to mention lucid dreaming, that really blows my mind. It just, looking at all the top memes here, it looks so much fun and I'm mildly upset that I don't get them, or to ne more precise, I can't recall anything, not even the fact that I was dreaming, not a single time. 

The other thing I heard people talk about is the moment before you fall asleep, and I still have no idea whether or not that's actually a thing people experience, because I never had anything remotely similar. I can't recall the moment I fall asleep.

So yeah, I just wanted to tell that I am jealous of you guys because dreams sounds extremely fun. Have great dreams on behalf of me too, guys. I hope I'll have one someday.",2024-05-11 19:43:37
137,Dreams,Very (very) consistent nightmares,"Every single night, without fail, for the past 4 months, I’ve had 2-3 nightmares that wake me up sometimes in tears or feeling legitimately shook up

Usually these dreams have one of a couple certain themes: I’m a criminal, the world is at war, or my loved ones have betrayed/abandoned me. Sometimes multiple of these intertwine.

It’s also worth noting that these dreams are usually FAR more vivid than any pleasant dreams I have, although I literally cannot recall having a pleasant dream since January/February 

Last night for example

First dream was about being a Scandinavian soldier fighting nazis in world war 2, after Ice cracks leading to me falling into a freezing lake, a **** ambush occurs and I slowly watch those around me die brutally while I freeze to death. Woke up 3:45am

Second dream I was at the loca mall with my girlfriend. A nuclear air raid siren begins going off, plane sounds, the sky becomes an evil awful orange and suddenly my girlfriend dissapears, leaving me to die alone in a nuclear fire. 6:45ish i Wake up, return back to sleep after messaging my gf asking her to reassure she wouldn’t abandon me in a nuclear bombing haha

Third dream was too outlandish and wacky to explain properly, but it ended with my girlfriend and little brother turning their back on me as I hung from a cliff, before falling to my death

I’ve been smoking **** to dull these dreams. Nothing works. This is getting to my head, these all feel as vivid as real life, it’s been messing with my mental health

138,Dreams,Dream looping ended only by death,"Hey all i see posts here and there about being in loops where you wake up to find yourself in another dream. My prompt is: are there any of you who can only move to another dream level or climb the dreams to actual awakeness by dying in the currently perceived dream and how do you feel about it?

I regularly get stuck in loops where i HAVE to die somehow in order to move onto the next one and eventually wake up. Thus, reality is sometimes heavily questioned for me and that is a whole different topic. I will consciously seek a way to die in the dream and i have a smol concern that i might actually hurt myself one of these days by thinking i am not awake yet. 

I am different people in each of these dreams. Some of the deaths are caused by others (me hiding in a spot where a vehicle will crush me), some environmental (drowning or falling etc), some by my own hand (actively guillotining myself with a window). I can usually get a bit of amusement and wander or climb things against physics but sometimes im just tired of it and want to wake up so i just frantically search for a way to unalive so i can get it over with. It could be 3 levels. It could be 12+.

139,Dreams,Nightmare ever since that one day?,"tl;dr below

Okay so I'm probably fully overreacting? But I've had a traumatic event a couple weeks ago (confirmed by a therapist) and I also stated getting nightmare every since night since approximately that day. It didn't start the exact night though. 

The dreams are all fully different, but in my mind they all have a similar vibe. It's difficult to explain. Like completely different dream but same font?

So could this event just be the reason for this? I'm lowkey sleeping with a nightlight atm because I genuinely wake up scared. Not like fully panicking, I'm quite the reasonable guy, but still afraid and wanting to get light asap.

I don't have my next appointment with my therapist until 2 weeks from now due to her being on vacation. I genuinely just wanna make it stop.

TL;DR : Ever since after an event that caused me ptsd, I have been having nightmares every single night, different but all the same vibe? Seeking advice.",2024-05-11 19:24:58

so after i gathered up my things, we saw a whole cult of satanists, they weren't wearing any cloaks just some of them, they dress like satanists as some of their pieces of clothing has pentagons all over them, some of them who was infront was carrying a book and 2 of them were carrying a lamp which you hold onto a stick, and then as they slowly walk by some of them looked at us and smirked as they passed by, and someway or somehow  we get teleported outside infront of my aunt's house, it was night time and there were torches everywhere as the satanists gather up around us, we were all standing in a line and one of my friend had to come up first to kneel down to a table that has this metal thing that's supposed to support your chin and overall your head as each of my friends answer their questions, it was my turn to move forward and kneel down and then their leader (a tall grey haired old man who's wearing a black cloak like clothing that has hints of silver on each corner) asked my me things against about ****, Like for example (Do you believe in ****?) stuff like that but worse, he asked 4 questions about it and in the last part of the question he asks what the word is related to his previous question and the answer for it was trust, after all of that a woman waved a flag that has red in the front and blue in the back and then they let us go and they made us fall in line and split us into two groups (Blue vs Red) their leader said we're gonna have to **** off the opposite group, so they lined us up infront of each other and a kitchen knife appeared in our hands as the red team charged at us, as i fell back and sat and rested my back on the wall, and then suddenly a guy came up to me and sat down infront of me in a squatting position and poked me with a knife and continued pressing it down on my leg as it dug into my flesh, and then i took the knife and tried grabbing onto it as it sliced my hand, i tried poiting at him as he resisted but i managed to point it at him as i continued to stab him in the face 3 times, and then this girl who was an ex of my guy friend comes up to me as she traps me with two of the knives that surrounded my neck and after that i woke up feeling empty and i feel really different in some sort of way. please tell me what this means.

For starters I usually don't remember my dreams but i had a very different experience some days ago. So during the night by pure chance I met an old friend (I'm male she is female). I never really felt anything towards her we were just good friends and talked a lot but as life went on it died off. So we met and we talked  some we had some drinks, we were with friends. And that's basically how the night went. We did some catching up and well we just had a good time talking. Everyone went home and of course I went to sleep. That night I had most heartbreaking and realistic dream ever. Basically it was like being part of an episode of a crime series. We were chased by some criminal organization. It was very excting somehow. The last thing i remeber from the dreem was with the friend I was talking about. We were facing each other and she looked at me and said ""i'm going to kiss you now"" and then we kissed. It felt so real, it felt excting, new but familiar at the same time, it was like too great of a moment to be real somehow. And then I woke up feeling really bad. Like i was hoping that this a dream at the dream was realty. It was heartbreaking somehow and i feel like i still feel that way. It was such a powerful and perfect moment. Did anyone had an experience like this?

146,Dreams,Dreaming about neglecting multiple animals :(,"For months, I’ve been dreaming about taking care of many small pets, which include: hamsters, birds, lizards, small snakes, and a tarantula.
My room fills with cages and enclosures with these animals, and every time, without fail, my dream self forgets to feed them for months on end, and they end up passing away. There have been multiple times where I would see them eat their own ****, eat their pairs, or even themselves. It’s terrifying, because I wake up crying and looking for these animals, but they don’t exist.

147,Dreams,Why do hugs in dreams feel so amazing ?,"I've had a lot of dreams where I hug people, or am being hugged. And they always feel SOOO amazing. So warm, so good, I feel so safe, it's amazing. I feel all fuzzy and relaxed and comfortable and aaaamazing.  
They're some of my favorite dreams.

Hugs in real life are cool, but nowhere near this level of AMAZING.

Why is that ??? Anyone else experience this ??? 

For example, last night I dreamt about a fictional character from an anime. I don't even watch anime that much, just this one, and the character isn't even CLOSE to being my favorite. So, I don't know why him...   
All dream long, I was a child, and hugging this character SO tight, like a child would. You know, when you're little, in the arms of your parent, resting your head on their shoulder, fully relaxed, secure ? That kind of hug.

Felt so good lol",2024-05-11 17:39:11

151,Dreams,Bears and a game,"I was in the backseat of a car that was offroading up a hill of sorts. For some reason, I was barefoot. Suddenly the car pulled to a stop, and the three other people in the car went outside to deal with a threat. They said they'd be back quickly so their car doors were left open. I hesitated to go outside because I couldn't find suitable shoes in the cabin.

Out of the corner of my eye I see a black bear approaching the side of the car I was sitting in. It started to investigate and stuck its head through the open door in front of me. Someone from the group yelled at me to attack or ""look big and intimidating"", but it sounded like they were saying it directly in my head, like a thought. My view swiveled to the bear as if it were a fixed camera. I tried to yell/growl twice, both coming out as meek and quiet since my throat was dry. As a last attempt I tried puffing myself up and swatting at the bear, but I couldn't move from the seat. The bear then cracked my window and the whole situation froze.

I get pulled out to another version of myself sitting in front of a CRT televison and PS2(?) controller in my hands. Apparently I had failed a quicktime event for some unkonwn game because my controller battery died. A BIOS sound played with an error message, and then I woke abruptly.

This struck me as odd since I rarely remember my dreams when I wake up. I've also never had a PS2. Any thoughts or interpretations appreciated!",2024-05-11 16:05:25

I have nightmares about folks being attacked; bitten even; being out of control; terrorized in some way I can't prevent; it's the worst! 
People seem to thrive on the vulnerability and powerlessness of others--unavoidably--so I mostly leave them alone.  
The only new experiences that stick are the bad ones--like overhearing domestic violence--that you don't have to be in the midst of to be affected by.

153,Dreams,When I was a child I dreamt I was a lady in a spring,"I have a dream that had remained in my memory for almost twenty years now.

I was around 10 to 12 years old I had a dream in which I awoke within the dream in the center of a beautiful shallow pool of water. The bottom of the pool and the rocks and structures in and around it were pale like marble or limestone and the water itself was clear and pristine.

It sat out in the open beneath a sunny blue sky, and looked to be situated in a scenic place, like an ancient bath or fountain built on top of a tree dotted hill. 

As I was in the dream, I took my bewildering surroundings in and then took notice of myself. I had a body that, with muffled, vague confusion I had identified as not my own in that moment. 
I had the body of a grown woman and I wore a  strange multi-piece robe or dress which was made of a light fabric.

It's hard to remember those details well I think because of what came next. I had noticed myself and I began to notice all sorts of people standing around me, looking at me. Some were standing in the water, some on the edges. I cannot clearly recall what they looked like or what expressions they wore. I can only remember it being a crowd of different kinds of people or different age and gender.

Within what felt like a split second of noticing all the people staring at me I was overcome with blinding panic and confusion. All I can remember was feeling panic and wanting to curl up into myself and hide.

I woke up then and kept the dream and it's blurring confusion to myself. But obviously its remained with me all these years later

155,Dreams,Reocurring Childhood Dreams,"Alright, so. I'm a 30m and still vividly remember reoccuring dreams I had as a young child. There was a lot of stress, abuse, and trauma in my childhood so I had many stressful reocurring nightmares. I've been curious about why I've had them my entire life, as they've stuck with me, but have never been able to talk to anybody (professionally) about them. Here are a few examples.

-Around 7-9 I used to have this dream where I was at my grandparents house. The dream would be so vivid and real. It would be a totally normal day at their house. My grandparents and I would be doing different activities. But the one constant is at some point, this weird looking white truck would pull up *extremely* (and unrealistically) fast, and this creepy guy with long hair and dark clothes would roll down his window and look for us. I didn't know who this guy was or what he wanted. I just knew he was bad and we needed to hide from him. So when he pulled up I would rush to find my grandparents and hide until he left. I don't think he ever caught us. But I was always terrified of what would happen if he did.

-Somewhere around the ages of 4-6(?) maybe up to 7, I used to have this dream where these robots on wheels/tracks would chase me through those tunnels that are at Chuck-E-Cheese or some of those old McDonald's. I often frequented both of those places, and thpse tunnels were my favorite. I never had any fear towards them. But each night I would be in a new location. Sometimes underwater, sometimes a desert, jungle, city, etc. But I would always be un these tunnels and these robots would be looking for me and I would have to try and hide/run from them. No clue what they wanted or what they'd do to me if they found me. But I was always trying to evade them in these endless tunnels. 

-Final example, and for ***years*** I didn't know if this was actually a dream or if it was real or what, until I actually asked at some point in my adult life if it actually happened. But somewhere around the ages of 4-6 I would dream of being incredibly sick, and my grandparents (and sometimes mother) pinning me down and force feeding me medicine. Same place, pretty much exact same dream every time. After they gave me the medicine I would feel...idk how to explain it very well, so barenwith me. Very ""heavy,"" and slow, dissociated, and...here's where idk how to explain, but I would feel very ""thick."" Almlst like my body was idk like made out of rocks...? To this day it still feels like something that really happened and I'm not totally convinced it didn't. But my grandmother swears nothing like that happened and she is to sweet and innocent a woman to lie about something like that.

Sorry for the extremely long post, and maybe poor formatting. Thanks for anybody reading and/or trying to help me make sense of this. These dreams aren't something that actively bother me nowadays. I'm moreso just curious. 

Fyi, my trauma never had anything to do with SA, abduction, or idk really anything that would make sense from these dreams. I just know they were much more frequent during more traumatizing/stressful periods of my childhood.

Like for instance I had a dream where I was this hunter who’s name was Jered. Im a female so I’ve always found it strange. There have been other dreams where it feels like I’m living as someone else. In fact that’s how I usually dream. In my dreams, there’s never even someone who looks or acts or feels even remotely like me. I’m just experiencing things from perspective of someone else. So, because I know that most people fr am about themselves doing stuff, and this is pretty weird, I’m wondering if anyone has experienced this or something similar or knows why I’m dreaming like this.

159,Dreams,Had a continuation of a dream that happened YEARS ago.,"Years ago I had a dream that started with an advertisement for paints. By the style and everything and the fact that there was some weird chemical that was supposed to make it better than other paints, I assumed this was taking place in the 80s. Then I was in the consciousness of a girl and I was either found by, adopted by, or the daughter of a woman. I was in this HUGE rectangular room and I wasn't really allowed to leave. There were watercolor paints and brushes inside this desk on the other side of the room. The woman gave me the paints that were advertised in the beginning and because I found them special, I kept waiting to use them. The woman would get upset that I was painting with the old paints and not the new ones. Something happens, she dies and I leave the house with nothing. End of Dream 1.

Now, today I took a small nap and ended up having a dream connected to the other one. I was in the house I currently live in, my family and some of my sisters friends were watching TV and playing videogames. There's a whole thing about my eye being messed up and that's what the beginning is about, it does continue throughout it but I don't think it's super relevant. Then me, my sister, my cousin, my mom, and two guys that I don't think I've met before go to this big building. We're really just looking around, the building is abandoned so everything is disheveled, a bit dirty, and disorganized. We visit about two rooms, I start organizing water color paints that were the closet and looking at what looks like coloring book pages. A lot of them were like cartoony but witchy stuff. This doll on a shelf in said closet starts moving it's head. It kinda responds to us when we say something by moving it's head. I get creeped out and I bounce outta there. 

So the group splits up, the two randos come with me and the others do their own thing. We go into another room and wouldn't you know it? It's the big rectangular room from before. It's way dirtier, there's more furniture and a sheet covering some furniture in the middle. That desk from before is still there by the door. We walk to the other corner of the room where ""my"" bed would have been. There's a racecar bed and dream me was honestly a bit sad that ""my"" bed wasn't there anymore. There were two other beds in the room but they also weren't ""mine"". So me and one of the randos start organizing the desk after looking around and the other one sits by the door. The watercolor paints were usually in a tray thing and there would be indents for the block to sit in. But after moving some of those, there's a crate with big plastic paint bottles. We move it to a different desk with less clutter. I pick one up and I'm looking at the label. The bottles actually look like one of the paint bottles I have in real life, which got dream me excited. I can't actually read anything but the word ""DREAM"" in big, swirly, rainbow text but apparently it was still watercolor paint because dream me was disappointed it wasn't acrylic. It was also watery and I didn't like that either.

I look up and instead of a sheet covering furniture like before, there's rows of tables with kids sitting there. Because this is a dream, we are unphased and me and the rando start organizing some paint brushes. Eventually we turn around and start talking to the kids. (Note: Sometimes dialogue in my dreams is choppy and unfinished but I understand what they're saying. So this isn't completely accurate, but I know I need to put it in a way that makes sense to others.) I say ""Hi kiddos, who are you guys? Why are you here?"". One of them pipes up and says ""I was a Vietnam soldier."" I look at him and I'm confused. He continues ""Whenever I use the paint, I dream about being a soldier riding a horse."" Then a little girl says ""Yea, I swear I used to be a ballerina before I came here and used the paint."" Me and rando who was helping me organize look at each other, then the crate of paints. We're both like ""They were made in the 80s, that's why these things are happening."" 

Then we have to leave. We say bye to the kids and meet up with the others. Everyone else is walking to the car but me and one of the randos stop at the entrance to talk. He's outside but I'm still in the building so we're literally talking inside of the entrance. We just talked about how weird everything is and after more eye stuff, it ends. 

I know that's really long, if you read through it then thank you. Thought it was kinda crazy to have a dream from so long ago continue like that.

160,Dreams,Uncanny dreams,"Since my earliest memories, I would dream of places that were usually crowded but not crowded in my dreams. Where everything is gray and cold. I have dreams where everyone I encounter is strange and uncanny if I ever meet them.

In the last dream I had, I was in a post-apocalyptic, gray place. I was there with what we could call a war criminal and with my family whom I had never approached. The war criminal was trying to give me a coat, I didn't want to take it and I was swearing in all the languages I knew and trying to walk nervously to other places, it was already hot. Finally, he somehow persuaded me to receive it from him and I took the coat he gave me, but I did not wear it. After this incident, I went to my family and started complaining. I was screaming, ""It's hot anyway, why are you trying to give me this?"" I don't remember what happened to the coat, but it didn't matter in my dream from that point on. Then they didn't care much because they were looking for something in this concrete ****. It was like I had some knowledge of what they were looking for, but I wasn't helping at all.

Everywhere was full of gray and **** apartment buildings where no one lived. The streets were empty, there weren't even any cars anywhere, trees were uprooted and there were only **** empty apartments made of concrete. Then I moved away from them and started living in an apartment. There was a teenage girl on the street and a baby that I thought belonged to her. I brought them to my apartment, which was on the top floor of an abandoned apartment building like all other buildings. The baby looked normal, but the girl's eyes were wide open, she was unresponsive and had a very blank look. When you did her a favor or looked at her with a smile, she was trying to smile at you while keeping that empty expression in her eyes. I don't remember us having much, so the food was little and there was no variety, just rice or something, I think. Then I moved them to the adjoining apartment, we were on the same top floor of a building.

A while passed, I think I was helping them and examining other buildings. That girl came to me just as I noticed that a some other building was starting to rot a lot. She started to look at me with an expression on her face as if something bad had happened and was about to happen again, with a meaningless but underlying mischief, like a some kind of lizardish predator. The baby was nowhere to be seen. I left the girl there and went to their apartment, alone. I was thinking about what had happened, I was sure that she had harmed the baby. When I entered the living room, I noticed their beds on the floor and the drops of blood a little further away, and I understood everything. I was afraid to see the body, but I followed the blood anyway, it led to a room that I could access directly from the living room. At that moment I started to think that she killed and ate the child. And I opened the door, it was dark and there was a terror upon me that my heart could not bear. I think I was deciding to **** that girl. I was about to see the scene... And

I woke up covered in sweat with a terrible headache. And i do not understand anything about my dreams. They give me pain, never anything good.",2024-05-11 13:56:12

But now its almost happening every day, dreams coming true from months, days before. Exactly like how i dreamt it. I know its exact because i draw and write down most of my dreams, It'll happen and I'll be like... I dreamt this. And i go through my book and sure enough there it is.

Its only small things though, for example:
i went on a cruise this week, months before i knew i was going on one, i dreamnt my uncle and my little cousin were outside of the screens near the elavators holding eachothers hand. I wrote down that that would never happen because my uncle hates children for one thing, and my little cousin never leaves his mom. and i didnt even know what the cruise looked like??

And even more bazaar, today there was a merchant on a street i was walking in and he sold me this thing you put in your mouth to make sounds. I dreamnt of the same man in the same area, voice, what he sold me, all exact details. Its such randon things.
It happens almost everday now, once or twice, and all of them i have written down. Anyone have any ideas why?",2024-05-11 13:29:06
165,Dreams,A monster was singing about how she was going to eat me.,"I keep having dumb dreams in this same general theme so I guess it's time to mark them as recurring.

I'm in my bed, and I keep getting zapped by lightning. She climbed up out of the side of my bed. She was made of lightning. Red, orange, yellow, blue, all shifting around and shocking me.

She climbed on top of me, held me down, and sang really quietly.

&gt;""Die die die... I'm gonna eat your soul... Die die diiiie, I'm gonna eat your soooul... Gonna fry you up for dinner, no one could ask for more. Your heart's so bleeding tasty, your liver for the onions. Your balls will make my gravy, dessert will be your bunions.""

It was cartoonish morbid stuff, a little funny. But with every single word she was zapping me with lightning and tearing at my skin with her hands. After a while it stopped hurting and I could feel her actual skin under the illusion. I recognized her as being a character from another dream.

""Hey Bucket. You missed me huh?"" Not her real name, obviously. She's a recurring character taking revenge on me. You can guess the context if you wish. I might have made posts about her, don't remember.

She cursed at me, bit my face, and I woke up.

166,Dreams,"My deceased younger brother attacked me in a dream, help interpreting, please...","Last night, I dreamt of my younger brother, who died in 2001 at the age of 29 from cancer. The dream was:

I was in my bedroom, but, for some reason, I had moved the bed against the opposite wall from it’s usual spot, which meant that the headboard was now immediately adjacent to the door rather than on the opposite wall from the door. From the perspective of someone entering the room, the bed in my dream is immediately to the left, with the headboard against the wall through which the door provides access.

I was in bed, but fully awake and sitting upright. My younger brother abruptly entered the room with a coffee mug raised in his right hand, as if he was coming in to attack me by surprise as I lay in bed. However, since the bed was moved to the opposite wall, he entered, walked two steps in, then, confused, turned to look at me, sitting in the bed, behind him.

I did not feel any sense of alarm or panic or even surprise. Then, without saying word, he swung the coffee mug at my head. I simply put my left hand up and easily brushed his arm away. We just looked at each other, no words, no emotion. Then he raised his right hand and swung the coffee mug at me again. This time, I caught the coffee mug in my left hand, and, now motionless, me holding the mug and his hand, we just stared at each other.

Not only were we motionless at this point, but also emotionless. As we stared at each other, wordlessly, I noticed the glasses he was wearing were exactly the same glasses as a pair of glasses I lost in a very serious car accident 4 months ago, an accident in which my beloved bulldog was killed. I fixated on this in the dream, and I thought, Hey, where did you find my glasses?

At that point, I ceased to focus on the glasses, and looked him in the face, but it was no longer his face.

It was my face.

I’m trying to piece this together, because it *feels* important. My younger brother and I squabbling was not unusual while he was alive. However, I never beat him up or attempted to hold dominion over him, never held him down and red-bellied or nougied him or anything like that. The vast majority of our tussles during his life ended just like this one, with me easily parrying any attacks and usually with me saying, “Are you done now?”, then he would just walk away, dejected. So, the actual “fight” in the dream fits precisely with our real-life encounters.

I do not know what to make of him attempting to sneak attack me in bed, nor what to make of him turning to me at the end.

All suggestions welcomed.

167,Dreams,Had one of the craziest dreams ever yesterday,"First post on reddit, idk if anyone will see this, I just want to share it to someone.

Past few days, I've been having these really long weird lucid-ish? dreams that feel kinda exhausting..sometimes I wake up in between too, but they continue..

For example, yesterday I had a dream about waiting for a bus with my father to reach my college. I got into a bus but it was actually a car inside(?) with the driver lying down behind me(????). I was messaging my friend and he kept touching me from behind.
He was a **** and when I looked out, we were in a completely different place and he was giving me a creepy smirk. So basically I was kidnapped. 
I was sobbing and begging him to let me go and stuff but the crying felt so real..I think I almost realized it was not real life.
I decided to jump out and saw 911 and messaged my friend that I was kidnapped, and to come to the 911 lane?? I don't know what this is, because in my country the number to call for the police is not even 911 😭
Then as he was trying to catch me, suddenly I landed in the police station. A random girl comes to me and pulls me by my hand, and we run out together..randomly I realized I was in China..?? There's like some scenes of me exploring China with my family.
We jump to the opposite lane with a huge banner on which ""INFERTILE"" was written. The creep lost intrest and left, ig that meant that I turned infertile by jumping into the infertile lane and I wasn't of use anymore,, whatever this was 😭😭
Then I cried so much, again it felt so real it was crazy. I saw the girl looking sad for me. Suddenly it starts raining. I saw a man there that looked like the driver that harassed me..
I get ptsd ig? I run down a set of stairs and slip and fall and bleed like crazy, but the weird thing here is, it felt like I purposefully slipped down the stairs to bleed out 😵‍💫

Now that I'm writing this, I feel it was not a crazy dream but just one with a course of weird incidences that made me wake up disoriented.
Anyone knows how to get rid of these weird, exhausting and long dreams..I feel they start as I go into deep sleep and end when i wake up, it's like playing the role of a unlucky character in a long, slow movie.",2024-05-11 13:14:13

I don't know the significance of AL. I'm nkt from Alabama amd have only driven through the state. I don't know anybody with those initials either.

Any ideas?

I had another dream the same night.

171,Dreams,"Everytime I think of my childhood before bed I have nightmares, why?","For context I grew up in a constant state full of domestic violence, alcoholic parents, then turned older siblings. Just always fights. Hated even going home on the weekend from school 

Anyways, I read a quote in a book yesterday stating to “think about the wildest dreams you had as a little girl” and after deep thought, closing my eyes and trying to reminisce… I never had visions of a future, I never had dreams or goals. Not until I was about 14/16. Ready to work and started envisioning all the things I could want for myself.

I thought back to when I was a child &amp; realized, I was too engulfed in the fear and feelings of everyone around me that I truly never thought for myself. If you asked my siblings to describe me when I was younger they would maybe say quiet and cold hearted bc I acted like I didn’t care, but deep down it’s all I cared about. 

The only thing I ever knew and wished for as a kid was a pet penguin lol 
Like really 
So much so I never had a thought of the future, goals for a career, let alone college , none of my siblings (I have 6) graduated highschool so I didn’t expect myself to make it this far. 

Like literally though everytime I think back to when I was a kid before bed I end up having crazy chaotic nightmares that make no sense and then I’m tired af the next day


I did have a therapist months ago we were doing EDMR I think it’s called, therapy. Where u relive bad memories, that helped for a bit until it didn’t. 

I can’t afford therapy right now but has this happened to anyone else and what should I do to solve this and just connect to the little girl in me without thinking about any of the trauma she endured ?",2024-05-11 12:37:19

174,Dreams,Bad dream but not a scary nightmare ,"Ok so at first I was on a hike, I found a rag doll and apparently it could bring people back to life, I used it on some girl I think, apparently she was important to me but she just turned into a zombie and was hostile, I think I trained her to be otherwise tho. Then I was at a family party or something, my nephew had recently lost his legs (he’s 8 right now) and was disabled but still managed to play and stuff, then I think he got ran over and died. (Not COMPLETELY sure how but he died) I was grieving and stuff yk then it skipped to me skipping class with Elizabeth (I’m friendly with her rn but don’t really like her and used to have beef with her) we found Marylin’s (classmate) phone, and basically tried to find her, her class or her locker to give it to her, eventually we did and then I had to do some parkour climbing  **** to get back to class.
Then I was at home and my roommate was being an **** again and said the N word multiple times (he’s white white) so I basically told him to **** himself

175,Dreams,Fishing dream recurring. ,"So maybe since last year I have been having fishing as a recurring theme in my dreams. 

At minimum it is me in a store looking for a fishing rod. Or I am walking around outside with a fishing rod. But oftentimes I am at a body of water, usually a very small river or a canal or something and trying to find a place to fish. 


Context: I used to fish a lot when I was younger. Between the ages of 10-18. I am now 30 and haven’t fished since. I’ve lived all my life next to the ocean. 

The river and canal scenes make sense cause we used to go to a tiny swimming hole with friends in my early 20s. And when I fished as a kid the closest place to me was a narrow marsh river that also had tiny canals running under rail bridges. 

My best guess as to why fishing is because I’m a very anxious person and lately have had a lot of stress. So maybe fishing is my brain telling me to find a quiet and relaxing activity where I can be alone and decompress. 

I’m also trying to find a new career. So maybe it’s related to that. 

I do think I should take up fishing again. Maybe the answer is really that simple. ",2024-05-11 12:25:36
176,Dreams,Recurring witchcraft on my family dream ,"These dreams are about 2 months apart. I had the second dream last night.

First dream:

I was in my house with my family. We hear phone calls on the home phone and we hear people chanting in Latin or Spanish (I don’t remember). We then hear the doorbell ring, but we don’t answer because we know they’re outside. A few minutes later we open the door and they left a box full of objects on the doorstep. We open it and it looks like they’re trying to bribe us to become a part of them? Something like that. I just remember there being weird items in the box. We’re obviously freaked out and that’s about all I remember for the first dream.

Second dream: 

My family and I were outside on this yard which was pretty dark. It was just outside our home I believe. We start hearing these horn sounds and these witches seem to summon. I can’t see them, but I know they’re there. They seem to cast some kind of ritual where my family and I blacked out for a few seconds. When we wake up, I notice some symbols marked on my thighs. One of the symbols was surrounded by crescent moons in a circle. I think some of the symbols were coloured in red/black. I don’t remember the other ones. Another one of my family members also had a few symbols on his/her thighs (I don’t remember who it was). That’s all I remember for the second dream.

What are my dreams trying to tell me?

Thank you in advance for the help!

177,Dreams,Paranormal type dream???,"I have no idea what going on in this dream or what it could mean but I’ll get to it 

Basically I was at this building/house 
One part of it was a room like a place where you could ride scooters around anyways it was my cousin and a couple others and we were riding on the scooters after a bit
 I go in the next room living room type (which now thinking about it , it looked similar to the living room we live in now the only difference is instead of a window to my right (as I sitting on my couch) it was two big sliding glass doors ) and my two toddlers are there . My youngest has marks on him( deep cuts) and there is a fork as I pick this fork up and I just knew something eerie was going on and I’m looking at my son and explaining to my partner we prolly need to leave bc it just didn’t FEEL right or safe as I’m holding this fork and it quickly bends in different directions ( picture like one of those movies where the girl like her bones like turn in the way that they’re not supposed to like that but like a fork doing it like the pointy parts of the fork like that was doing weird ****) at the same time that happened
 I hear  A LOUD HIGH PITCH NOISE like for about 3ish seconds I’d say idk but I wake up .

Now in real life loud noises scare the **** out of me it hurt my ears and just brings panic to my body! 

Also I feel very strongly when I dream emotions and feelings are very intense and I also feel them once I wake up and they were there I felt like it was a warning of something . Either I was not suppose to be in that home . I have no idea. 

Anyways at that point I woke the **** and calm myself down telling myself it’s safe but also thinking what does this mean??

Idk maybe it’s nothing but I feel like it’s something . ",2024-05-11 11:48:37

180,Dreams,I need help.. ,"For the past nearly 10 years I've had the same recurring nightmare with minor deviations.

It starts with me waking up, I look around to assess my surroundings. Which leads to me getting up and realizing there's no one around. This leads me to getting out of bed, showering, changing, then leaving the house. 

Once I near the door, I hear my sibling either laughing or crying. Sometimes both, as I turn around, all 4 of my siblings are in front of me, looking at me in a strange demented way.

 As I ask how to help them, they all smile and begin attacking me, I fight them off, for some reason favoring killing them to incapacitating them.going from breaking their necks, to stabbing my arm through their throats, I feel.. scared.. 

As I go through this, if I win, I end up facing off against my parents, then their siblings, then my friends. If I die I wake up, not screaming but in sleep paralysis. Occasionally the dream just restarts instead of waking me. 

I've stopped sleeping. My body is terrified. My mind races when I get tired, my heart pounds so hard I can't breath.



 I'm sorry if this breaks community guidelines. I've just been up so long all the weeks are blurring together. I can't work, I can barely keep a social life and even my cats are starting to suffer.. ",2024-05-11 11:18:18

182,Dreams,Dreaming I was bear,"I had a dream I was a grizzly bear running through snowy woods towards the river. I felt powerful, snapping through branches and sticks. I was aware that I was a bear and could change back at will. Once I got to the snowy river bank, I noticed bones and skulls of other animals buried in the dirt and snow. I was crushing the bones and drinking the marrow. I remember not feeling vulnerable in such an open space which felt relieving. I knew there was no other predator that could dare to stand against me. During that I noticed lights towards the woods, so I ran towards it thinking it must be people. I didn't want to scare them, so I turned back into a human. They were looking for a spot to set up camp. I told them by the river was a nice spot, but to be careful. I told them there was a bear roaming around there before running off. And that was that... 
I woke up feeling good. It felt good to be in a place that would make me fearful, but then to realize I had nothing to be afraid of, because I was a bear. Now I just want to know what it all means.

187,Dreams,I can't get this dream out of my head.,"I never dream I usually have one or two dreams at most every few months for the past seventeen years but the past week I've had back to back dreams and all of them were just random **** stuff like turning into a flying dog or running around a city but the dream i had today just shook me and I can't stop thinking about it. It begun with me and my family on a boat sailing towards a island. We were in the inside of the boat that had a kitchen a hallway and a wall seat/dining area. There was another family in the boat with us and by how my mom interacted with them I would assume they were some kind of family friends. One of the people in this family a girl, presumably their daughter had no face. To be precise her face was entirely blurred she had a dress on long brown hair and pale skin but when I stared into her face it was blurred. I can't remember much but eventually when we got to the island I and her started walking into a forest. We held hands and talked for a while, i don't remember what we talked about but as we were walking back to the boat i just casually said ""Will you marry me?"" She turned towards me and said these words that still linger in my mind. ""When I turn eighteen sure, then we can **** ourselves together"" her face was still blurred but the way it moved clearly showed me she had a huge smile on her face. After that we went back to the boat and nothing interesting really happened eventually I woke up and only after 5 minutes of laying in bed was I able to process whatever the **** was going on in that dream. It's now 5pm I've been able to do nothing productive. All I keep thinking about is her. Who is she, Why did she say that and what is my Brain trying to tell me / process.

This was mostly just to vent since if I told this dream to my friends or family they would probably be worried but any insight into what all this could mean would be appreciated , thanks for reading this dream im going to go back to pondering what this dream was.",2024-05-11 10:23:19
188,Dreams,Some Avatar type stuff…,"Hello, so this morning I was dreaming it was me and a friend of mine’s girlfriend… just hear me out. Her and I were at my job (that I work at in real life). As I can remember things started to get **** between us in the office then trucks that I do paperwork work for as they come through started to flow in so we started working and then kept tryna get it on in the office when it wasn’t so busy.

Well one of the times when we had some downtime I was on top of her in the office and we were about to finally get it in. Then we heard some trucks show up outside there was a couple so we knew we’d be busy. As I was getting off of her to start checking in trucks I started fading out (waking up) when I opened my eyes in real life I closed them quickly to get back to the dream. I entered the dream for another couple seconds. She was standing in front of me almost in shock like she knew I was gonna leave because I was waking up in real life and she yells, “Wait No, Don’t Wake Up” which then I woke up in real life. 

Does this mean something? Is it possible we both were dreaming of the same thing and she knew I was fading out because I was waking up before her?
It was kinda odd that she would yell that too me and seem so aware like she knew what was happening.

Side note another weird dream I’ve never told anyone. Years ago I had a dream of this girl I had a huge crush on when I was a kid. I was in a bedroom of a house that I’ve never seen before and there was a tv set up with the screen on weird static black and white. I look over at the bedroom door and the girl I knew and had a crush on a long time ago came in rubbing her belly and it was obvious she was pregnant. That’s all I remember since it was so long ago maybe like 6 years ago (I’m 24). Well she ended up being pregnant soon after in real life as I found out from her social media. Which I didn’t even know she was gonna be pregnant cuz we live in different states and don’t keep in touch anymore. When she had the baby. He’s about 5-6 now I believe. The kid looks almost just like me and I’ve never seen any post of her with a dude that resembles the kid in any way. Almost like as if the dream was some weird way saying I impregnated her through the dream. I don’t believe she knows who the father is but then again I never asked cuz that would just be weird…

All these dreams remind me of the movie avatar like when they go in the sleep chamber thing and wake up as an avatar and live a different life like that. I’m convinced the dream world is the same we fall asleep and dream but the dream can still have consequences to what’s real.",2024-05-11 10:18:10

192,Dreams,I dreamt of being brutally murdered by a maniac pshycopath,"first of all, the dream took place in a pool in a building so I think we might have been stuck here playing this game with that pshyco path. the game is basically asking questions like ""name anime characters from sword art online"" or some **** like that. so each game had a judge that check if your answers are correct from the internet mostly. that maniac his name was jevaun or jevin and it might be my conscious because it sounds a lot like Kevin which is someone I heard his name a lot past couple of days but regardless if the judge didn't seem to be sure of his resources or didn't please the maniac he would get brutally murdered but first he could try to correct himself or convince the maniac for like 5 minutes or something. and these arent part of the game's rules, its just what he did. so this happens to 1 or 2 people before me and I see them getting their heads bashed in the pool's walls and sometimes their teeth because the walls arent that high from the water. and it happened to a really nice guy too and what I remember for some reason is that he looked a lot like cinnomantoast ken's friend (sorry I don't watch them a lot) but he had a full beared and hair, looked like an adult huge man (the guy that died). sometimes when I would get accused or something I would snitch because really I wasn't the judge and I don't want to take the blame but one time someone points at me and says it was me but now that I remember. it really wasn't me because the questions and answers were totally unfamiliar but regardless. i scram the internet looking for his answers and he claims he said this and that one. which where ones written on the pages but they had no points or values. i was looking for a +2 or +5. the values they are worth because each answer give different points. but it was all blank. he was starting to get mad and I try to reason with him telling him. this website is wrong, let me look at other websites and I scram some more until he grabs my head from the back of it and I beg ""please don't **** me"" and I close my eyes, I could feel my head and teeth not each tooth but my whole teeth or jaw being hit really hard and getting dislocated inside of my mouth like my teeth gum is pushed inside there and I felt blood and water going in my mouth and in my head I was thinking that this is finally it. i was sort of relieved that I am finally dying because in the real world I am somewhat depressed and suicidal. i had my eyes closed the whole time and I could feel and taste everything but I knew that whatever he did to me. i would never be able to survive it so I was relieved again that I am not surviving with disabilities or surviving at all. i just wanted it all to end. a couple minutes into this, I didn't feel like I was dying or my soul fading away. it felt suspucios and that's when I woke up.

I should mention that I didn't feel pain but rather everything else happening or maybe it was pain but I would imagine getting hit really hard in your front teeth that they dislocate is very painful. if you wanna know how that sort of feel like just line your fingers together and hit your frontal upper teeth with your nails slightly. and just imagine it being something much more faster and harder to. but for your gums or jaw to getting dislocated, I wouldn't really be able to describe it. whoever says you cant feel anything in your dreams has to be lying because I literally felt like I got brutally murdered in another life, I feel like I legit experienced **** and death in another life and its wild. I wouldn't say he's lying but some dreams and very rarely, you can feel everything (happened other times before).

sorry for the terrible punctuation, English is not my first language. i tried looking online for what it meant and the furthest I got was that being murdered in your dream shows the hopelessness in your current life and stuff like that. but IMO it wasn't getting murdered, it was sort of a russian roulette sick game with a maniac pshycopath

193,Dreams,What's been your wildest dream?,"I just had the craziest dream and want to share and hear everyone else's as they're usually hilarious.

Mine was almost like I was watching a movie in my own head but from the perspective of a man in his mid 30s (I looked like a real rugged bradley cooper) for context, this was weird as I'm a 22yo female lol

In short, all the audio I was hearing in my dream was actually from the games my boyfriend was playing while I was sleeping, my brain just somehow made its own script to run with.

For anyone that wants to hear the dream:

I was walking through the city about to go to my job when a helicopter randomly spun down and crashed from the sky right in front of me. Then all of a sudden a heap of people on the street started turning into zombies, going crazy.

I started running up into this building and we boarded all the doors shut and then started talking to all the other survivors there, and a lot of them were military so they obviously knew something was up beforehand.

I soon met the head of the military team (and the shock i had when this guy walked through the door). It was **** Keanu reeves and he was wanting me to join him on a rescue mission.

Before we get much conversation, the zombies slowly start getting into the building somehow so we all go to the roof and devise an escape plan. 

For some reason, there's an old bus up there that still runs, but doesn't have a lot of juice left in it. We quickly board up all the windows and doors of the bus with whatever materials we could find and then someone sacrifices themselves to use the crane to drop us on the ground so we can all escape on the last train heading out of the city.

We get taken to the ground by the crane, and the zombies are going crazy on the door and then some **** **** and her kid decide, last minute, that she just wants to die and doesn't have what it takes to survive. We don't have time to talk her out of it so we hide her behind the door of the bus with a walkie talkie, so she will be shielded from the hoard breaking down the door and can leave when the coast is clear. 

We then quiclly start to exit the bus by the back window, when all of a sudden, the door busted open and all the fkn zombies started sprinting towards us.

I narrowly escape, and sprinting my **** off and just manage to jump onto the train when we hear over our walkie talkies, the **** **** with her kid, saying that she wanted to die by the zombies, ""not like this""

We look out the window of the train and see this giant fkn grizzly bear crawling into the window of the bus and grabbing them from behind the door and mauling them to death and we just stood there hearing it on the radio lol

My dream ends as the train is riding us out into the distance, hopefully to a place where we can catch out breath and stay safe from whatever is happening.",2024-05-11 09:24:45
194,Dreams,"So, I had this weird dream about colorful music.","I was in a apartment building in the middle of the night (because that’s apparently where I lived in the dream but I didn’t actually live there irl) and I saw outside my window, a big little stage with touch activated lights, which is the best way I can explain it. I went outside to explore, and I only knew that it was touch activated because I stepped on it and touched the lights on the floor and wall of the stage. I had a fun time, just running, singing songs I liked (which existed irl) and making colors. I had a playlist of the songs that I sung during my fun time, and the playlist was a hour long. I was told by my mom that the stage was so long because Messi was gonna run on it. I usually have dreams about video games, but this was different.

195,Dreams,Dreamt I raped my (nonexistent) daughter. WTF.,"I often have reoccurring dreams about being ****, attacked, etc. But this is a whole new level.

In my dream I was a man (I'm 22F), maybe my father or something (can't quite remember) and I had a daughter, and I molested her in the shower. I remember feeling aroused. It was really disgusting to wake up to.

In real life I obviously do not have any thoughts towards children and I would die before I touched a child. But I don't understand how I could dream something so horrible and feel aroused, unconcious or not.

Edit: thank you for the responses, I'm a bit relieved (maybe wrong word) I'm not the only one who has messed up dreams. I have experienced SA/ sleep **** and a bit of abuse, hence the other annoying dreams but this was just very new and disturbing.

197,Dreams,I had this dream five months ago and it's still baffling me,"For context, I've had insomnia for years and it was getting really bad, one night I had a mini breakdown and finally slept 8+ hours, then I had this dream:

I was my thirteen year-old self, spending the weekend with my father who I hadn't seen in a while. But my thoughts were fully inhabiting my 13 year old mind. Like I remembered stuff I hadn't thought about in years, and the way I thought about my father was VERY much from my child self's memories so far. The way I felt about him was drastically different then. 

This is the main thing that stuck with me that's not normal for my dreams. Usually I ""play"" my dream characters, floating in and out of people's perspectives. But here I was in my own body the entire time. 

What happened wasn't that important, me and my sisters just toured a property he was managing, then he drove us across the state to go stay on a commune with his friends. And then someone got executed in the end, but it was all normal. 

The vibe in this dream was the weird part. Everyone I met in this dream made direct eye contact with me, and I could see their distinct personalities and social awkwardness. 

Throughout the first half, I was convinced that I had done all of this before, like deja vu, it felt like a memory I had forgotten that was suddenly all coming back to me. 

I felt like I wasn't in on the plot. Normally in my dreams I have some vague sense of why things are happening, a dream logic. This dream took me along for the ride, and it was only later that I was able to recognize how it had all been consistent. Like for days I was confused why I wasn't the one driving the car, I'm never a passenger in my dreams. Then I realized if I was myself at 13, I would probably dream I was the passenger. 

But the strangest part is after the dream I slept normally every night for three weeks. No insomnia, no circadian issues. It makes me wonder if this is what my dreams are like with the proper sleep rhythm.",2024-05-11 09:00:08
198,Dreams,Dreaming about publick transport,"I would say about 85% of my dreams are about publick transport. 5% is me walking/using the tram or driving in a city or town that I know very well, but is suddenly utterly alien or seems like an alternative reality version of themselves, strangely though, i'm never unnerved by it. 5% is about old abandoned houses and the rest is about anything else.

The dreams always start out with me on the bus, never waiting for it, and I have no idea where I am going, but i'm always relaxed and confident that I am heading in the right direction.

The routes the busses take are always unnecessarily convoluted and take me way out in the boonies, forcing me to get off and wait for a connecting bus which will take me to my desired location. I always make it on to the connecting bus, but thats where my dream ends. The dreams are very lonely, its mostly just me on the bus, if there are other passangers, theyre irrelevant shadows in the background. The bus drives does exist however in a short, entirely functional interaction when I step aboard the secondth bus and validate my ticket, never anything wrong.

The previously mentioned bus dreams are the most common form of publick transport dream, but I also dream a lot about being confused by nonsensical bus routes and suddenly appearing train lines. Like a direct high speed train line from a village nearby my town going to Iceland, which apparently has existed for years, and I'm the only person who has never heard about it.

I think the bus dreams have their origin in a job I had on a farm last year, april to july. I would have to take a convoluted bus route that would take, including waiting at the bus stop for 30 minutes for the connecting bus, 1.5 hours for what would have been a 15 minute drive. Worth noting is that the only time I remember getting off of the secondth bus, I arrived at an alternative reality version of that farm.

What I find very weird about this is first off how common these dreams are and how late they started appearing. In January of this year.

I have no anxieties or bad experiences when it comes to publick transport, which I only do occasionally, especially after getting a car in October.",2024-05-11 08:55:24
199,Dreams,I need help interpreting a strange dream I had last night.,"I dreamt that my dog, a female American Bully, surprisingly gave birth out of nowhere. For some reason we left her in a baby crib with a human baby in there. Her fur, especially her face, were covered in blood and she looked as though she was dead. I asked my mom how many babies she had, and she said 5. When I counted there were only 2, meaning that my dog ate her 3 of her babies. I remember feeling that I should move the human baby away from my dog, but I just left it there. This is all that I remember.

I frequently have dreams that have gore. For example, I've had one where I was trapped in a small room and the walls started bleeding, or one where everyone I touched turned into a mass of flesh and guts, but this dream unsettled me even more so than all the other ones.",2024-05-11 08:50:39

My dreams get absolutely insane due to my antidepressants but what really solidified having the weirdest and most disturbing  dream of all time was dreaming that I was having **** with the family dog.

You heard me right. 

I woke up feeling disgusting, ashamed, confused. I feel ill. I’d never do such a horrific thing and I’m certainly not one of those freaks attracted to animals. I love and care for animals and I’d NEVER do anything like that. What does this mean? Why did my brain do this to me, I feel so disgusting. I honestly feel horrid.

Then i went and googled dream about food on a grill (more focused on the grill). I read it only to see this as a part of what the dream could have meant and saw this;

To dream of grilled food (such as a cooked breakfast), sausages, bacon or beef can imply that you may need to incorporate some colorful fruits and veggies, healthy proteins like nuts and lean meats, and drinking fruit juice or more water into your daily routine. This is a dream about  nourishing your body and with the right nutrients, you'll likely notice increased energy levels and improved overall health",2024-05-11 08:10:25

It was like famous Pietà but instead of Mary holding Jesus, Jesus was holding Mary. I tried to walk around the sculpture, but Jesus was looking at me all the time. Then, he started crying blood.

I tried to search something similar but there's nothing like reverse Pietà. I only saw one sculpture of Mary that started crying blood. Have you ever heard of something similar? I want to know from where my brain took that strange dream.",2024-05-11 08:03:39
205,Dreams,"dad almost kills me in dream, and mom pretends to no care. What is the meaning ","I’ve never reached out to reddit but i feel like i need to talk and need some advice over a dream I just had.

I went to sleep around 2am after playing a night of games with my friends. Me and one friend were talking about school and i mention my dad’s past business and what he does now. He tells me that i Should listen and let him guide me since it seems like he knows what he’s doing. i completely agree and then go on with my night. This was the only time that my dad was brought up during my whole day prior to the dream.

When i go to sleep i dreamt of my dad but a skinnier version slightly, **** a loved one idk which one but i can still recall. And then i caught on some suspicious activity and then he realized that I know it was him. he holds a gun to my head and says he’s gonna ship me off to hong kong but after i frantically tell him i wont snitch or tell anyone, he lets me go. My mom usually comes home around 8:30 pm and when i was frantically telling my dad we were in the living room. After my plead i hear laughing behind me and it’s my mom around the corner that has heard my dad killed someone. I run over to her but she scurries back to the garage and back in pretending like nothing happened and then I woke up

If someone please tell me the meaning of this. My dad has never done anything. I love him and trust him with my life, same thing with my mom",2024-05-11 07:49:23

207,Dreams,Bizarre dream about being an investigative reporter(?) on an extremely wealthy likely  incestuous family ,"This is probably one of the most vivd dreams I've had in a while. So first I'm in the car with my mom going to the doctor, I'm in the Dr office for like 30 sec before he says I'm fine and we leave. Then she drives for a long time out to the middle of nowhere and stops at a house and just drops me off. The house is massive like size of the white house and on an insane amount of land, no one around just complete privacy. I wonder around a bit and the adult children of some rich ex actor maybe mafia guy who owns the house. All the kids are 20 something and super weird, as you would expect from top 1% wealthy homeschoolesld secluded people. 

The sister leads me to her room which looks practically unchanged since the 70s/80s lots of **** grandma ish patterns and little glass trinkets all on a shelf. She leads me outside where some of her other siblings are sitting on some tables in the grass. It's never mentioned but like yk how dreams just imply things sometimes, it was implied that they have a very.....close...sibling relationship. They all Sar around in this circle of benches outside in the very private estate, probably like 5 siblings. I was very weirded out but didn't say anything because they were rich enough to have me killed in a second. 

I sit there for a while and look around until I turn to my side and on the other benches there's just a **** ton of redheads. Like multiple redheaded large families just appeared one for every race but all redheads. I made particular note of the asian family that all kinda looked like Devon Aoki. 

Fast forward now the wife(?) Of the head guy is throwing a party for him and she's just perfectly fine with me being there. There's some scene of me trying to **** bc I had to irl but that's nothing special. In the bathroom I am given a headphones and microphone set up by the woman for some reason. The party is about to start and we begin talking. I start telling her of a dream i had about the redheads (in the same dream??) And before she can say anymore the party has started and we all move outside. 

The party was filled with people all white and rich, very Easter themed kinda. I still have the headset on and she asks me to like report the things I see that are weird and so I do and talk to her more about the dream thing. Until eventually the like main guy notifies me and the headphones and takes them away and questions who I am ans what I am doing. I get kinda spooked after this and shut up. Then everyone goes inside and I can't find my shoes so some little girl steals someone else's for me and then I wake up.

208,Dreams,Visited a weird place. ,"So in my dream I was in search for a place I’ve visited before to show my friend in my dream. I noticed dark stairs leading to a room with a rope indicating the area was closed.  Someone who worked in the “lobby” directed me to run in a different direction. As I ran I’d get **** into new rooms and my outfit would change ( I couldn’t see the rooms I was running into just myself mostly) then I heard a voice tell me to hurry, run back and hit the desk bell in the lobby to return before I get lost in the loop I was currently in. So I did. Once I range the bell the man in the lobby said “ my boss told me you’d like to visit “ The Room” he then moved the rope and I walked in. At first glance the room was small, there was a bed and one peace of decor being a ceramic pregnancy belly. As I walked in more I noticed a bathroom with a long tub and another small nursery room. Once I stepped into the room my dream then felt EXTREMELY real. I was there. As I started to walk more I noticed there were no mirrors except tiny ones placed too high for me to see myself ( something told me it’s best not to try) and no windows. Barely any light and everything was the same yellowish color even the furniture which was just the bed and nursery. The same color was one the walls ceiling the floor even the tub. I also notice layers of paint caked on the walls. The room felt nice until I walked in more I started to feel uneasy and wanted to leave immediately. Before I could open the door everything went black and I heard the looby man say “ I was told you wanted to leave The room “ then I heard a loud dog bark which scared me physically and paralyzed my body I then had to shake myself awake. Thoughts ? Has anyone else been into “The room” ? Or something similar with a different room ? ",2024-05-11 07:25:09
209,Dreams,why do i keep dreaming of cheating?,"I am in a relationship that i’m mainly happy in, it’s medium distance and we see each other once a week, we have ups and downs but i’m mainly happy. 
i often have dreams of being with other men, celebrities that i find attractive aswell as male friends in my life. 
Last night particularly i had a dream where a male friend came round my house (this is someone who i do spend time with because of my work) and i knew he liked me and kept making subtle moves but i was consistently feeling really guilty and telling him im not going to cheat even though i kind of already was by having around and we were chilling in my bed. i don’t have feelings towards this male friend and i love my boyfriend, so why do i keep having dreams like this? it’s really concerning to me and i feel like this shouldn’t be happening. 

Psa. I would absolutely never cheat on my boyfriend, if i’m in a relationship i’m loyal and i would never want to do that. ",2024-05-11 07:04:29
210,Dreams,"The people, their deaths, now the sun ","A while back, when i was a kid in kindergarten, i had dreams, one at a time, about each of my family members dying. I loved all of them but i had dreams about them dying. 

My mom and i was walking around this place filled with people and at some point they were gone all of a sudden, it was just me and her. Some dumb slime thing was chasing me and my mom, it wasnt moving but praying. I went to church and rhe nun was from some cult and ended, i woke up, realized it was a dream then went back to sleep. I was a princess of Egypt and my mom for some odd reason was jealous and told my people to **** her and hang her on the cross and burn her and they did just that. This was when i was really young. In kindergarten 

My next dream after i was my sleep demon, i was in 1st grade but it was a dream about my dad, there was a few cars from the fbi and my dad was running but he ran off screen of my veiw and they kept shooting him, nonstop. I dont know why i was having these dreams at this point. It probably was the movies my family watched around me

My grandma, and older cousins, i just killed them in my dream, i wasnt even mad at them, i lived with my cousins too so i dont even understand that dream. I love my cousins lol

At this point, i started getting more vivd dreams, and i was a teen, my neck would feel like it was actually getting cut, or my a hand would cover my mouth and i actually couldnt breathe, or there was a rope actually around my neck. One was my little sister falling into water, my mom didnt care, she kept watching tv as i tried to save my lil sister from the weird hole in the house filled with water. Of course she wasnt responsive when i pulled her out even if she was in there for only a few seconds

Then i went to boot camp, after that, after so long of being okay with my dreams, boot camp nightmares haunted me back to back. It was the idea of going back and aaiting to go home, going through the process, feeling trapped, etc. 

Though, i am somewhat of a lucid dreamer, alot of these dreams are manage able, i realize its a bad dream and i could just relax, leave the dream, and nothing comes out of it. Like this one dream about screaming snails and freddy fazbear killing snails scared me a lil amd i left the room he was in without him seeing me. Then the very next room, there were more killing snails and lurking for people to ****, or snails. I just left the dream. Such a dumb dream but normally i realize its a dream, i wake up, or change the dream. It was fine

But now n days, my dreams are just about the sun. This partly came from when i was younger. My aunt made me sit down because me and my cousins were being too loud but i got punished for it. While she was asleep for hours, the channel was on science, where i lesrned that the sun would and could explode, taking us all with it since were close to the sun. Of course i had a nughtmare about it once and moved on. Now, these dreams of the sun come back every so often. Maybe like every other week, and if its not the sun its about bombs but at least with dreams of seeking shelter from bombs, is that its not about the sun. Though its the sirens, the sirens set me off. 

The sun exploding always has me in awe, and in fear and it keeps coming back. I have no idea why it started now, but i might as well continue since i find myself looking at the sky everytime the sun is dipping, when the sky is orange it scares me. A hard day at work only to realize youre dying soon and everything youve done to try. To enjoy life, to enjoy yoour life the way you want to enjoy it was good while it lasted but its too bitter to swallow. And these dreams are playing games with me. It'll always seem like a normal dream. a weird good dream about playing games or being a person inside a game or seeing new friends ive made. This dream recently was about shopping after a long day, then becoming a video game character while talking to friends. As me and my boyfriend walk out of our apartment, we hear sirens, then we see the sun just explode then the all lights from the sun go out. Just one of the many dreams that started to appear. I dont know what it all means but im starting to fear the sun a lil, because its a very realistic reality later in the future. I hope in gone when it happens and im at another planet flying around with a healthy sun or theres somwthing byond death. A ****, heaven, something. I hope.",2024-05-11 07:02:38
211,Dreams,I keep having the same event happening in my dreams but in different settings,"Hello, if I’m on the wrong subreddit, please let me know and if possible, tag the correct subreddit please.

So the for the past few days I’ve been having dreams about having a good time with a girl and then suddenly she takes off running. I’ll go through a maze of doors in a house and once I catch up to her, we have a sweet moment because we’ve reconnected. Then she does it again. It’s like a never ending game. 

I’m starting to think that it’s possibly something trying to tell me about my current romantic relationship. My gf and I have been together for almost 6 months. It’s her first relationship and my longest. She’s been very emotionally unavailable in the past but she’s starting to open up. Although it’s a slow progression, it’s progress nonetheless. The girl in my dream kind of resembles her with her big brown eyes and similar figure. I think it’s something telling me that no matter how far she tries to push herself away from me, keep going after her. I mean I’ve been doing that for years. I just kind of want someone who doesn’t know me to tell me what their possible interpretation of my dream might be.",2024-05-11 06:40:03
212,Dreams,Hallucinations in dreams,"I've always been a person that dreams a lot and almost always remembers the dreams when I wake up. Sleep paralysis is not foreign to me and something I have to deal with.

But this night brought back memories and I'm curious if anyone experiences the same. Can't google what it is lol

When I was a teenager and out with friends I would almost always hallucinate when I went to bed later that night. I would feel like I was still with my friends but that I was sleeping in the middle of everything. I would see them, hear them and feel them. This went away when I started to drink. I think I become so **** that I just pass out.
But last night I went out without drinking and it happened again. It feels so weird and uncomfortable.

Every night you point in a grid map where do you feel your dream was, regarding ""home"". He says that sometimes these dreamers compare maps and notes about locations.

I tought that this is intriguing, but I cant find on internet people speaking about their maps and comparing them. I would love to see that.

Later in the dream, I was working as a waitress (or something like that), discussing interdimensional travelling with my coworkers. And they said you shouldn't do it, because you never know what might happen. So I concluded that interdimensional travelling had turned my grandfather into a zombie.

I also keep dreaming of this specific pool it’s like a wave pool. (Also possibly Vegas related) haha

216,Dreams,“Anxiety” Dreams?,"I never knew how stressful and anxiety inducing my dreams were until I started insomnia meds. I don’t know what to call them dreams other than anxiety dreams and wonder if others on here have struggled with them as I have?

Years I’ve struggled to fall and stay asleep. For hours and hours every night my body would fight against sleeping. Then when I did sleep i would say a good half of the time I woke up mid sleep talking or yelling out loud, covered in sweat, tied up in my blankets and with a racing heart and palpitations. Some dreams were bad and stressful some I just never recalled dreaming that night.

FF to now being on meds for a good year. Some weekends I skip my sleep meds because I stay up late and I don’t want to take them at like midnight and then be asleep till almost noon or super groggy and **** feeling waking up with the meds still at a strong force. When I skip them it’s always, ALWAYS a stressful dream. On the meds I don’t remember dreaming. Off the meds it’s always intense. Someone from my childhood yelling or beating me. Me sometimes yelling (out loud) back. I wake up sweaty, elevated heart rates and high anxiety feeling to where I can’t fall back asleep. I’m grateful for the meds, but **** ya’ll literally sleep like babies, like all the time naturally? I didn’t really know how good and rest filled it felt to sleep without dreaming on a regular basis before the meds, sure I had some fine nights here and there but not weeks on end like this now with the meds. But, I just find it crazy that when I skip the meds on occasion for a late weekend that my body reverts back to that trauma and anxiety.

I'm 25, so most of my growth stopped happening 5 
years ago. In my dream last night though, my whole body grew at an abnormally fast rate. Every time my mum looked at me, my limbs looked longer. The growth was extremely fast, a bit uncomfortable and caused bleeding.

In the dream, there's no suggestion that I was experiencing puberty again. I still felt 25 years old.

I've read a couple of interpretations which suggest I'm about to undergo a period of transformation/growth in terms of my situation, knowledge/wisdom and maybe wealth? The interpretations were more related to someone who's shedding skin and growing into a new body though.

The dreams are always incredibly vivid and I can remember every detail when I wake but I can't figure out what they mean. Usually I just assume it's unresolved feelings and try to let it pass but I have been sporadically plagued with dreams of her for about 3 years now (usually between the months of May-Sep) and every time I do, I get that same inexplicable pulling feeling, like I should call or text her and try to talk things out.

I couldn't move and it felt a little difficult to breath.",2024-05-11 02:10:11
230,Dreams,What does this dream mean? ,So I’ve been having really weird dreams. I am a physic medium very very sensitive and most entities and warning come through my dreams. But I had a dream the other night I’m gonna start logging them on this so I can see what y’all think. It was me and I had two twin daughters that were identical and I crashed my car in the ocean near some island and my daughters actually were evil tried to **** me and I became way more powerful they took me to this kingdom in the water and after I showed them my serpent self in the dream they bowed and showed more respect .And they ended up getting took from me and I was left alone with nothing. I woke up hyperventilating crying for my daughters It was very short very weird. ANY THOUGHTS!?  I know it’s kind of **** but I was thinking **** too haha. ,2024-05-11 02:06:47
231,Dreams,black and white,"today i had my first black and white dream (or at least the forst one i remember). **** it was so unnerving, i was kinda relieved when i woke up. 

at first i was walking on a field behind my house and a jeep pulled over. man and a women were sitting in it. then the car dissolved or something and suddenly they were sitting on the ground. i didn't know them, there were yapping about some documents. a woman appeared behind them and hit the man in the head with the back of the knife, i thought it didn't do much harm, but he kinda died. i looked in the woman's terried eyes and turned around. my neighbor was running in our direction with an axe?! it was for real my neighbor and in my dream the woman who hit the man with a knife, was my neighbor's wife?? in real life he doesn't have a wife so it was weird. once i saw the axe i ran for my life and didn't look back, i don't know if the neighbor's wife got attacked. 

i came back to my backyard and told people what happened, but don't remember how they reacted. wind was blowing really strongly and i peeked into the hen coop. in there two of my youngest siblings were sitting on the floor and looking at a window where pure white light was coming from. possibly the weirdest part of the dream was when i noticed the crows sitting at the window sill and the floating hands in white gloves in front on them. they were signing. they were using sign language and whispering and my siblings were watching them as if they understood everything. for some reason while i was dreaming i wasn't scared of the hands, they seemed logical to me, i was just scared of the whispers",2024-05-11 02:05:47
232,Dreams,Fell in love in my dream,"So yeah, yesterday morning I woke up with strange emptiness inside my heart because I fell in love with a girl and got attached to her in my dream. Not gonna tell the actual dream cause it's a little complex to write but all the feelings were real and mutual. Whenever I was talking with her, I could feel my heart is becoming heavy and I could feel the happiest I was having. So, when I woke up, I was sad with little pain in my chest. It's been more than a day and I still can't get over her :/",2024-05-11 02:02:43
233,Dreams,dream about missing Death,"So I just woke up from this dream/nightmare and I felt like sharing it, suppose as a form of therapy lol. If anyone can interpret it that would be great, if not then at least I shared it with someone. Possible trigger warning for mentions of death and suicide thoughts.


The dream started with a group of 4 teenagers or young people around that age, who were driving a car. A police car with sirens, which tried to stop them for speeding and driving away, emerged from the left at nd tried to stop them, but failed and instead drove into a field where it caught on fire. The teens stopped and went to see it. In the dream I saw burned carcasses in the burning car. One of the teens snapped a picture and then they all drove off on bikes. The girl who snapped the pic was the narrator in this scene and she said something along the lines ""I have fond memories to this day. It doesn't matter what happened, at least we were all together"".
I, who was watching this part in a tv as if I was watching a show or a film, made a snarky comment about how ""When talking about being on a crime scene, you should never say you all were together"". :|

The next part I was actively one of the teens. We were in some kind of house, presumably doing cosplay of Disney princesses as they were in dresses and kept calling each other ""Belle"" or ""Mulan"". The Mulan girl was in her room finishing her look when her phone started to ring, so me and the Belle girl went to the living room to give her some privacy. I remember glancing to rooms that were pitch dark, one of them being the Mulan girl's room, and being really uneasy. Anyway, in the living room the Belle girl showed me pictures on her phone of the various cosplays they did, one that stuck to me was where one of the girl was tied to a chair and nervously smiling as another girl was standing behind the chair with only her head visible.
Afterwards the Mulan girl came into the room crying and one of us asked her who it was on the phone. She said ""It was Death. He said he misses me. But that's not true, you miss him! You, you, you!"" she screamed while pointing at me.


Next I woke up, I swear I could still hear the 'you's in my ear for a second there. I was so scared even to open my eyes for a while. I like horror and usually laugh after realizing it was all just a nightmare, but this one really left me uneasy, even now as I'm writing it. I think a good chunk of why this made me so uneasy is that I struggled with suicide thoughts in the past, so that whole line really struck me as a lightning. But either way, I just felt like sharing it might bring me some eaze. And if there might be some symbolism or meaning that I missed I will gladly hear more about it.",2024-05-11 01:57:10
234,Dreams,Can / can't you read in your dreams? Interpretations welcome,"**Curious if anyone has been able to read in their dreams?**   
**Or what happens when you try to?** 

I'm not a lucid dreamer, I do have vivid dreams and while I've never been able to make out the words, people react weirdly. Here are two of mine (feel free to skip) 

**Dream #1** - newer dream 

I walked into the living room and my entire family was there talking amongst themselves. I sat where I usually do but there was a book on the arm of the couch and I didn't want to touch it because I was afraid there were bugs in the pages. My dad said he had got it for me, I said thanks but that I couldn't read it and told him why. He said it there weren't any bugs so I picked it up and opened it to read. 

It wasn't written in words but tiny faint symbols, I flicked through and all the pages were like this. I was very upset, someone asked what's wrong and I said, 'There are no words!' All the chatter in the room stopped, everyone went silent and I realized they were staring at me. My dad looked angry asked what I meant, I said the pages are blank and showed him but he started saying I wasn't making sense. Then I started to feel angry because I couldn't understand why he would even buy the book, so we got into a whole argument over that 

**Dream #2** - older dream (sorry it's a bit long) 

I was in a team, there were monoliths dotted all over outside, we had to touch them so they'd power up and glow. I'd just arrived, everyone ran past me to where a few monoliths were in a row. Another team appeared, when they'd touch the monoliths they'd glow a different colour, so they were kind of battling. I just stood there watching, then I thought, 'Wait... why are we doing this?' I never said this out loud but it was like they all heard me 

Everyone stopped what they were doing, like it didn't matter anymore, when they'd walk past me to leave they all gave me this angry look, like I'd ruined the fun. I didn't know what was going on so I just followed my team after they left. We came to a 'museum' that looked like an abandoned parade, there were these big wooden puppets but they were very rudimentary, there were little plaques in front of them and I lingered behind trying to read them

The others walked off and an older woman walked over to me. She seemed friendly and asked where I was going, I said I didn't know and kept trying to read the plaques but she kept trying to get me to move on and follow my friends, even saying the museum was closed, I could tell from her voice she was getting fed up. I asked her why I couldn't read the plaques, she said there were no words (there were). She said, 'Why don't you follow your friends,' more gruffly. I said, 'It doesn't matter what I do, it's a dream.'

A storm formed around her and she transformed into a witch hovering in the air, then there was a loud creaking from above and we both looked up, one of the large puppets fell forward, slumping over like a jack in the box, it had one big red eye that unnervingly stared down at me - then I woke up",2024-05-11 01:40:24
235,Dreams,A DREAMT LIFE: Where dreams and reality merge.,"I am a man of faith and have documented how **** has communicated with me, mainly through my dreams. I am sharing the tagline and intro of my book, A Dreamt Life, to provide a glimpse into our complex relationship.

*‘In a dream, **** threatened to put me in jail.*   
*But we worked it out. It was a case of mistaken identity.’* 

I was in **my** dorm room alone that night when I heard the voice. I jumped out of my sleep and looked around to **make sure** I was alone. I was drenched in sweat and badly shaken, trying to figure out what had happened. Amidst the confusion, for some unknown reason, I cried out, “****!” Then, as if I knew it was Him, I questioned why He would threaten me—like that. 

I had a dream before this one that concerned me. It was visually horrifying, and the message was disturbingly clear; despite that the **drug** deal was too good to turn down. But, this second dream **terrified** me, I had never been so frightened in **all** my life. Unlike my other dreams, there were no visual images. Everything was pitch **black**. I could only hear a stern voice. I was **in my early twenties and would remember every word spoken for the rest of my life.**

Exhausted from the ordeal, I eventually went back to sleep. But, when I woke up the next day, I was a reformed man. My life had changed overnight. **It took several months, before I removed myself from all criminal activity, ended toxic relationships, and transferred to a new school. However, this time I was focused on a new mission and never looked back.**

237,Dreams,Cheating on my partner dreams,"I (20M) have been having dreams about cheating on my gf of just over a year (20F) for the past few months. Any indication on what this means?

Had one this morning, where I was getting a handy off of a family friends daughter, who I've kissed before way before my current relationship. The dream was weird, as if I had fallen asleep during my dream and woken up panicked within the dream about cheating etc.

The dream the night before I was cheating with one of my ex's, who I have no contact with and haven't seen for years. But that dream was full blown and I didn't even feel guilty during my dream.

I have a lot of stress atm due to university deadlines for assignments, not sure if Im trying to alleviate it through weird **** dreams but they're almost never with my actual partner.

I have **** dreams a lot but they used to be about me and my partner and now they're not, wondering if its due to a lack of **** with my partner in recent months?

I never usually think much on dreams after I wake up and usually cant remember them within the hour after waking, but these are really vivid and it leads me into thinking about them for the rest of the day, just wondered if anyone else had any experiences to share or give opinions on because I don't really have anyone else to talk to about it lol.",2024-05-11 01:13:12

Afterwards a man showed up (i think he was from a zoo in the dream) to talk to my family and i about it, however I dont really remember all the details he said as i was too busy with the giraffe. it was an overall peaceful dream but very strange.

244,Dreams,"My last night dream that sounds like a movie (you won’t regret reading it, hopefully)","so the world is filled with abnormalities, like zombies, magic, demons, and of course humans. We all live together trying to survive. But it’s not as chaotic as people would depict it, people still do their daily activities, like working, hanging out and stuff. 

Long story short, I work in a group to eliminate whatever the clients want. It’s a high paying job in that kind of world and I needed money. So we received a quest to investigate this cult? that is VERY popular among teenagers and younger people, they even talk about it in social media. They say it’s super fun, you’ll forget about anything that stresses your mind. After that, my group and I went to the town going through creatures and humans till we find a small building with a big sign (don’t know what is it called, but I remember the writings are written in a weird red font). So many young people went inside and they were so hype about the party. The room is transparent from outside, there are 2 curving staircases on the side that lead to the stage. Finally, we decided to enter and pretend like we’re just a teenager wanted to have fun. They were a few people that seem to be leader of the group. They asked us the religion that we believe in. We answered with a random religion and they smiled, letting us in.

Then the party started, the leaders are on the stage and the party music came in. People are dancing, but slowly, my friends are starting to get in too character. They look like they forgot about the mission, and totally enjoy the party. Everything started to get weird as the party seems more like something that leads to a **** party. My friends that are a bit more far away to me have seem to lost it, now I can only rely on two of my friends near me that I’m dancing with. For context, I’m a girl and the other two are also girls. Then one of them started to lose her mind and try to get on to me. So I quietly ask help from the other girl (my bsf) to help get her off me. She was quite religious in her faith, so I believe that she won’t get the influence. But then, she looks confused and ended up trying to get on me too, instead of helping. Now, I don’t wanna start a commotion and blew up our cover in front of the leaders. The leaders already seem to get suspicious on me as I’m still looking quite normal. So I pretended to go along with my friends that I even fake kissing and touch my female friend :"" (FYI: I’m completely straight).

Turns out there are rounds in this party dance. The second round is filled with few people that the leaders choose. Most of my friends have been going on the side so the effect is not as big as before, but they still look kinda high. Only me and my two female friends, and few other people left in the middle to dance. And so, I pretended further and hope that the leaders don’t notice but I think they figure it out. Now my top priority is to get my friends out instead of investigating further, because no one is in their right mind. My other friends have waited outside of the room, now my job is to bring my two friends out forcefully. 

At the end, I managed to do it without creating too much commotions. And we decided to go back to to the streets late at night and go back to our base. I carry one of my friends while the others are walking and stumbling, kinda look ****.

We walk pretty far away and I look back making sure they’re not following. The street looks empty and quiet so I was relieved. But the second I look forward to the street, I heard a quick running steps and one my friends got stabbed. That stranger and his friends continue to **** some of my friends quick and turns out, they come from the cult. Anyway that is that, I got surprised wanting for revenge but I woke up.

Sorry for the bad grammar and hope you enjoyed it &lt;3

One of the people in this group of designers is my friend from school, and he kept correcting me while I was designing this 'bench.' This caused me to flip out and tear the whole thing in half. I barely ever remember my dreams, so this is really funny to me.

249,Dreams,Dream about Childhood Friend,"This is a journal entry from a month or two ago that I wanted to share and see if anyone had some insight.

Okay, so i had this dream probably around four weeks ago at this point. I can still remember the majority of it clearly. I don’t know what it means, if anything, but I want to write it down. 
I can't remember exactly how it started, but I know that I was in school again and I was preparing for an overnight field trip. We were in this building and the guy that i think is the principle tells me that i will be sleeping in bed #1. I go along with it, but i can tell that i am apprehensive about it. So all of these beds are in a suuuper long hallway. A lot of the beds are lined up along the wall, but some of them are in rooms without doors in the hallway. Also, the beds are only on the left side of the hallway. There are just doors on the right. So i'm maybe between halfway and three-quarters of the way down the hallway. I've been scoping out everyone else's beds and the rooms that are more like hotel rooms and just wondering why i had to be so accommodating and agree with bed #1. Suddenly, there are double-doors on my right that lead to this reception area for what looks like either a hospital or therapy. I meet this woman who already knows my name somehow and we just chat a little bit before i leave to finally find my bed. Well, i end up finding the bed. At this end of the hallway, the lights are hanging by a strand. Some are flickering. The bed is next to an exit door that looks super creepy with an exit sign that is also flickering. On the right side of the hallway, just across from my bed, there is a door that leads to a long, sloping, winding hallway. Somehow i know that there are terrible things that happen down that hallway. Anyways, i see all this and i book it in the opposite direction. I run into the woman from before in the same place and shes totally nonchalant about the uber-creepy ****-hole looking end of the hallway i just left. I leave her and just start flying down the hallway, through the lobby of the building which now looks like a school on the inside, and down the hallway that is straight-ahead for me, but would be to the right if you were coming in from the entrance. This is definitely a school now, because there are lockers. Anyway, apparently i see someone i know because i yell, “Adam!” (pseudonym) and launch myself into this guys arms. “Adam” turns out to be a guy who i knew in elementary school. He grabs me and the dream ends with me being completely draped over him and it feeling completely safe and warm.

This was not the end of me dreaming about Adam, however. 
After having this dream, I could not stop thinking about Adam. I ended up finding him on Twitter and finding out that he goes to a local college about an hour and a half from me. 
This is where things get a little more weird, though. I am a religious person and believe that some dreams are given by **** and can have significant meaning. That dream felt like that to me. I have also had several more dreams about Adam since then. 
This includes a dream I had two nights ago.
Before going to sleep, I prayed and kind of just thought, ""God, if Adam and I are going to see each other again, please give me a dream about him.""
(This wasn't the first time I had prayed this and I was given a dream about Adam the last time as well, but I wanted to make sure.)
In this dream, I was driving around in a busy city. I ended up in a restaurant surrounded by people that I was friends with in the dream, but not irl. Then I saw Adam. Even though he has grown a beard, I recognized him instantly. We spent the majority of the rest of my dream catching up.

Here's the thing, though. I don't know if I want to fully believe that the dreams are from **** and/or that I am going to see Adam again. I don't know if I'm just doubting or what. I guess a part of me is scared because it seems that he is doing some great things in life, whereas I've struggled through my teen years and feel way behind as far as growing into adulthood goes. I also have no idea if he even remembers me or not...

Anyways, interpretation and advice would be greatly appreciated! Thank you ❤️",2024-05-10 22:33:35
250,Dreams,Had a nightmare about getting murdered in a house and now I’m moving into a house,"For context, I’ve known I was going to move from my apartment for a few months. About a month ago, I had a nightmare that I moved into an apartment and there were bugs everywhere.  A few nights later, I had a nightmare I moved into a house and someone tried to **** me. 

It made me very nervous and since my roommates and I were looking for all options (house, apartment, townhouse, etc.) for our move, I felt in my subconscious I should try to avoid looking at houses and only look at apartments. I let my other roommates still look at all options and never told them about this dream cause obviously it’d be ridiculous to stop looking at houses due to one nightmare. 

The other day, we ended up finding an amazing place that just so happened to be a house. I had forgotten about my nightmare and was so excited about the house but last night after we signed the lease, I remembered that nightmare. The house doesn’t look anything like the one in my dream, and I’m a very anxious person so I know this could come across as paranoia. 

Is anyone good at dream meanings? I really just need someone to tell me I’m being crazy and that everything will be fine lol ",2024-05-10 22:18:18
251,Dreams,I had a dream that I think has a deep meaning and I need someone to help me interpret that,"So I’ll try to explain it as good as I can.

I don’t remember how it starts, I feel like someone told me to go to the shopping mall for something or either I felt like it.
I had around $2 on me and I was just pointlessly walking from shop to shop it was also empty, I don’t remember seeing anyone there. 
I got out and followed some kind of plain/mountain path. It started to rain, it was a light rain. Later on I found a can of an energy drink and I was pretty happy about it. I feel like I wanted to show it to someone. After walking a bit more I realized it had a hole in it and so I lost everything that was inside. 
The further I walked the rain got heavier.
I reached something, some kind of another shopping mall but more like open? There were lots of people, even thousands, but I noticed my girlfriend. She stood there with her arms open. I don’t remember if I hugged her or not, but I remember that I felt lighter on my soul. 

Then we were walking around, can’t tell if it was still raining or not- 
But we found some kind of a bakery that had HUGE croissants on display, I wanted one really bad. But then I got a call from my friend and wole up :p

253,Dreams,A nightmare with a nice ending ,"Day 38. We were at a grocery store, and trying to fit in with the infected so we could purchase some food. Someone got infected; it was a heavyset lady. She was like “aw ****”. 

Then we sneaked back in at night to take as much as we could for our survival. I remember flying inside the grocery store to get a better look. 

We met another group; they were also scavengers. 

Then cut to one of the girls in that group, she was sitting on a 90 degree door step outside a home. I remember seeing her from the left, but it was only a perspective. She had green hair and white knee high socks. She was eating a Lotte Choco Pie with two more stuffed in her back pocket. I used to love eating those as well. A zombie came in from the distance and bit her, or me, because I was her. I became an infected, and tumbled into the house and the door closed.

Later on her friends came home, they were terrified about to **** her. Then I somehow managed to explain with hand signals that a zombie bit me, but I still love them as my friends. They seemed relieved. 

I can’t remember the rest of my dream.

257,Dreams,Same being in different peoples dreams,"From my early in my childhood, as long as I have been dreaming until around 11 years old I had recurring nightmares. They would take place in different scenarios and environments but each nightmare had one thing in common.

There was some sort of creature that would almost ""infiltrate"" dreams even if they were normal and not nightmarish. It was thin, had a large vertical oval shaped head, striped, colored black and blue usually, and would move so fast you could not see, as if it were teleporting.

I would sometimes see it off in the distance. I became filled with dread because I knew it was coming to get me. When it would get me, it would ""take me away"" as I would say, but I don't know where to. I would feel this aggressive tickling in my ribs. It did not feel good. It was horrifying and made me feel powerless. It felt like 10 hands prodding me with their fingers in super speed.

When I became old enough to truly describe my dreams, my mother told me the same thing was in her dreams as a child, and would appear in a recurring dream she would have too.

Fast forward to today and I was watching a video on a thing called ceremonial clowns. I read the comment section and found someone describing an extremely similar being that was striped and would teleport and do terrible things to him or her. They compared it to the monster from nickelodeon monsters. This makes me think it was thin too like mine.

I'm wondering if anyone else has had similar experiences. The thing in my dreams had a strange name. I will share if anyone is interested.

  
Side notes:

It would come through electronics like TV screens or computer monitors from time to time. 

To protect myself from the ""tickling"" I would do a fetal position and put my hands together under my head pretending I was sleeping. It would still take me but it would be painless.",2024-05-10 19:56:25
258,Dreams,Does anyone know what this means,"I'm writing a book based off these dreams because the are so odd
Basically I was a young girl, not me.
Everyone around her would die an extremely gruesome death in all the dreams. She would be the only one reacting, everyone else was stone faced.
In the last dream I had she just watched someone be cut in half, she was freaking out and someone came up behind her and took her. She was told she would be their daughter, they are the only people that didn't die around her. She was caught trying to contact someone on a digital camera? And the people came up and I think killed her but I woke up. I haven't dreamed about her since. I want to know what these dreams could possibly mean so there is a meaning for my story",2024-05-10 19:46:19
259,Dreams,I had super coincidental dreams about current events,"For a long time but very rare, I'd have dreams that felt different than other dreams. Then within a short time, they came true. I always tried to rationalize it, but they kept getting even more specific. 

Two years ago... I had a dream about Russia invading, A power plant on fire, the northern lights being seen in the south and a nuke wiping out a population. At least two weeks later Russia invaded Ukraine. Months after that my friend who lived in Puerto Rico informed me their power plant was on fire and power was down. Putin put Russia on nuclear high alert. Now the northern lights. 

I really hope the nuke part of the dream was just that and the tension between NATO and Putin... and not anything more. 

I don't think about it most of the time and I don't believe in psychics. But when I do think about these dreams, it feels weird.",2024-05-10 19:33:05
260,Dreams,Apartments,I have a recurring dream where I live in an apartment but I have to go through many other apartments to get to mine. Often I get lost and can’t determine the difference from one apartment to the next except maybe I’ll think the pink carpet looks familiar. The apartments are a string that go many street blocks and I have to start at one end and move through one after the other looking for mine. Ok Reddit do what you do. ,2024-05-10 19:28:32
261,Dreams,Dream Segments,"I had a lot of dreams today. Several segments of them

In the first dream, I was in a classroom. Across the room, I saw my partner. He raised a waterbottle up to his face, covering one of his eyes. He had drank the water. That was a cue from my brain to hydrate when I wake up. So I did, which usually causes me lucid and vivid dreams. There was probably more drinks/water there. I was paying more attention to him, though. It seemed like a message I had to decode.

After I woke up and took barely a few sips of water, I dreamt of being online, looking at pictures of me. I saw photos of me from an alternate universe. They had been sent through facebook messenger. I was outfront, standing in the sun. In the yard. That's what I can remember. I woke up, wanting them to be real. I hate when I dream of stuff like this. Being online in my dreams makes me forget everything also.

In my next dream, I was crying about my dad. I was upstairs, commenting about how I've been *'dead inside'* and *'broken'* since 2014. Talking to my mom after seeing a episode of uncle grandpa randomly, took me back mentally.

Sometimes I dream that it's 2012 to 2013 roughly, taking place at my sister's old/boyfriend's house, or seeing my niece and little brothers younger. My brain takes it trauma out on me this way, showing me how/keeping me stuck and regressed; I am.

I then had a dream I was sitting ontop of a tall building, in front of a open window. Looking down at the cars and people. A cat was sitting next to me, telepathically trying to lead me away from it.

Body and soul by love and rockets was playing. I wanted to hear the song over the imagery I was seeing.

A quote from layne staley about his cat popped into my head, about how she was his love. He spoke of her like she was a human. *'She was my little - love?'*

I went into a older building, going down the creepy staircase. A box with **** deftones songs was to my right, one track had eminem on it. I then transitioned to my house, leaving the few girls that were leading me into the basement. I now sat in front of my tv, seeing a playstation 2 game playing on the screen. It started off with a generic word and had 3 added to it. I wanted to use my mom's phone to take pictures outside, annoyed with my brother because he was touching the phone. There were a couple phones set down on the table, one I recognized from earlier. It had a wishbone shaped button, blue and glowing. Y2K style. I ran outside with it, forgetting to take my makeup with me. I used the last of my elf lipstick, breaking it off accidentally. I used a paper towel to smudge it on my lips. My mascara, I don't think I used. I looked into a vintage vanity that was set up outside, wooden. It was starting to get dark and I was restless, not wanting my mom to take her phone back or leave with my little brother. The neighbors had pulled in/parked a big truck outside, which I noticed when I walked back around outfront. The girlfriend of the guy next door laughed/giggled when she saw me dancing.

Bad trash by switchblade symphony was playing. I was spinning, twirling, excited by a good song playing on the radio for once. I remembered the beginning of the song starting off in a rap song that always threw me off because I thought it was this. I didn't like the rap song. That ripped off the band by stealing the instrumental. This doesn't exist in reality.

The sky was getting darker, as I was wasting time by spinning. My lipstick looked dark in the mirror, my forehead looked textured/wrinkly from the stress. There was a spot on my forehead that was. One of my cats was watching me. I woke up, not long as the song was playing. It went straight into party in the usa by miley cyrus, immediately.",2024-05-10 18:25:37
262,Dreams,Reoccurring dream surrounding my mother,"Since a young child I’ve had this dream where I’m in the yard of my grandparents house and my mother is outside as well and it’s pitch black outside and she’s chasing me around as if she’s a monster and she looks kinda like one too, and she keeps screaming my name and my grandparents won’t let me inside. I’ve only had this dream about 9 times in my life and the last time I had it was around 6 years ago but all of a sudden I dreamt of it again a few days ago. Do you think there could be meaning to it?",2024-05-10 18:23:08
263,Dreams,Best dream I've ever had,"It's late in the afternoon, and I'm on my way home from some sort of trip. I get off the bus early and start walking up the road. An officer greets me and offers to walk me home. We play around for a bit, chasing each other, but eventually start walking. Strange, but fun. One of his friends from the neighborhood joins us. [*Magic City*](https://youtu.be/zPJi6jxJlik) from the game *SimCity 3000* begins to play and we all remain silent. We get to the top of the road we're on and begin climbing a tall, root-covered cliff face. Blue, glowing mushrooms adorn the stone along with some green moss. We make it to the top and advance along thick-rooted earth until we come to a gazebo that overlooks the land. A dense suburban area covered with trees can be seen down below. The sun is setting, giving the sky a yellow-purple hue. We gaze in awe. The officer phrases his wonder with one word, ""Wow."" The dream ends.

Woke up crying. Wasn't sad, though.",2024-05-10 17:45:10

265,Dreams,Lucid Dreaming Guided Meditation,"Hey everyone! I’d like to share a project I’ve been working on — a guided lucid dreaming meditation I’ve developed called the WILD Cup Technique. 

I've included binaural beats in the background to enhance the meditation experience, starting with alpha waves and transitioning to theta waves as the session progresses. I’d love to hear what you think! 

Check out the video here ([https://youtu.be/2ApwNf87uI0](https://youtu.be/2ApwNf87uI0)) and let me know your thoughts. Do you find the binaural beats helpful? Or would you prefer a version without them? Also, I’m really curious to hear your thoughts on  the WILD Cup technique itself. ",2024-05-10 17:39:32
266,Dreams,I found design documents for an interesting game in my dream,"Just found this sub, and it reminded me of a old dream I had Autumn of last year.  
I went into a used bookstore to find something to read. I proceed to find a old-looking book with design documents for a multiplayer game named “Sensarift (temp. title). I read some of it to find a really interesting game. I then woke up and wrote 5 pages of stuff into my notes app. The next morning I read through the stuff. Here’s the summary I wrote that day:

“The game revolves around 2 characters the ""Sound Composer"" and ""Emotion Guide"" who solve puzzles in a 3d environment. the emotion guide has abilities to affect the emotion of the stage and objects , while the sound composer manipulates the soundwaves produced by other objects and creates them themselves. Players communicate via gestures, the most vital being the map. This lets players mark certain parts of the stage.

There are also a few single and two player campaigns available.“

If anyone wants more I’ll fish it out from the pits of the notes app, though some of it I rewrote later as I found it hard to read/controls mentioned were insufferable.",2024-05-10 17:36:55
267,Dreams,Discovering things about real life in dreams?,"I once dreamt that I went to another version of my house. The house looked similar to how it was in real life but the furniture was a bit different. Anyways, I woke up in the kitchen and went to check the time. And when I looked at the clock on my stove and microwave they both had the time in 24 hour format. With the time saying something like 19:17 and 13:15 on the respective appliances. But when I woke up in real life the appliances had always been in 12 hour format so I tried to turn it to 24 hour format and lo and behold, it was actually able to do it on both appliances without me knowing but only having discovered it in a dream. Has something like this ever happened to you where you discover something about real life in a dream?",2024-05-10 17:30:37
268,Dreams,"Had this dream when I was a kid where the Easter Bunny, about 6ft tall, looked very malevolent and evil and was staring in my window lol. A friend of mine that was over was especially terrified and was screaming off the top of his lungs.

269,Dreams,Living through my dreams ,"I live vicariously through my dreams. Wherever we go when we fall asleep is when I feel truly alive. No matter how scary few of them might be, I feel aliveee. My dreams are always more adventurous. Spontaneous. Sensual. Romanticized. Happier. Exciting. I get to do the things and experience the things that I can’t in my awake life. My “awake” life is going pretty well. I have it pretty good. For now I get to be a sahm (to my 2 cats and 1 dog) and I live where I always wanted to live. My relationship is pretty good. I have basically everything I always wanted. However, things are just more “rich” I guess.. In my dreams? I don’t know. Life  is just that much better there. What if dreams really are us in a different dimension? It’s like  we’re living totally different lives than we do now but we’re still “us”… I atleast feel that the me in my dreams is still very much myself. About 6-8 months ago I got on Venlafaxine and my dreams are way more realistic and I have multiple a night. Going to sleep is always an adventure. I will never pass up a nap or early nights sleep.

270,Dreams,"I never dream, yet i dreamed her","Title says it, i literally never dream. Cant remember i ever dreamed anything at all in at least 5 years. But last night i dreamed her, and also like 3 weeks ago. I dont remember anymore what dream had included nor what was i doing in it... 
We have never ever meet in person (and its also impossisible for at least several months - if i manage to get a lot more money somehow), and I have never felt this attraction towards someone. I have never gone after girls/women before nor wanted something  more. 

Is there any fella who ever been in same situation or experienced something similar or anything kinda related to mine I would most greatly appreciate your advice 🙏

271,Dreams,Chlorpromazine?,"Does anyone here have any experience or knowledge about the effects of Chlorpromazine/Thozarine on your brain while sleeping? 

Was having a hiccups problem for days because of Dexamethasone and my doctor prescribed me it. The two times I slept it felt like being transported to another dimension. Won't even try to explain the feeling but it was more real than any lucid dream. Never experienced anything like it before, very scary. ",2024-05-10 16:08:18
272,Dreams,so who else shares these locations?,"ive had many dreams involving a 'university' type setting. two different 'campuses' now. also, another location similar to a backrooms type of lacale, but its more like a movie theater lobby with many rooms and floors. ive graduated with the whole class behind myself, and thats why im now at the secondary campus. who else shares these sensations? very lucid dreams, very strong feeling of connection and familiarity within them. also, theres another location or two, they feel like houses, one is on a hill, another is in a lightly wooded area. i would assume nearby the, yet another location, campsite environment. all of which have been repeated and can visit them with full lucidity now.",2024-05-10 15:49:18
273,Dreams,Why did I have this dream?,"This is creeping me out. Basically, I had a dream I was in my neighborhood, walking my dog when another dog grabbed him in his mouth and shook him around. I got the dog off him after a minute, and my dog (Ollie, because I'm sick of saying dog) ran home (all bloody and stuff) I grabbed the dog, and smashed it against a wall over and over again (I'd NEVER do this in real life)

  
Also, this dream was before I got another dog, Chucky (In real life). Chucky looks like the dog in the dream. He's a sweetheart, and didn't fight back when he got too close to Ollie and Ollie bit him (He is small, and there was very little damage). 

My question is, why did I have such a violent dream??",2024-05-10 15:37:19
274,Dreams,Strange dream last night,"I had a really strange dream last night and I’m interested in others’ perspectives on what it may mean.  Feel free to ask me questions if you like.

In my dream I was heading into what was absolutely recognizable as my high school, but in my dream this was my college and I was running late.  My brother and I were in the same class and I knew that he was already there so I was trying to get to him and to class.

Along the way I ran into one of my favorite teachers from high school who was exiting the school with his kids.  We both smiled, greeted each other, I told him he was the man, fist bumped him and kept moving.  I got within a few doors of my classroom and somehow dumped all of the contents of my backpack out on the ground accidentally.  I tried to pick it all up, but kept dropping stuff.  An old friend who is no longer a friend because we fell out appeared and tried to help me start picking things up.

This went on for the whole dream.  He pulled out his phone, pulled up my wife’s Facebook page and was telling me that my wife posts the sexiest things.  For some reason this wasn’t weird to me, I wasn’t put off by this, smiled and agreed with him because I love my wife and fully agree that she’s hot AF.  I kept trying to pick **** up to no avail.

At some point I found a sheathed knife in my backpack and when I pulled it out I realized that it couldn’t hold an edge and the metal was curling.   This was more of a curiosity than a concern to me, as my main problem was all of my stuff all over the ground.  I started to get stressed out that I couldn’t pick up everything off the ground and that I was going to miss class and my brother, and then I woke up.

What do you think?",2024-05-10 15:29:06
275,Dreams,Weird dream , It felt like a normal day then when it was night time I saw a full moon and below it was a waxing Cresent. I still think about what that meant to this day. Does anyone know what that means?,2024-05-10 15:08:42
276,Dreams,Keep “waking up “ but it’s still a dream,"This happened over 25 yrs ago and it left such an impression that I can still remember it. It was Groundhog Day esque. I would stretch awake in my bed, go through my morning routine and go to my community college, same routes through hallways, same small talk with people, went about my day, went to sleep, wake up and it was the SAME DAY. I religiously used a Franklin Covey planner at the time, and I would open it to the same page with a Wait a minute, where are my check marks, this is supposed to be the weekend, what day is it, see the newspaper and it was what I thought was the previous day…this loop happened like 5 times. 

This was in the aftermath of a breakup     that was pushed by the father of the other person based on me not being the nationality of the other. This is a rejection I had never experienced before and made me feel inadequate and worthless and undeserving of love for the rest of my years. I was a leaky robot afterwards. 

Life continued to spiral out of control as my parents broke up months later.

My parent at home became more unhinged and disfigured my face because it looked like the parent that left. Oh, to clarify this was IRL. A living nightmare. 

The only dream part was the Russian doll dream in a dream in the first paragraph.

So back to that. What does it mean when you have a dream within a dream like that? 
Is it a parallel universe on hold ?
Nothing eventful happened in it.
Just a status quo, same old, routine.
Was it just to hang onto sanity? 
A sense of normalcy?
 Sorry so long

278,Dreams,"Dreams are becoming longer, more in-depth, and requiring way more consciousness than I like to give while sleeping. They are starting to feel like I have to baby sit a second reality!!","Hello,

This has been something that has been bothering me for the last year or so. My dreams are becoming longer, requiring more attention from me than I would like to give, and also are becoming burdensome. Its not impacting my physqiue, or health, its just how long they take now till I wake up, its ridiculous, it used to be instantaneous for me.

I dont have nightmares or terrors, theres no gore or violence, but, my dreams are becoming full-on mandatory, involuntary, additional reality experiences. I am appearing in my dreams as I do in literal reality, dealing with people and business all-dream-long, and they stretch on for so long, that, there are times where I literally avoid sleeping because of how much work I will end up having to do in a dream. I'll be at my computer and i'll look at my bed and the first thing I think about is how long this dream is gonna be, and if I try to avoid it its like trying to avoid work its something you know you have to do. It makes you really hate sleep, I don't wake up tired or drowsy, but its how long the dreams are that make me really feel like I can get a bit more stuff done before I clock out. 

I miss when sleep used to be instanteous for me. In and out. Now It feels like I have to clock in for work just to get a night sleep.",2024-05-10 14:44:39

The way it worked was that its molecular shape cleared all receptors for various inhibitors. It was quite similar to Narcan in both its usage and application. The method of application was spraying it three times on each nostril. Then some biohackers got ahold of this and started microdosing it for its neuroprotective properties.

281,Dreams,How do I stop having nightmares?,"Basically the title, but my nightmares are starting to get really bad. They usually happen in the morning, the recurring ones are:

-I get fired
-I do something to emotionally or financially destroy my parents
-I receive an eviction notice or am arrested for some white collar accidental crime I didn’t know about. 
-A lot of my dreams are based around random phone notifications as well. I’ll dream that I get some life-ending email or text or that my boss texts me telling me I am fired and ruined the project I’m working on. 

Sure, I do I have some credit card debt irl and was part of a mass lay off a few days ago. But, these nightmares have been ongoing for months before that and just feel so exaggerated. In reality, I was on great terms with my boss and coworkers, and the layoff wasn’t performance based. I’m not delinquent on my debt and not in any real life risk of financial ruin. I I have good savings and try to be responsible. I’m not a criminal, I have a good relationship with my family, etc. I am obviously job hunting now and am always working to reduce my debt and stress. But these nightmares are causing anxiety and I don’t feel I actually have enough problems on my life to warrant them. What can I do to get them to stop? Or at least stop remembering them? They make it tough to get up in the morning. ",2024-05-10 14:09:34

284,Dreams,Déjà vu in dreams ,"19F (sorry if this is long)
So this dream happened when I was maybe 15?
16? I still think about it a lot because it was odd but also cool. One night I dreamt I was running with someone, I don’t remember what we were running from. And it was a girl, when I think about her now, I can’t remember her face, I feel this feeling of kinda familiarity. At some point there’s this tree, it’s a big tree. Like insanely huge. It had a door, it kinda looked like a tree house but inside the tree (I hope that makes sense). We’re still running when I see this tree, it was intriguing to me. I turned my head and i thought, “I’ve seen that before…I seen it in another dream.” But it was a really quick thought because I was still running. I, then said it out loud so the person I was running with, I don’t remember exactly what she had said but I really really feel like she said something like, “it’s fine, don’t worry about it.” There were things that happened after that, I don’t remember. That’s the only part I remember. Has anyone else experienced this? Or does anyone have some type of insight on what it could mean? Now that I’ve written it, I guess it’s more of a lucid dream, because i remembered the tree from another dream, so I knew I was dreaming, but with déjà vu too.  ",2024-05-10 13:34:01
285,Dreams,Dream featuring someone who has passed,"Over a year ago, while staying at a hotel, I had a dream that featured my high school boyfriend who passed away many years ago. I hadn’t ever dreamed of him before, or since, no matter how hard I wished it. The dream was short, and of course with time I remember less, but I remember being on a helicopter pad for some reason and he was on the helicopter, reaching his hand out toward me. And that’s it. I remember feeling, hmm, peace. Not scared or sad. 

This dream kind of threw me back into the grief of him being gone. I felt guilty for having gone so long without thinking about him. I cried so much during this time, as if he had just passed. For a couple months after I would write to him in a journal every night, mostly to reminisce. 

For context, our high school did a Time Capsule sort of thing, well, not quite. Graduating seniors wrote letters to their future selves that the school would mail to us x amount of years later. At the time of writing our letters we were broken up, and he wrote his letter to me, addressed to me. At the time, I was upset that he would do that and I tore his envelope up and threw it away, that day we wrote them in school. I did not even read the letter before I discarded it so cruelly. 

The strange thing is, those letters were sent out and delivered a couple weeks after my dream. Suffice to say, the guilt compounded, and anger too. I was so angry at myself for doing that back then, and a part of me believed that he came to me in that dream because his letter was going to be delivered soon, should have been delivered soon. What I wouldn’t give now to know what he wrote….

I also feel like I robbed something from his family. For better or worse, they didn’t get a letter from him, the way it was intended. They still live in their family home and if he had followed instructions it would have been them receiving and reading his self addressed letter. 

I just wanted to share, this has been on my mind a lot lately, as his anniversary approaches.

286,Dreams,Cryptic message,"A couple nights ago I dreamt of an older man with a bushy white beard and worn out cloths, with slightly fading colors of red, bluish/green, a winter jacket and winter hat on, he almost looked as though he were homeless, he smiled as he said “Finding messages hidden in reality are greater than what they seem”. I then woke up and said “that sounds cryptic, I should write that down”.

288,Dreams,Blue being identical to me in lucid state,"One particular day I laid down for an afternoon nap in my room and upon falling asleep I instantly became lucid. When I opened my eyes in my dream, I was in the exact same position and location as in reality (I was on my back with my head at the foot of my bed) but there was a blue person that looked IDENTICAL to me, standing over me and looking at me curiously. In the moment I was terrified and screamed for it to leave me alone which I now regret because I didn’t sense anything malicious. I woke up immediately after feeling very calm which left me feeling more confused about my dream reaction. 

I have basically summed it up to fear of the unknown, but I’m curious if anyone has experienced anything like this before? 

Also, not sure if this is relevant, but I have been able to lucid dream basically my whole life, and about a week before this dream, I had successfully astral projected for the first time (that I have memory of). I was in my room, pushed myself out of my body but got very creeped out at seeing my body sleeping on the bed and decided to wake myself up. I have yet to try it again.",2024-05-10 13:05:52
289,Dreams,"Confronting dream ""people""","I often lucid dream, and when I do a lot of times I'll start telling the people around me that they are not real, that this is just a dream and none of it matters.  

Sometimes they listen, mostly they get aggressive, and some people swear they are real and tell me their names and where they live but I can never remember upon waking to actually try and connect with them irl.

291,Dreams,"Reoccurring location, not reoccurring dream","So im up in the woods at a camp that I work at every summer. It’s the weekend and we have nothing going on. There are some caves nearby. We have all of the caves explored. We have lights in all of the caves. It’s been deemed safe to explore. There’s one cave they have the lights off cause they’re fixing something. Well, in my other dreams, we have an area in it that there’s a rope you can hold on to and wall run in it. It’s like an obstacle course we made in the cave. So I was down there and I had a flashlight with me and it was fun. So I went back up and found someone to go with me. I forgot my flashlight so he turned his on. We were running to the spot cause it’s a long walk. He’s holding onto my shoulder as we run cause it’s dark. We heard a noise and thought it was someone messing with us. He turns his light and it’s a bear. It starts to attack and I wake up. 

So that’s the most recent one (like 10 minutes before I wrote this). All my dreams have had the same place and same people. But none of them have been a nightmare.

295,Dreams,Deceased Father Ages Before Me,"I had the weirdest and most uncomfortable dream last night and was hoping someone could provide commentary to help me process the meaning of this dream.

I am an accountant in my mid 30s with two children and live in another state than the one I grew up in. My father passed over 7 years ago.

Last night, I dreamed that I was at my childhood home with my children (current ages).

While at my childhood home, I saw the reflection of my father on a nearby glass door walking to the room that my children and I were in.  In the initial reflection, he appeared as I last remembered him, older. 

My father made it down the hall to the room that my children and I were in… he walked in the room appearing young and said “ I just wanted to check in and see how you all were doing.” My kids responded with “papa!” and proceeded to walk over to him.

Immediately following my father’s statement and before my children got close to him, my father began to age right before us. Literally age… his skin became older, he became heavy set and his hair changed Etc.

This was unsettling (while still dreaming) so we left the room and then I woke up immediately following the room departure. I woke at 2am on the dot.

I’m still trying to process this as it is a bit odd, random and unsettling.

Has anyone else experienced anything like this? Could there be some sort of meaning behind this?",2024-05-10 12:02:38
296,Dreams,My dead cat visited me in a dream,"Fluffybun (my 18 year old cat. I’m 23 now so I’ve had him for most of my life) visited me in a dream. I was with someone and we went somewhere. A door opened in front of me and out comes fluffybun. I immediately start sobbing and fall to my knees. I give him the biggest pets, hugs, and kisses. I rub his face and he’s purring. He was chunky again (his last year he got really skinny). For some reason I thought in the dream “this isn’t 2024, this is in 2022” believing that I’m thinking of a memory but I know it really wasn’t a memory. I got to love him for a little while before having to go (idk if I woke up or the dream had to progress) I kept reminding him that I love him and miss him with all of my being and I felt an understanding from him. I think he heard my message. He was giving me some closure.

After that I was on the way to work and realized it had been a month to the exact date (maybe even time) that he passed away. 

After almost making it to work, I was questioning if it was a sign or not. I just kept thinking “what if my brain subconsciously knew it was a month since he passed?” Right after thinking that, a car passed me on the left side with a realistic cat face/head air freshener (the custom ones you can get). I fully believe that was him wanting to give closure. 

After 2 weeks of his passing I stopped hoping he’d visited me. I asked every single day just for nothing to happen. I gave up and figured he’d show when he’s ready. Today was the day. Again, I didn’t even realize it had been a month, i stopped counting but i remembered he died Friday Morning and it was Friday morning. ",2024-05-10 11:58:34

5/3-Me and a guy I know we’re working on an ambulance together vaguely remember the ambulance but remember that I was a paramedic and he was an EMT
5/10 remember I was on a train track that everyone was walking on and was safe at first with arrows like a crosswalk that said walk then it suddenly became unsafe and we were running for our life and every time I put my hand on something for stability it began filling with black sand and moved a lady offered helped but angrily asked what am I doing on the tracks while she was in a vehicle that was turning the tracks to soil and offered me a ride to the next station station name and layout vaguely resembled the Chicago L network she then offered me a gift card that resembled a visa vanilla gift card which I then attempted to use to buy a transit pass however the only machine was in a fancy restaurant that was connected to the station and the gift card was for $25 dollars and when I put it in $85 popped out but then I looked at the money and the waitress said that the money was only good at the restaurant and the cheapest table required a $90 minimum however she then rudely said that a manager could exchange the money for cash. I then asked for a manager to which she rudely turned around and said I am the manager and then I woke up feeling hungover cause I had forgotten to take my anxiety meds yesterday and ran out.",2024-05-10 11:41:01

Anyways to the dreamzzz

The first dream a guy was coming to pick up my car for scrap, but when he arrives, he’s excavating and tearing apart the whole yard outside, and ripping apart all my cars, 

So I’m furious and tell him **** you, then he disappears, then I regret it, and feel an emptiness away from Jesus so I pray 

Second dream, I do laundry at a gas station, then I leave, and come back, the woman attendant yells at me, “we are closed!”

I’m startled but say, “thanks I needed that” 

And then I leave, but as I leave, the laundry is done, so I go back in and find, my clothes all over the floor, and women clothes

I put my clothes back in again and think of how easy it is to do laundry at my parents house instead",2024-05-10 11:26:02
299,Dreams,Dream Interpretation: Burning House &amp; Destroyed Identification documents,"
Hi, so I had a dream earlier this week and I’m not sure if there’s any meaning or these 2 dreams are related to one another. I could really use some help. By the way, I am Christian so I do try to pay attention to my dreams. 


I remember some parts of the 1st dream: 
I was in an unfamiliar building which was on fire. I remember being a couple stories high and there were old classmates with me I can’t remember. I can’t tell you how many or who was there. The window was shattered, the room was on fire, smoke and flames filled the air. My only escape was through the window. I jumped and looked towards the sky. When I got up, I needed to start life all over because all my document: ID, birth certificate, cash was burned up in that fire. Someway somehow though, even when I had no identification or nothing to my name, I was able to get a place to stay. 

The very next day I had this dream: 
I was chatting with an old childhood friend of mine and we had a scheduled to hang out that day. I remember driving home because I live with my mom and it was early in the morning in the dream before the sun came up. When I reached home, I took a nap on the couch I sleep on in waking life and woke up about 2 hours later in the dream. When I woke ip, I decided to go outside and I saw a large plane fly directly almost right over my head before turning 180 at the last minute and soaring away. Now, my mom was outside going through some old folders. She pulled out an old folder that had my documents like ID, birth certificate and everything, things of that nature! I told her to hold onto it and that I would be back. I walked the rest of the way to meet my friend since we lived right by my old library. 


P.S. I do not live next to an airport and me and my mom do not live near my old library, especially not within the short walking distance I took in my dream. I’m not sure if these 2 dreams mean anything but any insight would help.

I had these repeating dreams for about 2 years, where this ghoulish/wampireish whatever creature would stare at me in my dreams. The strange thing was that it would get closer and closer every time the dream repeated. Like it started outside on a tree about 2 years ago and the last one was +- 3 months ago, with it right above my bed.
At first I found these dreams scary (duh) but I gotten used to them over the 2 years, and tbh I konda miss them. It might be bicose I gabe the creature a name and ig developed a strange relationship to it? I dobt know.

305,Dreams,Recent dreams,"Hi all,


So two dream recently have made me wonder a lot so I’d figure I’d come in here.

First one was last night. Had a dream I was at a wards show-a big one but not fancy. I’m pretty sure the theatre looked more like a giant version of my high schools. For some reason sat next to Phoebe Waller-Bridge which is cool cuz it’s Phoebe. Few other random celebrities were there (I recall Ryan gosling but forget the others). But it was more like a celebration, nothing being awarded out just constant performances going into a full blown confetti canon celebration. I genuinely have no idea what this could mean. I haven’t really been celebrating anything lately? Idk


The other one though. On a moderation page I followed bird and bird feathers were mentioned as were various angel numbers. The other night I had a dream I was gardening in a house I’d never been in before (the gardening part makes sense as I started getting seeds and plants for the garden this season that night). All of a sudden a bird swooped in from behind and gently grazed my neck. I looked up for it and boom I woke up. The time on my clock was on of the Angel numbers. As you can see now you know why I’m very curious. 


Any insight would be greatly appreciated ",2024-05-10 09:08:46
306,Dreams,Roblox Game with a Creepy Secret,"(Idk if this is a nightmare) I played this Roblox game and it was like Greenville and Southwest Florida Beta, I found a shopping center with an Apple store, I went inside the store and saw only one table and the store looked empty, I found money on the table and saw a note saying, ""Please do not take the money!"" I stole the money and it was giving me so much money that my money amount was 100T, I don't even know how that happened but when that happened, a black figure appeared and I got so scared that I tried to leave the game quickly but I got teleported to another game and it was playing eerie music, It was dark and I was falling on an endless pit and a text saying ""WHY DID YOU STEAL THE MONEY, YOU WILL FALL ON THIS ENDLESS PIT, HAHA""

I'm watching 'Evil' and they mentioned the idea that you cant read in dreams.

310,Dreams,Dream interpretation? Flying on a stick and being chased by a woman who saw me and didn’t want me to fly,"I just woke up from this weird dream where I just took a metal stick that I could unfold and make very long with one click and then I sat on it and flew. In my dream, I knew sometimes I fell because I stopped believing. I fell again during the dream once. I decided to focus and that it was all in my mind. Suddenly I also realized I was trying to push my stick with my hips to go faster and I wasn’t going as fast as I wanted so I thought maybe I could even change the speed of my stick just with my mind. I tried it and it worked. It was difficult but if I really concentrated in going fast then the stick went fast as if I could control it with my mind. I was flying over the ocean, not that high but I had a great view of everything. Then I was also flying right above trees.trees and ocean. 

Suddenly I was at a house that seemed to be my fathers (btw I haven’t spoken to him in years because he’s a bad person) and there was a woman who then turned out to be a nurse and she saw my stick and that I was about to leave and fly and she looked at me annoyed and then tried to prevent me from leaving. She really tried to close the doors and stop me. She was watching me and chasing me. I finally was able to escape and fly away.

Third scene I was back in the same home. I knew there was a main nurse aside from that nurse and I told her about the incident. No one reacted. Then I was surrounded by like 4 people and I started practicing my lines about how I would tell the nurse who chased me that this was my family home and that she was no one to tell me not to do anything. While I practiced everyone had an expressionless face and dead eyes. No one reacted. I woke up.

What’s your interpretation?",2024-05-10 07:11:51
311,Dreams,Seeing someone has posted things on their socials but nothing there when I wake up,"I’ve had this dream multiple times in a row where someone had uploaded new posts on their social media. I could literally see exactly what they posted and it’s hard to remember now but I can still see some of the words in my head like a memory. I woke up because my heart was racing but in my dream I felt so much joy. 

I can understand having these dreams because subconsciously I want to see this person post on social media, but these dreams were so vivid and each post was different. Also the time frame is not matched to the present time all the time. 

For example, I had dreamt about them saving new pins on Pinterest. When I looked there was nothing there. That was the present so I brushed it off because it could be my fears/desires/anxieties.

However, last night I had dreamt about seeing a post on Reddit from them from 3 year ago. These posts are not always good or bad or directly about me and what I want so I don’t know how to interpret this. It feels so realistic. I can see their current usernames, usernames I haven’t seen before, and exactly what each post said and who was in it. It’s still a flash in my mind but it’s getting all jumbled when I try to recite it. Just feels like a memory of me seeing a post. ",2024-05-10 07:08:51

313,Dreams,Help! My ex's gf died in my dream and I wanna know what does that mean...,"Okay, so first off ik this is gonna be lengthy but if I need help I have to go into detail about my dream so that y'all can understand and help me interpret it...
The beginning of the dream was kinda weird, like my whole family (all of my relatives) were going to attend a wedding except my mom and me because we had no idea about it until we figured it out for ourselves and we dressed up and went to the venue... Turns out it was my cousin sister's wedding (she actually got married last year) but after sometime the wedding broke off because her husband started speaking on the phone with someone from his office in the middle of the ceremony  and there was a bad mess... I decided to go and eat somewhere, so there was a food court and I decided to go to McDonald's and order smth. I ordered the food, paid for it, but it never arrived (this could be an important message too)... After that the whole dream scene changed, I got to know that my ex's gf died due to some terminal illness nobody knew about (okay so lemme tell y'all, my ex actually cheated on me with his ex, now gf, and she is actually the third party between us and that's the reason we had a fight and fell apart). I saw her in the hospital bed lying dead and she had a red mark around her neck as if she was hanged or smth and my ex was beside her. I genuinely cried for her although I don't even know her in person and even after knowing the fact that my ex left me for her and I felt really bad for her because I never had any hatred for her ever because it was my ex who fumbled, it's not her fault, she knew nothing about me. Afterwards, I started thinking about my ex and thought he must be with her but now that she's dead he's gonna come back to me...
After I woke up (btw, this was a morning dream) I was left with a feeling of sadness and concern for her and idk why I started developing this soft spot for her and also even after I woke up realizing that it was a dream I still kinda cried for her and felt like hugging her for a while (remember that, I don't know her in person so that means we've never had any conversations or neither we were even friends)",2024-05-10 06:35:12

The shooter was posting the bodies of their victims on instagram and somehow I was still alive and was viewing all these pictures of my friends and peers that were dead. So of course I have this dream on a school night. It makes me really scared to go to school because I have this feeling that dreaming about it was a sign that it’s gonna happen, which is probably unlikely, but I have heard about people dreaming things and it somehow manifesting into their real life.

In the dream, I was finding my way home on a night walk when some people warned of gangs ahead. Passing them was inevitable. As I approached, my flying skills returned. Been doing that in dreams a lot lately. Felt so amazing. Ended up impressing the gangs and earning enough respect to not be bothered. Also found myself doing skateboard tricks on a hill.

322,Dreams,"It’s 3:47 am, and I just woke up from a crazy dream","Here is what I just texted my girlfriend cause I needed to tell her about it: 

I just had the most thoroughly wicked and torturous dream  i think I’ve ever had… 

I was working in a building that looked kind of like a skyscraper that was under construction, and I kept feeling like I was falling even though I was standing still or sitting, and while that was happening I couldn’t move. I called my mom to tell her, cause I was freaking out, and she says that meant I was having micro-seizures. A little freaky, but nothing major and that I should go to the doctor and take care of it. So I make a Dr. appointment and go to sleep for the next day.

So I fall asleep and start having another dream, and in that dream I start to feel like I’m falling even though I’m standing still, however I can still move (I am in some nondescript indoor location). And then I think “**** I’m having a seizure while I’m sleeping, that’s really not good” (you can die from that in certain cases). And THEN I get this extreme feeling of dread. My heart started to race and I started to get extremely anxious. 

In front of me appears this YouTube educator named veritasium (he’s a real person) and it’s really hard to describe, but in my 2nd dream, I had a memory of watching a video in my “real life” (which was actually my first dream), where this same guy explained that when you are dying you basically hallucinate happy dreams. But since this guy didn’t want all happy dreams to be ruined by people thinking they are dying, he said there was a very specific thing that would happen only when you are dying — but in my dream I HAD FORGOTTEN WHAT IT WAS. 

Anyways, this is what was going through my brain mind as I was watching something akin to an in person recreation of this video that I was desperately trying to turn off somehow. My attempts to “turn off” this “video” just made the guy appear all glitchy and duplicated for a second as my panic levels were reaching a fever pitch. But somehow I was able to eventually get it to turn off by turning off a nearby TV or something. 

I exit this nondescript place into a huge garden party which is full of all my friends and family and your family and you. And holy **** this dream somehow I could see you so clearly and your full beauty and it filled me with so much love. I then remembered I had a gift for you, and I brought out this long flowing dress that seemed like an African dress for some reason (maybe it was the earthy colors and seashells on the shoulders) but it was also so beautiful and when you put it on the whole party started dancing in celebration and you and I were just dancing and having a good time and I kind of forgot about the first half of the dream. 

It was more like a normal dream at that point except it was extremely vivid and joyful. There was lively music coming from nowhere, which usually there isn’t any in my dreams. The only weird thing was I kept accidentally getting hurt. Like I would stub my toe or cut my finger or bruise myself every few minutes. 

At this garden party there was a curved staircase by the entrance with a bouncer or security guard. I was sitting on the ledge beside the staircase finishing a drink and just enjoying the vibes, when I jump down maybe a 1 foot drop and really horribly break my foot. Like blood is coming out somehow. It didn’t hurt though and The bouncer rushes over to help me, and before he puts his arm around me to support me he says “hey what’s that over there” pointing to a door across the street. I look over, and see a colorful door with a weird knitted heart shape attached to it. As I look back over the bouncer in confusion, he reaches his hand behind my head and I hear a little *click*

I am suddenly and immediately in a colorless void. I can’t see myself, I can’t hear myself, I can only feel.

I realize that the weird heart symbol on the door was the sign I was dying. I start to feel a dread set in. But it was such a hopeless dread that I had no choice but to accept it because I knew there was nothing I could do,  I was going to die in my sleep. I wanted to cry because I miss you and my family but the only thing I could do was slowly stop existing. 

In this colorless void I was in, there was a boundary at the edge of my last remaining sense (touch), and I could push against it somehow. But once I pushed a little too hard, the boundary started to close in. As the boundary moved past my fingertips and toes, I felt them disappear. Or rather, I stopped feeling them all together. The boundary slowly constricted, enveloping more and more of my body, and as each part of me crossed the boundary I suddenly lost contact with it. It made me wonder if the brain dies in stages and that’s why I was experiencing this. 

I remember being glad that you wouldn’t find me dead but so sad we didn’t spend my last night together. 

And then right as the last piece of me that could feel, the center of my forehead, was about to be consumed, I woke up in real life, and I can not tell you how happy I am to be actually alive and not in a dream right now…

323,Dreams,I hate dreaming about having a “fling” with inexistent people,"I often dream about having flings with non existent people. I guess my brain does that to fill the void of my actual life. Today, I’ve had another one. What hurts the most is how real they feel, how I can see those people’s faces in detail. It feels almost like I’ve shifted to another reality. I always wake up with a feeling of grief. ",2024-05-10 02:52:11

325,Dreams,Sword fight dream,"I had a dream where I was sword fighting someone. At first, I had nothing but a small knife and they had two long swords. They began swinging at me as I struggle for a while. I grabbed one with my hand on the sharp edge and spoke for a fair fight. They let go of the curved blade as I situated it correctly and we now fight evenly. After a few blocks and whatnot I stabbed through them a few times as they fell and I even vividly remember finishing him off with a few chops to the neck. 

I don’t know what to make of this.",2024-05-10 02:14:15
326,Dreams,"Has anybody else had ""prophetic"" dreams before?","What I'm referring to is something like what this video ( https://youtube.com/shorts/zH1KkN6b_uY?si=2Opk-AYogHX-dMyd ) describes. 

I used to get dreams like this alot back in middle school and early high school where the dreams would seemingly predict the future or show information that I couldn't possibly know at that point in time. I don't really get them anymore (or when I do, I can only say ""I feel like I've dreamt this before"" as opposed to being able to say with confidence ""I remember the exact dream I had about this moment"" like I could when I was younger). Anybody I told about this thought I was capping and when I told my parents, they brushed it off and said ""you're probably just feeling deja vu"". It feels like deja vu when it happens nowadays since I can't concretely recall if I did in fact have the dream in question (but I usually very strongly feel like I did). Whenever my parents brushed it off, it would legitimately frustrate me because I did firmly remember having these dreams that seemingly predicted the future before my very eyes. 

I in fact had a dream almost identical to the one in this video aside from some minor details: It was chemistry class, sophomore year, &amp; students in class weren't talking (only the teacher was and she said stuff verbatim to the dream). Another example I have (and sorry it's kind of a gross one. It's one of the only few I still remember to this day. Just skip this paragraph if you don't want to read it) is when I dreamt I was on the toilet &amp; looking down into it seeing the water discolored reddish from blood. I was a late bloomer and was the only girl in my friends circle to not have had my first period yet. When I had this dream, I recognized the toilet as being from one of the bathrooms in my house, so I went to school after waking up and rushed home from school to use that exact toilet to see if I would have my period. When I got to the toilet however, there was already blood in it (presumably my mom's), so I disappointedly used it anyways (thus mimicking the dream of being on it and looking down into it).

INSERT: 

I remembered another example, but I didn't remember it until I had typed out everything else in this post so I'm inserting it here. You know in the first FNAF game when Bonnie appears in the left door and you see him when you turn the light on? In a dream, I saw that creepy **** in the exact pose, same **** expression, but without ears (maybe an overlooked detail I just missed during the dream) long before FNAF ever released. So when I saw it in the actual game, it really weirded me out. He had been so unsettling when I first initially saw him in the dream and it was even more unsettling to see him again in the game. 

I had gotten these dreams so many times that I noticed 2 things they all had in common that made it easier to identify if they were gonna predict the future or not:

1. The dreams always played out in 1st person perspective just as they would irl. A dream can't be prophetic in 2nd or 3rd person because they would not play out in the same perspective. 


2. Everything that occurs in the dream has to be possible and plausible. So dreaming that you're flying or dreaming of talking animals is out of the question (unless it's dreaming of looking at an electronic screen. I did once have a dream like this that showed me footage of boss fights in the ""Shadow of the Colossus"" 2018 remake AFTER the first trailer for it had released but BEFORE any of the bosses that weren't in that trailer had been shown in any media yet). 

I grew up my whole life believing I was going crazy or that I was the only one in the world with this superpower until I found this video today and read the comments and saw that other people had apparently had them too. So now that's why I'm making this post. To see if even more people have legitimately had this same experience before. Maybe together we can figure out what causes them and how to trigger them/increase our odds of having them. How cool would it be to have a legitimate way of consistently glimpsing into the future in a way that science might never be able to explain? We could possibly prevent tragedies and unlucky incidents this way.

SIDE NOTE:

In freshman year of high school, I had a friend who told me about a completely different type of experience he had with his dreams that I regrettably and hypocritically brushed off as cap but maybe I might be wrong about it (if other people can truthfully say they've experienced it too). 

He described to me that when he would sleep, he could leave his body and walk around like a ghost, however he could still experience pain and any injuries he undergoes in this state will leave physical wounds on his real body. He showed me some scars and recent wounds on his arms that didn't appear to be ""self inflicted"" (sorry I don't want to say what I'm exactly referring to as I don't want to trigger anyone who has dealt with that). After this occurred for awhile for him, he told his brother about it, &amp; his brother told him it happens to him as well, but I guess they can't see each other when it happens or else they would've figured that out about each other. It seems that just like a typical ghost, nobody can see them at all as the friend told me that the first time it happened to him, he thought it was just a dream until he went to cross a street and a car clipped/grazed him without swerving or honking and he felt it and realized it wasn't any ordinary dream.

330,Dreams,Dreams about not being able to find work clothes,"Hey everyone, I (27F) have been having recurring dreams for years now surrounding my retail and customer service jobs. I call them stress dreams because they often highlight genuine fears of mine like oversleeping and missing shifts or being scheduled at two jobs at once. The most common motif I experience is me trying to find my work clothes (pants, shirt, socks, shoes) and I can never get the full uniform complete. Sometimes I will have 3/4 pieces and then suddenly my shoes become flip flops or I lose my socks. I guess I would say it’s usually the shoes that I cannot complete. Sometimes it’s digging through baskets of laundry and not being able to find any pants. I will end up trying to get dressed for hours while my shift goes by and I never make it. They become increasingly more stressful the “later"" I become and I often wake up sweaty and stressed. I will dream about both current and previous jobs that I no longer work. They are never surrounding customer experiences, only my inability to successfully get to work. I am not a frequently late person at all and have plenty of uniforms and socks.

He looks like a monk of some kind, with the clothes and everything. I just remember a feeling of joy and tenderness towards him and reaching up to touch the skin around his eyes. in the dream i know i was wearing eyeliner as is my practice in waking life. he wasn’t wearing any of course, and that makes dream me think i should check my eyeliner and so i look in the mirror — the reflection i see is of the monk, but he’s wiping away my eyeliner on his eyes.

337,Dreams,Wandering around in a store searching for someone I'd gone shopping with but lost sight of,"I'm just writing this here before I forget and in case anyone has any ideas what it might mean.

Had a strange, very vivid dream. Lost sight of my mum in a store while shopping together. Looked like a book/record store, with about five floors, we were wandering around the aisles in each floor and then all of a sudden couldn't see her, looked around the whole floor, then went up to other floors, still couldn't see her. 

Eventually went down to the ground floor and thinking of going up to one of the store staff to ask them to make a PSA, but really don't want to because that would be embarrassing and draw attention, when I suddenly hear my name called out in her voice. I look around still can't see her, I hear my name again, look around and spot her, top of head first, then face, wandering around a few aisles away. Then I woke up (to a very noisy fan, it's warm tonight).

Also while wandering around looking for her, on one floor got stuck trying to get down (or up?) the stairs, there was a swing, that was supposed to get me from the bottom to the top, it was somehow hanging from the ceiling in front of the flight of stairs, so you could get on it, swing, and then jump off on to the top step, but when I got on it, everytime I would swing back and forth, it would swing too hard and too high away from the stairs, eventually Jaden Smith (Jaden Smith?) shows up and shows me how to get off the swing and use the stairs, warns me that the swing often does that, so probably better not to use it and to just go down (or up) the stairs.

Irl I have no relationship to Jaden Smith, never think about him, not a fan, nothing, last time I saw his face was looking at Met Gala photos two days ago, along with 100 other celebrities. Maybe it was someone that looked like Jaden Smith not Jaden Smith in the dream but that's what I remember it as.

Also while wandering around, I hit one of the floors and it's full of people, working. I realise the floor is being used as an office and not part of the store and that I might actually know someone that works there who I really don't want to run into, so I quickly leave. After that is when I get stuck on the stairs with the swing in front of them I think. 

Felt no distress in the dream, in the part where (Jaden?) was showing me how to, or how not to, use the swing to not get trapped on the flight of stairs they are in front of, we kind of laughed at the end, and then he walked away and I continued looking around the store.

Don't know if the dream was long or short so I chose the short dream flair but it felt...full, like a movie. and it ended, I found her. Dreams don't always end.

340,Dreams,Surreal dream of military or alien invasion.,"(You can skip this paragraph)Let me preface this by saying that I know this is going to make a lot of you believe that I’m a hardcore conspiracist by day, but truthfully I’m not. However, I don’t really discount much. I just have to see something really to TRULY believe it.

My dream begins. I along with the majority of my immediate family were at my parents farm. My girlfriend and I, my parents, my two uncles, and my grandparents. We were all in the front yard conversating, almost like everyone was getting ready to say their goodbyes and go home. Suddenly I hear and eerie mechanical noise high in the sky. I look up to see a massive, almost stingray shaped, aircraft practically directly above us. It was as high as the clouds, oscillating above and below them very slowly. I’m not a great judge on estimating the size of things when they are far away, however it looked to be the width of a football field. My uncle exclaimed, “Ah that’s their new ______ ship”. Everyone immediately a little more comfortable now just begins to watch it like they’re watching an air show at an airbase. Granted there isn’t another house in a mile radius I began to feel like something was off. As the long wings keep moving in a stingray style manner to keep it in the air something begins to protrude from the bottom middle of the ship. It’s almost descending like a giant chain rope, but very slowly. You can see the wind moving it. I start to power walk towards the garage urging my gf to follow me. She along with everyone else still watching in awe, I begin to get louder demanding her follow me…. Suddenly “Zzzzzzzzzpp” a laser shoots from the bottom of the thing that was decending, missing everyone. The laser recoiled so much that the chain mechanism used to lower it looked as flimsy as rope even though it was metal, but ultimately making it shoot in spurts to be able to accurately control it. Everyone besides my gf and I ran for safety to the front door of the house after its initial shot. In the garage my gf walks on into the house with the others. I watch a little longer from the garage. The laser zaps close to our fourwheeler. Letting out beams in short intervals just to be able to control it. It gave me the sense that this was definitely human given how the laser weapon didn’t look truly tested. After finally controlling the laser enough to slice an “X” in the fourwheeler it focuses on a volleyball until it does the same thing. I turn to go inside. Opening the door from the garage I’m met by the entire group of family that was outside  now huddled in the kitchen around the island peeking out at the front yard. There’s no time to say anything to each other. There’s an immediate sound of helicopter blades now coming from above us and the front yard. A helicopter lands right where we all were in the front yard that was carrying a modern truck and some type of military personnel. They waste no time. As soon as it lands they are getting out of the helicopter and looking at the house. I woke myself up at this point.

So wild compared to my average dream. I was initially going to just write this up in my notes, but then thought why not share it here.",2024-05-09 22:38:18

It started with me waking up in my dream to some rumbling and I picked up my phone at the side of my bed and noticed it had no service, my boyfriend (who I live with) was at work and I was confused. He always texts me when he’s on his way home and I never received a text. I was in the same house I live in but upstairs from my apartment was MASSIVE and had a weird swimming pool room with 3 layers of huge pools, all made with white tiles and smooth concrete floors which I could feel along with the water as I found myself standing in one of them. They all started draining rapidly and one of them collapsed and water started spilling everywhere. The water broke the glass windows that were in the pool room. I went outside through the broken windows and saw even more water like colossal tsunami amounts of it and it was all this weird icy blue color. I noticed there were massive cracks in the ground now and it was splitting into clean chunks with huge ravines underneath, I saw my neighbors house halfway into the ground then I noticed myself falling, I fell into what seemed like a half melted iceberg that was frozen on the outside but there was water inside, all of the ice shelves I was seeing were raising up out of the ground and I thought, there’s no way my bf is getting home okay he’s stuck in traffic for sure. And then I grew these light green crystally wings and broke out of the iceberg to take flight and go find him. I woke up after that

Well there has always been this.. standing out dream series. I'll send a pic of it in a moment. 

Well the latest dream, it felt.. melancholy. We were in some sort of indoor playground or adult fun center (not ****) and it was just.. fun. But towards the end I saw the girl once more. A clear, spitting image of her. Same blonde hair from before, same smile I could never forget and we were running to the exit with me close behind. And like a movie scene, I saw her continue running but turning around, and holding a hand out as she went towards the light. And she smiled, and as I reached for her, I woke up. 

I believe in soul mates and all that and I have a high intuition but.. I don't know. I just feel that it's something that has been on my mind and I don't know what to do..

354,Dreams,Dreamed of Chinese Dragon,"Hello! I just joined here, in hopes that you can help me figure out what my dream means.

Lately, I've started to be into occultism and mysticism, and I've started trying to commune with one of the most powerful sorcerers in the history, King Solomon.

Then yesterday before I slept, I prayed to meet King Solomon in my dream, to talk with him, but my dream went like this instead:

We've been keeping a Chinese dragon in our home. This freely flies around inside the house. We're scared of it at first, then eventually we feel at ease with it being around. At the end or before I woke up, it was playing with a baby in a crib. (If this is important: Please note, that there's no baby in our house. The youngest we have here is 4 years old.)

I feel like this dream is different from any other dreams I've had. Most of my dreams I just take them for granted. This one, it feels like I need to know if it's telling me something important.

I hope you can help interpret this dream. Please let me know if you need to know anything that might help. I appreciate anyone who answers.

355,Dreams,Dreams about losing my car or can’t stop my car. ,"A lot of my dreams lately seem to involve me losing my car or not remembering where I parked. Other times I am driving, but when I apply the brakes I can’t come to a complete stop. Sometimes these are dominant scenarios in my dreams, other times just a small part.

356,Dreams,Dreamt Of Lottery Numbers and Won,"Lately, my dreams have been so weird. I've found myself composing full songs within them, only to wake up and remember every note. 

Recently, there was this one dream where I held a lottery ticket, and a stranger beside me said I had the winning numbers. 

I jotted them down as soon as I woke up, something I rarely do since my dreams usually slip away. I actually won £3 with those numbers!

Should I keep using these dream-inspired numbers? I've never been one to play the lottery, knowing how slim the odds are.",2024-05-09 20:50:49

359,Dreams,Dream Sites/Apps,"I have EXTREMELY long and detailed  dreams every night. Often more than one that I can remember.  I’ve used sites like Dream Journal, which uses great because it allows you to detail things such as colors, location, numbers, people, etc.  

I’ve tried to do this numerous times with various sites and apps.  First I dictate them because they’re so long, but by the time I get through them and fix the dictation errors and make it so that it makes sense, it either gets erased, technically or by my fault, and it’s never saved.

Is there a site or app that allows you to dictate, or in someway be put your dream out there to decipher in some sense (AI) to record your dreams similar to Dream Journal. 

I’m 61. All of this used to be so much easier (hey I used DOS and dial-up 😉 and I grew up writing my dreams in a journal but now, typing all of this, especially because they’re so long ands full of particulars and characters of all kinds it’s become impossible. There has to be a more streamlined, “new-age“ method, e.g. a Dream Journal without having to type everything. If not I’ll go half with someone to create it. 💰🙃

Thank you, dreamers. 😴💙",2024-05-09 20:30:42
360,Dreams,I had a dream where I was being chased,"So there was a dream that felt like it was yesterday where I was being chased by the **** 

So I was at a party at night what looks like 9:45 pm (western time) so then me (guy) and other pal (also guy) so we were told to go get some ice from our local cart man (who has tons of ice) so we walked there and then when we were there we saw a light and my pal said “hey we should get back” and I was confused why so then we started to walk and walk faster so then the words that I can remember ringing though my mind was “go forth and run” so then I dropped the items and ran scared for my life and I lost him until just a few steps later I was caught Han had a super close up of the **** dudes face but he had his mask on and then it was blank for like 2 seconds and then I woke up seeing me burning on a cross with my pal and there was 3 and I was the one in the middle and it was a huge crowd then I woke up

That was my strangest dream that I am still confused about ",2024-05-09 20:29:02
361,Dreams,I had the worst dream ever.,"It started in my own living room. I stood up, and it was my birthday. I for some reason walked outside to the backyard, and walked into a warp. I went back in time, and had to relive every bad thing that's ever happened to me. ",2024-05-09 20:28:30
362,Dreams,Dreaming of my son when I've never had kids irl,"A few months ago,  I (f23) had a dream that I was pregnant, the dream lasted all through the pregnancy and included moments like my bf (m26) and I seeing the sonogram for the first time, baby clothes shopping. It ended with me telling him that I was in a lot of pain and needed to go to the hospital because I thought something was wrong. When I woke up, I was so emotional because the dream was so realistic. For a few days after, I was emotional and felt like something was missing. 
Then maybe 2 weeks later, I had a dream where it was like I was waking up in the hospital and saw my boyfriend holding our baby. He realized I was awake and brought the baby to me and said ""say good morning to Mama, john"". I saw the baby and he was literally the most adorable and precious babe of ever seen. I held him and fed him. It was like we were in a bubble of happiness. Then, I woke up. This time, I woke up sobbing. Like very emotional, uncontrollable sobbing. My boyfriend who was asleep next to me had woken up and asked what was wrong and I told him I missed the baby. Obviously, he was super confused and didn't know what I was talking about lol. After explaining it to him,  I just laid there and cried for what felt like hours. Again, the days following were very rough and It just felt like I was missing something. 
A few weeks later, I had another dream of him but this time he was a little bit older, maybe like toddler age. He was playing outside with my boyfriend and they were laughing and having fun. We went grocery shopping and he talked to me. He didn't sound like a kid though. His voice was just soft and smooth. No stuttering or mispronounced words. He was like a tiny adult lol. We finished shopping and went home. When we got to the house, I woke up. I once again realized it was just a dream and none of it was real. I missedt son but he didn't even exist. 
Fast forward to just a few days ago, I dreamt of him again. He was about 5 or 6, his hair was shorter, like a grown out buzz cut. In this dream, we lived in a house, in the country and we had a very long driveway. He asked me to take him to the mail box at the end of the drive way because it was his favorite thing to do. I said yes and we began walking. Were laughing and joking with each other. Just having a ball of a time. Then, he starts to tell me that he can't breathe. He stops walking and just drops to the ground. We're both panicking, I call 911 and the operator is being painfully slow. They're telling me to calm down and not yell while my kid is turning blue. I don't know what's going on. I yell at the operator and tell them to hurry because my baby is dying. I'm holding him in my arms and before he dies, I wake up. I'm sweating, crying and freaking out. My boyfriend wakes up and I tell him what happened. it's been a few days since that dream and I haven't dreamt of him again. I feel like something is missing. I miss my kid. I hope he's okay.  I don't know if this is a glitch In the matrix thing but I saw a tiktok of someone who had a similar experience say they shared it here. Hopefully someone has some idea of what this could relate to. Thanks for reading if you made it this far &lt;3

TLDR; Ive been having detailed, reaccuring dreams of my child who doesn't exist irl. In the latest dream, he might've died and I don't know what's wrong with me or how to feel. ",2024-05-09 20:19:55
363,Dreams,Dream Highlights ,"I had a few dreams today, which I was able to remember because I left a completely new notebook on the floor. That somehow helped me remember everything, without needing to write anything down either.

I was watching timmy the tooth, then found myself walking into a mall with demi moore. It seemed like she thought I was a younger version of her as we walked through the door together. We went shopping for dresses. It was shallow and uncomfortable for me. Another woman similar to dita von teese was there, a older lady. She was picking out the perfect dress as well. Discarding most of the clothes in the room, she found something high luxury. She left behind a vintage blue dress, dusty and slightly pinstripe. Looked 1940s. The man standing with it handed it over to us, almost like a magical godfather. She went into the section up ahead, into the other room. It was a white modern mall, renaissance influenced trimming and ceiling. I could see into the next room from the top of the entrance. Maybe there was a victorian style doorway. I was probably lucid, as I started to spin and fly. I felt blissful. It was high vibrational.

I felt like a real life goddess like amphitrite, venturing through the mall. I then woke up, too soon.

I then had another dream, because I was very tired.

I found myself in a warehouse. My sister and family was there, too. I don't remember the dream well. I was fidgeting with something that was leaking liquid candy. On a white plastic table in front of me. There may of been boys standing next to me as well. I needed to use a phone to take pictures. Across the room was a sign for evaporated milk. Likely carnation. 101 angel was said above the ad, on a price sticker/seperate ad. I needed to take artsy photos in front of it; it claimed the effect of the milk could turn you into a water fairy/nymph. I'm pretty sure that's what it said. The ethereal energy of it, made me yearn for ironic photos. The angel number got my attention, making me desperate. I got so excited, ending up waking up suddenly. My sister was gonna let me use her phone, maybe. I remember her picking me up/dropping me off from the playground. I was with young boys, contemplating breaking into the neighbors house. Or thinking about what the inside of the house looked like.

I woke up from the dream within my dream, speaking to my edward cullen poster about it. One of the other edward posters fell off the ceiling. It was so creepy. Aah, it felt like he was sentient. It was a eclipse one that fell. My main one is the twilight poster. The other was littler and attached to another poster.

I wished that my partner was there so I could tell him about it, I thought to myself.

I had another dream where I was thinking about a real life house where my grandparents apartment is. It was a old farmhouse, with a gothic looking dead tree in the front. Some tank is also in the yard. I must've been dreaming of stuff I was thinking about, as I was falling asleep.

Me and my mom went to my grandparents house. We passed by a street of midcentury homes, which also exists in reality. My grandpa was there alone, with a collection of doughnuts. They looked like krispy kreme donuts. I wanted some. But didn't get any. That dream led into the next, where I was in a '90s cult movie. Doom Generation but with more of a tank girl style, with punks. Crust punks. Industrial music was playing; with bands I haven't heard of. The number 16 was in one of them, it popped into my head like it was important. Amy blue and me were friends. I looked at the different band names/logos. They may of been flying above our heads, in dream fashion. Thought bubbles. Hah, like pop art. Which is the style of doom generation.

In the last dream, I was dreaming about the alice in wonderland movie. I was in a room or game server, eating a phyllo pastry that was full of galaxy colored cream. An australian guy tried to hit on me, harassing me more so. '*Eat like an australian.'* He told me, embracing me after I ate politely. *'You remind me of an aussie girl.'* He probably said, *'Back home,'* too. I saw myself as an avatar, IMVU looking. I was blonde. I may of been wearing a yellow shirt. Positive. Cat on my lap as well. Bare **** were out. They looked beautiful, and perfect.

The guy followed me around, interacting with me. It felt like it was real. Conscious.

I woke up, still fatigued. I didn't end up falling back asleep, and wasn't satisfied with what I dreamt to write.

Edit: The 'operation birthday surprise' episode from timmy the tooth was a reference to the new birthday cake pie from burger king. Also, one of the characters in monsters at work inspired that because they looked like the cavity goon and used the term 'operation' for their code names in the show. ",2024-05-09 20:10:08
364,Dreams,Semi-conscious dream experience,"I don’t know what to call this, but it was brief and intense.  I was trying to fall asleep and had barely set my head down and all of the sudden I am in the woods, it’s dark, I’m looking at these people that were not part of my group in a clearing around a fire.  I’m with a group of shirtless men with some sort of primitive sarong or skirt and I’m also a man in the group.  It felt like we were waiting to attack. Meanwhile, I’m still mentally aware of my real body, so I tell myself to open my eyes.  I open my eyes and I’m back in my room, everything is normal.  Weird, but who knows?  I think okay, I’m fine.  Then I shut my eyes and I am right back there again.  This happens a few more times as I open and shut my eyes.  Every time my eyes shut I’m 100% in it.  I realize it’s not going away.  It was too weird for me, so I got up just wanting to shake that off.  

Normally, if I start having a distressing dream and I’m still awake enough to open my eyes for a bit, that cuts the connection.  Is this some sort of different dream state?  

FYI I had my eyes fully checked not long after this and there was nothing abnormal going on there.  It’s not the first time I’ve dreamt I was living a different life, but I’m just curious why I couldn’t disconnect.  Eventually I did because I didn’t have that again when I went to sleep hours later, but what on earth would cause such a different reality just closing and opening your eyes? It just doesn’t seem right. Is there a hallucination that can only happen with your eyes closed?  I’m just at a loss as to how to explain it.  Maybe there are some people who know more about neurological functions that can explain it to me?",2024-05-09 19:57:48
365,Dreams,Dream meaning?,"I took a nap about 4:30pm today. The visuals of my dream were similar to being on lsd; everything was vibrant, detailed and had a bit of life to it. My **** opened up slowly from the bottom and my testicles started to come out so I caught one and held it in the palm of my hand at eye level. Fear came over me. Then the **** turned into an avocado 🥑 and the fear subsided and a feeling of awe and intrigue came. It was so real and I was very conscious of everything that I made myself wake up to see if it was real.

366,Dreams,Help interpreting or explaining a dream,"Hi there, I had a dream that I wanted some guidance on. So last night I had a dream were I was talking to this guy, he said he wasn’t feeling well and I could sense something was off with him. There was another woman off to the side. I walked up to the guy and I said “let me look at you” and I put my hand on his chin to hold it and I instantly felt something. The lights in the room flickered too. Around where my fingers were touching his chin like heat waves mixed with shadow were rippling off and I looked him in the eyes and the answer came to me. I said to him “someone put a spell on you, it’s a Vodon spell, I can feel it. It’s a wicked spell too”. And the guy asked “well what can I do?” And I said “well, my magic is different but I’m good at undoing spells. The spell on you is bad but not powerful, I can help” and the guy said “sure, do what you gotta do”. I could feel the energy all around me and I channeled it and thin strands of light started appearing all around us, through us. The threads or strands looked like spider webs in the sun. I found the “right strand” and started to pull it from out of the guys chest and it started off white/golden but as I pulled it more it started turning black and oily. The woman that was off to the side started saying “you should leave it” and I was flabbergasted. She said “you know not all dark magic is evil” and I responded “yes, magic is neither good nor evil but that doesn’t mean it can’t be turned into a weapon. It’s about the intention”. And she said “voodoo can look evil but it’s not all bad”. And I said to her “yeah I know, what are you getting at?” And she said “nothing, but you should leave it, it’s not like he’s gonna die” and she started to walk away. As she was walking away I could see this super black aura emanating from her like a cloud of smoke and I shouted at her to stop and she kept walking. And I shouted “by knot of one I bind you!” And the strands around us started glowing and a single strand flew after her and like spun around her in a circle and shrunk into her and went from a ring to like a small ball of light that was in her body but I could still see it, like it was a ghost in her. She stopped in her tracks like she was frozen. And I continued to pull the black thread from guy and I said “we’ll deal with her once we help you” and I woke up. It all felt so real, and I’ve never ever been able to shout in a dream. When I shouted “by knot of one I bind you!” my voice was amplified like I was shouting through a megaphone or speaker, super loud and powerful and it echoed at the same time. I’ve never had a dream like that. If you need any additional context or information please let me know. Any help is appreciated.",2024-05-09 19:26:25
367,Dreams,Odd recurring dream,"Hi all, I am just finding this subreddit and am so glad I did! I have always been a vivid dreamer, and I write my dreams down when I wake up if I can remember details of each dream. For the past several years, I have had a recurring dream that is a bit distressing. In my dream, it doesn’t matter where I am or who I am with, I will get the sensation of something being stuck in my mouth that won’t fully come out. It is almost like a piece of gum is trapped underneath my tongue. As the dream progresses, I continue to pull more and more “stuff” out of my mouth with no relief of the feeling. Almost like a clown pulling a stream of handkerchiefs out of their sleeve, I pull material out from under my tongue continuously until I wake up. I do have sleep apnea but I am treated with a mouth guard that has greatly improved my quality of sleep. This dream has occurred both before and after starting OSA treatment so I don’t think it’s necessarily related to that. The scenarios and locations always change but the sensation of needing something pulled out of my mouth is consistent. Thank you for reading! ",2024-05-09 19:18:36

369,Dreams,Different dreams in the same “locations”,"Hi, I’m new to this. I’m female, 19, and for the last 3 or so months I’ve been having different dreams but they’re always in the same “locations”. The location is completely made up and basically seems like a different reality of things. There’s 2 main places and then about 3 less common places. 

The first place which I go to most commonly, and happened first, is a lake area with camp grounds almost but instead of campers we have little cute cabins and people I’m close to all live there. It’s hard to explain but I have very vivid images in my mind of what these places look like. But there’s that and then if you go down and follow this path it leads to the docks and stuff where people fish. But like I have my own room and so does my family and friends and everyone acts as they would In person, usually the dreams here are chill nothing crazy happens usually it ends up involving a friend I once went camping w and some stuff happened to them, it was kinda traumatic, maybe that’s why. 

The second most common place is this like dystopian city almost idk how to explain it. But very cyber like if that makes sense? But it’s very dark always night time. The buildings have lots of lights and I’ve either been driving around or at an airport or at the mall shopping and at the mall I always end up going inside the same store and it’s very me. Lots of decorations everywhere lots of colours very maximalist. One time I found a lotion there that smelt good and I wanted it but was sad when I woke up and realized I couldn’t.

371,Dreams,Recurring dreams about public bathrooms??,"I often find myself having these weird stressful dreams that I’m somewhere in a large public bathroom and really have to go but something is always wrong with the stall doors and there will be water/**** all over the floors. Like SOMETHING will always prevent me from being able to use the toilet whether it’s a nasty dirty mess or strangers being able to see into the stall because they stalls are broken or something and there’s usually men in the bathroom as well. A lot of the time there’s also people I know there too but usually acquaintances- not people I would feel comfortable peeing around. 

It’s just distressing lol and I don’t understand why I have this dream often. I don’t THINK it’s because I have to **** in the middle of the night but I have thought about that a possibility. Any thoughts? ",2024-05-09 18:28:00
372,Dreams,I just remembered a weird occurrence when I was a kid and I need to know if anyone had a similar experience ,"So I was maybe like 6 or 7 and I remember distinctively that I woke up in the middle of the night and I saw little videos floating around me. I could touch them and look at them in detail, hearing everything that was going on in them and I saw that these were videos from my life (like memories). The weirdest thing is, it wasn't just my memories but also things from the future?? Basically some things I saw then came true later in my life. 
During this dream (or hallucination) I woke up my mom and told her to look around and help me catch more of these videos but she just told me to go to sleep (understandable 😅). 
Anyway, in the morning I was very confused and I asked her what was I talking about at night and she said that I never woke her up and she doesn't remember anything.

I asked my mom about it a few times later and she still doesn't know what I'm talking about. I think this is one of my weirdest memories and I'm wondering if this was a hallucination or a dream? Why some of these things I saw happened exactly how I saw them (causing the weirdest de ja vu every time)? Does anyone have a similar experience?",2024-05-09 18:22:52
373,Dreams,Crazy dream,"Ok, so in my dream I was **** and two cops were driving me (they were my Uber I was not under arrest in my dream) there was a old woman who was arrested DUI that I kind of don’t remember how she played in, either way while driving home we saw an UTV/razor go up a restricted area and crash and so the cops obviously check it out and I did too and it was a few of my real life friends, one of them destroyed his dirt bike, and there was a dead kid in the UTV. Flash forward I was dancing outside of a house seemingly waken up from my drunkness and I was slow dancing with the woman in real life I am heavily crushing on. She says something about stocks and I say “if you were a stock I would pick you” and smiled and she immediately got grossed out and left away from me. I had no idea what happened so I went to my real life best friend and he said “you’re losing man” and I said “no I lost” and I looked in the mirror and I was missing teeth and my entire jaw was mangled. Teeth hanging on by gums. It was nasty. After that I woke up in a cold sweat. Any interpretations?

But I love hearing other people’s dreams and had an idea to create a book just filled with all types of dreams people have had. 

I didn’t feel comfortable just going around the internet and nabbing people’s dreams without them knowing, so I created a form for people to fill out and submit their dreams anonymously, or be credited, and would love to get a ton. So please fill it out and tell me your dreams! You can submit more than one. 

Feel free to also just respond to this post with your dreams, and share this post and the form with your friends or on other social media! 

I don’t have a lot of the details worked out, as I’ve never created a book before, but I will post updates if anyone is interested.

379,Dreams,probably one of my favorite dreams but I’m still curious….,"Had a dream last night of myself here’s what happened

it was black almost moggy like all around us. water on the ground that was endlessly deep But my version of myself was sitting on top of the water not moving or floating just sitting there. They wore a white feathery dress with a silver belt had large white wings (4 as I recall) and they were holding a broken halo in their hand. My version was looking around as though they messed up like ”why did they do this to me why did they abandon me” as I recall them saying. Chains around their neck, wrists, ankles, waist and wings holding them down they turned to look at me with fear in their eyes and like asking for help but with no words. Light tears wept down their face as they stared at me then chains started to come up from underneath me and try to grab me but before that could happen the dream fazed out and jumped to the next part where it was the same version of me but this time they looked angry but also sad like they snapped and just got so tired of being “abused or abandoned“  they floated above me at a distance close enough for details. they looked pretty much the same ofc there was some detail change like there hair wasn’t fully brown it now had white tips there eyes no longer held color but rather all white heavy tears flowed down like a river without touching the ground (like normal crying but heavier) the chains where broken and flowing around as well as their hair. They had a sword or rather a Angel sword with black on it their halo was still they’re but broken they had horns and a devil tail their wings where the same but had black spots all over them and some black gradient. They weren’t hostile towards me if anything they acted like they could see me what was even more interesting was that they held there hand out to me and I felt like I needed to take their hand so I did. Feeling sad myself and angry while also believing I was accepted.

then I woke up and have been angry all morning feeling like punching someone. does anyone have any ideas on what this could mean?",2024-05-09 16:27:31
380,Dreams,Pink static,"I had a dream I was someone completely different. In my dream, I was in (their) childhood backyard and I invited my best friend from grade school over. I knew I was getting married to my high school sweetheart. The creepiest part is I felt everything. I felt the early spring morning breeze. It was crisp like it had drizzled over night. There were flowers in pots by a black shed. I remember seeing pink static just fuzzing over my vision.

The best friend was name Emma, a blonde slender woman. I asked her if I can confide in her without judgement. I told her ""sometimes when I dream, I'm different people living different lives. Lately some of lives I live are very sad and lonely. I've been feeling their sadness in my reality and I'm scared that one day I'll wake up in a reality not my own."" ",2024-05-09 16:22:14
381,Dreams,Intense Graphically Detailed Dream…,"I woke up from a nap a few hours ago and I’m finding myself somewhat ‘haunted’ by the dream I had whilst asleep. 

The dream started off fairly normal, I was in a house I didn’t recognise, with people I didn’t know bla bla bla, all normal dream stuff. At some point, however, I felt this sense of unease, as if I were being actively hunted down. I made a conscious decision in my dream to hide under a bed, something about this hiding under a bed is indicative of a real life experience but I am unable to clearly recall it. Moments after hiding, a man bursts into this room, I distinctly remember him making eye contact with me whilst I was hiding. Next thing I remember, I am being hunted down around this house before being cornered into and locked in a room with this same man. 

TW : GORE, VIOLENCE

With no more options left, he grabbed a fistful of pens, the cheap biro kind, and repeatedly stabs me in the throat with them. The oddest part to me, is how graphic and detailed it was. Anytime I have dreamt of any kind of gore or violence, it’s always been hazy. This time, I found myself almost spectating from above, everything was very HD movie-like and almost ‘impressive’ in the detail.

Any ideas or thoughts as to the reasoning or meaning behind any of the context or detail? 

Cheers :) ",2024-05-09 16:06:51
382,Dreams,Returning to the same world over and over,"Hey y’all!
I’ve been having these recurrent dreams, almost like an alternate reality. They are extremely mundane dreams, i go to work, i run some errands, i see the typical people i see every day etc, except it’s a totally different world

At first i was getting lost but every night for the past 2/3 weeks I’ve ended up back there every time i sleep. The world has expanded and I’ve learned my way around it, i know my schedule in that world and always what i need to be doing.

I know i sound insane and honestly i feel like I’m going insane. But it’s the same place every night. It’s so mundane i feel like it must exist in real life. It feels like some jumbled up place of everywhere boring I’ve ever lived- a midwestern town, with some buildings, a bit on the outskirts there are lakes and farms and woods I’ve been exploring in these dreams. It’s definitely not real, since some of the transitions between areas get jumbled up, but each individual area feels like it is, but I’ve never been to any of them in real life.

Sometimes the dreams kinda take on a weirder theme that’s not realistic (like flying or some ****) for a little bit, but at that point i don’t quite feel like I’m there anymore, but i always return before i wake up.

Has anyone had anything like this?? Like i said i feel like I’m going insane, it feels so familiar and is starting to consume my thoughts. Ngl it makes me excited to sleep, it’s just a continuation of my normal, peaceful life. But i don’t understand how my brain can form such an elaborate alternate reality that largely adheres to the rules of my reality, and take me back there with such excruciating detail every night.",2024-05-09 16:00:25

385,Dreams,Dreams predicting reality ,"Hello, I’ve had quite a few times where I was dreaming of something that later became true. One time, the real life was almost exactly the same with my dream so I’ll share it here.  
My grandmother’s brother was diagnosed with lung cancer(real life). They decided make a  family gathering at his house so we can all meet up one last time (they are 10 siblings + their kids + grandkids etc not that we couldn’t see him again, just everyone under the same roof). ( btw, I call him uncle) 
Now, usually, my daily life affects my dreams so a few times after the gathering I had a dream. 
In the dream I was in my room, on the phone with someone. I do not remember who and I found out that he was cancer free and finally healthy. Everyone knew it except me and his son. I rushed downstairs, both happy and annoyed (bc they didn’t inform us, and especially his very very worried son) and the first person I saw was my grandma. I asked her “why didn’t you tell his son that he is cancer free?”. My grandma replied and I woke up. 
When I woke up, weirded out by the dream I run downstairs to tell my grandma my dream. I told her what I wrote above and she told me “oh yeah, he doesn’t have cancer.  It was a wrong diagnosis from the doctor, he had an infection and they thought it was cancer”. 
While she was telling me this I was so confused because how is this possible that my dream is being repeated almost the exact same pattern? ( run downstairs from my room in a rush, finding out he doesn’t have cancer, everyone knew but me etc) 
This isn’t the first time it happened. Usually it’s not that spot on but they still come out real one way or another (not every dream ofc but a certain some of them).

386,Dreams,Strange dream about post Malone and using xtc,"Had the coolest weirdest dream that was very fun and lasted a long time. 

I was at my grandmas old house but it was very different, modified and expanded. There were many more rooms and lots of people lived there, and many others stayed there. In the most private room, post Malone and his girlfriend were staying there. I had gone down to hang out with them and they were very chill, we got to the topic of drugs and I asked him if he had cocaine. I assumed he was going to pull some out and share it with us but he did take some out and did a little bump to himself, which was somewhat disappointing (I never did that in real life, but in a dream I would), but then he takes out a few ecstasy pills in different shapes, one shaped like a **** leaf (I think I took that one). 

I was so ecstatic that he shared and that I met him and I went upstairs to try to put some makeup on for a party. That’s when I realized my extended family lived upstairs, even my mom. I had taken the pill so I was starting to feel high and it was very weird. Everything was a blur but I remember having a very hard time locating my mascara but I went onto the backyard where some of my cousins were sitting. I just assumed they were also on drugs but I felt very weird and alien like I wasn’t saying the right things or I wasn’t at the right volume. At that point it was just a little family hangout. 

I was so thirsty and aware of my dehydration and I wanted a water but there were only lemonades poured out on the counter and the ones I could reach were reserved and the ones higher up were just grapefruit I didn’t like, I don’t know what I ended up drinking but I was getting worried about being dehydrated. Some of my family was at the table in the kitchen and it was dimly lit. My cousin I don’t like was at the table and said something rude and I made a punching motion at her from a few feet away. The drugs made me even angrier at her than usual. 

I’m not sure why but maybe then I peaked after because I opened a cabinet and it was such a sight, golden glowing orbs that I can’t even describe, just a magical vision you can’t normally find in a cabinet. And I turned around and not sure if it was cool lighting or hallucination but the dining room and house were lit up with unending stars. I’ve never seen anything that unnaturally beautiful, it really was a spectacle. So spectacular that I feel no real life drug could imitate anything close to that. 

Then I notice in the backyard on the right side they were setting up for a fancy dinner, I assume for posty and his friends but I go outside to help. There’s a big chef man with a big cake heading to the table but there’s a cord or a balloon string something like that going to trip him so I go hold it down for him. Then I look to the back door and see my friends come out. I wasn’t expecting them (they don’t exist irl) but first [name redacted] comes out (haven’t seen her in 15ish years) then me and another friend (idk who) we go toward her and she lays on the step and we pet her forehead and hair. Then in the middle of this [second name redacted] from [workplace redacted] pops out the back door and wants to eat my necklace which is like a card with flavor, very confusing, maybe drug related. 

I don’t remember the dream past there, but the most vivid part of the dream was being high on ecstasy and hanging out with post Malone. I tried to research this phenomenon but there’s only studies about people relapsing in dreams, and I don’t use this and feel much more curiosity than guilt ",2024-05-09 15:06:01
387,Dreams,Dream,"I like talking about my dreams and this one has stuck with me for a while: 

I was in my house and was passing the kitchen and someone passed me. I turned around and realized it was my crush and he was facing me and I just burst into tears saying something along the lines of “I wish I could’ve told you but you seem so happy with her. I didn’t wanna ruin it” and he said nothing and I looked up and he kissed my forehead and then I woke up. (Context: he already rejected me when we were kids but I still had feelings even 7 years later and was wanting to tell him I still had a crush on him but he was dating someone hence why I said that in the dream)

388,Dreams,My friends think I experience sleep paralysis ,"So I have this recurring dream and I always know when it’s about to happen as I’m falling asleep.
The number one sign that it’s going to happen,is that I feel my whole body have this ‘static’ feeling a bit similar to ‘pins and needles’ sensation but more like if someone was trying to ‘hack’ into my body. It’s hard to explain but that’s the best way I could put it.

The events of the dreams aren’t always exactly the same but setting is always the same. I’m always in my room in my bed not able to physically move. These are some of the things that’s happened to me while in these dreams:
•an entity trying to pull me out of my bed
•an entity trying to trick me into speaking to my ‘friend’ in the dream.
•an entity standing beside my bed, hovering over me and staring me
•flashes of random people’s face
•being thrown around
•trying to wake myself up, because I know the only way to escape is to wake up. But there have been countless times where I try to open myself eyes and I can’t. Or sometimes I think I’ve woken myself up and I’m under the impression I’m in the real world again. It’s almost as if it’s trying to keep me asleep.

The entity I see is always a tall and lanky shadow figure, which at the start of when I started having these dreams it didn’t show itself to me until it slowly started doing so.
It’s honestly strange, and I don’t really know why I get these recurring dreams.

We were on a long two lane highway, surrounded by field. There was a white car in front of me, that suddenly went and veered off quickly speeding off. All of sudden there was a man next to my window, and a suv in park right in front of me. 
There was a women standing by the trunk with an older looking rifle, and all of a sudden. 
She shot me, and my vision went fuzzy all I could hear was my sister screaming and crying to drive. I then passed out or “died” in my dream and woke up. 
I could physically feel pressure where I was shot when I woke up, and it took me a good 10 minutes to ground back into reality. ",2024-05-09 14:35:06
391,Dreams,[TW] Wtf does this mean...,"[ TW: Animal cruelty, gore, detachment of limbs, torture. Marked as NSFW due to disturbing nightmare contents. ]

I had a nightmare where I was dismembering my dog while he was alive... It wasn't even with a weapon, I just... Pulled them off... I don't remember why I did it, but there was some kind of reason that I ""had"" to do that. I felt the popping of the limbs' sockets, almost like a voodoo effect... I wasn't harmed in my dream though, I just felt what I was doing to my dog on myself irl, if that makes sense. In the end, I stabbed him in the back repeatedly before waking up, traumatized.

In reality, I don't hurt my dog, I don't even ""spank"" him... Anymore... My first year with him, I only did that as punishment because I was raised with that being the norm. I always hated doing it and I always apologized and comforted him after. I decided to stop doing that, especially after getting confirmation that it's wrong to punish a dog that way. I feel a lingering guilt that haunts me every time I look at him or think about him. He does not fear me, he never did, but I feel like I will never be forgiven for what I did, despite how much I hated it and how much he still loves me and is overjoyed to see me. I added this bit for context if needed to better interpret.

TLDR; Traumatic nightmare where I dismembered my dog alive (by hand) then stabbed his back (with a knife) repeatedly until I woke up.",2024-05-09 13:49:36

393,Dreams,Do spirits connect to us through our dreams to show us what they've lived through? ,"There is no easy way to preface this and I know I may sound like a character out of a shameless episode but hear me out. I just woke up from taking a nap and Im at a loss for words because of how lucid this dream was. All that's left for me to wonder is if these dreams I keep having; every night, that are so specific, so real, are actually experiences from the dead? I know its far fetched to think but I've been told all of my life that I'm psychic or that I'm clairvoyant so it begs me to question that I'm being haunted by those spirits who have under gone something so traumatic that they leave me to suffer in my dreamscape along with them. I wake up in a daze each time feeling so at loss of energy, very confused. For example: I had just dreamed that I had been kidnapped and taken into a basement full of many other girls and that these men were using these women for money and selling them and that anytime you tried to escape there was obstacles in the way. Like, many pit bulls patrolling the whole yard to bite chucks out of your flesh; or thugs around the perimeters. I had gotten an attempt to escape and I took it and it lead me to the upstairs of the house which happened to be where children were playing. 2 little girls in their bedroom. I pleaded with them that their dad was holding us there and that she had to help us and she ended up closing her door fast and said that I couldnt be seen by anyone else in the house else they would **** me. So I did as they said and hid in their closet. They tried dressing me up to disguise me as a friend so that I could leave and they undid all of the traps in the house. Fed the pitbulls sleeping pills just so I could try to escape and when I walked out the front door I was greeted with their father who had abducted me in the first place. He looked at me and his daughters, they smiled and said ""oh hi dad, our friend was just leaving"". And he moved out of the way with hesitation and then as soon as he realized why he was outside in the first place, because he was looking for to see where I had gone. I was already out the front yard and down the street so he started to chase me. I ran like **** but he ended up catching me and I kicked him in the face and he ended up grabbing me again and I bit his arm and ran away. Thats when I woke up. So Is it safe for me to assume that me having these realistic dreams every night about different experiences of someone that was not me could perhaps actually be from spirits?",2024-05-09 13:39:35

It felt like hunger games movie. I was so scared, next thing I know. I'm in that house and there's many rooms, most you have to fight through your fears to get out. 

One room that was the scariest for me... it was a kitchen, the floors were checkerboard patterned, black and white.. there was a hole in the middle of the kitchen the floor and the floor would spin around in a circle and, it would try to get you to fall into the hole. 

The floor kind of reminded me of this coin eater I seen at a zoo.. the ones where you can spin a coin and it will continue to roll in a circle down the little hole. ",2024-05-09 13:29:00

397,Dreams,Nightmares as a teen,"(Tw) Hi, I’m 18 years old and have been having traumatizing nightmare for at least two years straight. I’d say 5/7 nights per week. Dreams about ****, blood, ****, anxiety, fear, things that make me wake up terrified out of my mind, having panic attacks at night and when I wake up I can’t tell the difference between reality and my dream.

I don’t read or watch anything scary, never been through something traumatic but I do have bad anxiety and went through a lot. I’m also a very creative and imaginative person which may affect the dreams.

They’re destroying my day to day functions and keep getting worse. I’m scared to go to sleep every night to the point where I stay up until past 4am to push it off until my body gives out.

 I don’t know how to make them stop and I need them to stop because I can’t handle this anymore. I need advice please, anything that could help. Thank you.",2024-05-09 13:13:22
398,Dreams,The table dream,"This dream happened before my other ones.. it was when Donald and Hilary first entered into presidential election.

I was leading a group of people it was nighttime. We had to travel under the cover of the night and I had us walking in trees and bushes. All the sudden this thing comes flying out of no where and was about to get me but my old friend Tanu came out from the bushes and sacrificed himself. This was a drone and it transformed into a humanoid shape, it then had a Lazer and cut off My friends foot right at the ankle. 
Suddenly we were all running for our lives down a big hill, there were people who had on black/white/red shirts. It seemed as though the ones in black were destined to die, the ones in red got to choose and the ones in white were spared. We were running from a big white bus, that had an automatic gun attached to the outide/back/roof of the vehicle. I ran down the hill and there was a pool at the bottom so I jumped in. The pool was an inflatable kiddy pool a little above the knees , I dived in and there was a lot of men in blue suits, they were eating apples and cheese and drinking champagne. In the middle was Hilary with a black n white polka-dot tankini. I was like ""how are these people living luxury while we're running from our lives?!"" The next thing I know is I'm out of the pool... there's a little boy and he grabbed my arm and kissed my cheek or forehead and when he did it sent chills down my spine. This boy said ""you can come with me to find my little sister."" The boy was safety, the boy led me through a field and he said ""you must be careful where you step, there are bombs &amp; booby traps hidden."" The boy started talking to me about his father &amp; said he will take me to his father's house.  When we got there it was crazy.. the house had a lot of gadgets, and a LOT of clocks! The house was covered in inventions the father had made.. the father wasn't there but I remember feeling a love &amp; I remember thinking that it feels like he's home. I got to see this table. It was COVERED in math equations and @ the center there was this equation that my heart knew to be ""the math equation of life"" 

Then it turned into a dream of me running outside to check on my kid as I thought she was getting kidnapped. It was just a random guy on a motorcycle leaving us gifts. Then I heard a loud voice from the sky say ""the liquid bombing as been delivered to the house of delivery"" and arrows were pointing from the North. ",2024-05-09 13:03:44
399,Dreams,The future of America part 1. ,"The dream started like this.

Two men dressed in all black suits and sun glasses. They somehow took me to a room with a wooden table. The table was unlike anything I've seen (I've seen it in another dream.) It reminded me of a cut diamond, 💎.  Pointy bottom but the top was flat. There they showed me a map. They said ""this is the future of USA"" and it zoomed into the Westcoast. They told me there would be some ""dam"" failures, they told me specifically there is one in Canada that will also somehow affect us. Basically Seattle was gone, a lot of our west coast was under water. Then the letter 3 showed up. I'm not sure what it was meant, 3 days, 3 weeks,3 hours? 

A few weeks later... they were back. Again the same table the same ""this is the future of USA"" line. They showed me a map of the full USA... I seen 6 fireballs (wasn't sure if they were bombs or what) that spread across our whole country. Then I seen that almost whole coastline was gone from our east coast, Florida was under water and it showed me Texas was underwater too. It showed the 3 great lakes turned into one big body of water and also looked as if our country had a new river running through it.  I forget specifically where but between east coast going past great lake towards texas; 

There was a dream that happened before this that I feel explains the Dam I will write it in the next one.  The table was also in the other dream. 
In these dreams the table looked like it was defying gravity, and the top part reminded me of a smart phone, they pulled up different maps. 
In the other dream, it was all wooden and had math equations written all over it. ",2024-05-09 12:44:24
400,Dreams,Had a terrible dream that shifted to nightmare of one of my worst fears.,"So, I went to sleep like usual after a long day, nothing out of the ordinary compared to most nights. Once I was in a dream, I was acutely familiar with the fact that I felt like I was dreaming but I couldn't remember if I fell asleep at all, it was daytime, possibly noon since I could see orange light from my window curtains. Suddenly, I see my uncle walk in and tell me that he and my grandmother were going to the store for groceries, which was normal since we had two fridges at my house. So, I yell to them goodbye and that I love them after my uncle left the room. After what felt like a few minutes after hearing the front door close, I laid down on my bed and contemplated if this was a dream, but as I was doing so peacefully, my uncle walks out of the room across from mine and all alarms suddenly go off in my mind and I get up with full fight AND flight engaged. He walks towards me slowly while smiling, which really put me on edge. After fighting with him in a struggle against his intimidating height, he is 6""3, I suddenly wake up in a cold sweat and see an almost exact bright orange light through my window curtains that morning after waking. I immediately bolted out of my room and went to the living room where I would have a good escape through the front door and a decent view of my uncle's room, which is where he came from in the dream. I couldn't see him as my uncle for a few days and Everytime he smiled from a joke, I would be put on edge...just waiting for his smile to shift and him starting to walk towards me again.

402,Dreams,I was a ghost. TW: I burned a monster snake,"I was some sorta ghost, walking around people. I wanted their help to get back to normal. All I could do to get their attention was tap SOS on them until they noticed.

I reached inside a kid's laptop and started talking through its speakers. ""I'm trapped. I'm right beside you. Please help me.""

A big python crawled out of a hole and was trying to bite that kid. I tried to warn him but he couldn't see it.

I grabbed that snake behind the head and the tip of its tail, held it up, stretched it out straight, choked it, and started blasting it with magic fire as bright as the sun. The kid was finally able to see it and me and got behind me.

 I cooked that snake until the meat started to fall off the bones. The kid was safe, and the bones of my hands were visible through tears in my skin and glowing like my insides were on fire.

No more pain, no more fear, and I didn't care about anything except killing that snake before it could bite.",2024-05-09 12:22:39
403,Dreams,The most terrifying dream I've ever had,"So a few years ago I saw a really short dream.

I was staying at my grandparents' place. It was around 2:00 PM i think. I was in the living room. I was hanging out with my cousin. Then he went to the other room to do something. My little brother was just spinning around in the living room, you know what I mean, youve probably done it too as a child. Then my phone rang. My mom was calling me (at least thats what it said).

Also my screen was bright red for some reason. I answered and it was NOT my mom. It was a scary robotic female voice that said something about buying something, like a scam caller. It continued speaking for a bit, but I didnt hear what it said. I was in complete panic. I knew that something was coming for me in a matter of minutes - maybe even seconds. I knew that the ppl coming for me were gonna take me away from everything. forever. to a horrible place for eternity.

And then I woke up. Also now you might think: ""Surely that wasnt THAT bad"". But yes it was. In the dream the female voice was very very frightening, yet still calm. And it just felt really really scary.",2024-05-09 12:22:33
404,Dreams,Aquatic multiplying lizards,"Last night, I had a very odd dream that stressed me out (within the dream). In my dream, I had a large fish tank as my own “ water ecosystem” but it was empty, aside from the picture of plants inside the tank. Suddenly, a large orange fish appeared while I was talking to one of my friends on the phone. I was so excited that there was finally life inside of the ecosystem, but then another appeared and when I looked more closely it was two turtles coming out of the plant photo.

(The plant photo is the typical pictures you see in tanks that you can buy at the pet store and whatnot. )

I was explaining to my friend on the phone that something strange was happening and a ton of turtles and very large aquatic lizards (more lizards than turtles) started coming out of the photo. Real plants were suddenly inside the tank as well. The fish and turtles were no longer the main subject, as the lizards started taking over.

There were types of lizards I’ve never even seen before, while some looked like weird chameleons, with the skin of a frog (one in particular did and it was very large and blue all over). This one tried to bite the face of another lizard, but I tapped the tank and kept saying “No, no, don’t do that!” Because I didn’t want any violence to happen and it was like it understood and stopped to look at me.

There were at least 15, if not more, “large” aquatic lizards in the tank. I was becoming overwhelmed and stressed out in the dream, asking my friend what to do, but I can’t remember what he told me. 

I noticed there was an opening above the tank and two or three lizards (one being the large blue chameleon looking one) were trying to climb out. I panicked and didn’t know what to do. I didn’t want to get bitten or have all the lizards trying to escape. I tried to use something to cover the opening so they wouldn’t escape, but it wasn’t working.

I don’t remember much of the dream after that. I’m not sure what this dream could have meant, but it was a strange one to say the least…


Tl;dr: I had a dream where a bunch of large aquatic lizards took over my water ecosystem and it overwhelmed and stressed me out in my dream,and  I tried my hardest to contain them within the tank, while some were desperately trying to escape. ",2024-05-09 12:10:28
405,Dreams,“Your relative is dead”,"Literally woke up just after hearing those words in my head this morning. Like a voice said to me: your relative is dead. 

So weird and frightening. 

That said, I’ve spent the last week and a half dealing with a family blow up where I think I’ve been cut off by brother and his family. It’s pretty upsetting. So I wonder if my subconscious was reflecting on the end of that relationship as a death rather than speaking to actual death. ",2024-05-09 12:08:47
406,Dreams,Deciphering the meaning of a strange nightmare/sleep paralysis episode,"A few years ago I had a really strange dream while I was pulling all nighters frequently during the first few months of the pandemic. In the dream I was hanging out with a bunch of random people, and one person from my school that I recognized. After a few minutes of idle conversation, the dude from school I knew said something extremely strange. I can't fully remember, but it was something along the lines of ""what happens when your death count hits zero?"" or ""what happens when you die for the last time?""

After that my vision in the dream went completely black, and white symbols that only make sense in my head started flashing. I can't describe or put them on paper, but I can still sort of make sense of it in my head. After \~30 seconds of the flashing symbols, I woke up in sleep paralysis. It lasted for a few minutes and then when I sat up in bed I fell back down into my pillow and had a repeated bout of sleep paralysis. 

The repeated sleep paralysis happened 3-4 times, and I honestly cant tell if that part was real or a dream, it felt incredibly real but I haven't ever heard of someone having back to back sleep paralysis a few minutes at a time. I would love if you guys could offer your thoughts on what this could mean, happy to answer any questions as well.",2024-05-09 12:06:44
407,Dreams,Dreams about war,"I think this dream occurred right when the russo ukranian war started. So me, my brother and my grandparents are living in a large apartment in an apartment building. Once every year I think the government comes to check if everything is clean.

I actually live in Finland btw, but in this dream I lived in Thailand so it was the thai government.

Anyway the government was very corrupt. If there was anything in the house that wasnt as clean as possible or anything that wasnt in its place the government would just shoot the ppl living in there. The government would come in 6 hours and the house was looking AS MESSY AS POSSIBLE. My grandma started cleaning, me and my brother realized theres no way we can do this in 6 hours so we just threw everything into one room and hoped the government wouldnt check there. It was a small room where we stored mattresses. My grandpa on the other hand did absolutely nothing about it.

Then the government came. They approved every place, but then it was time for the mattress room.

I cant remember if they approved it even tho it was REALLY messy or if they didnt and said that theyd come **** us in a few minutes. Anyway the few government officials left and everything was fine.

Until after they left the TV turned on and a news report came and said something about a nuke being dropped on Thailand and that a war had started. Then I heard a huge explosion and ppl screaming. It wasnt a nuke this time but a bombing instead. All four of us left.

Then I cant remember what happened, but me and my brother had gotten lost and we were in an underground parking lot standing in debris. We could se outside since the bombs had exploded so that we could. We also saw another parking lot a few stories above ground and our grandparents entering their car and driving away. Another bombing came.

For a good 2 hours me and my brother searched for shelter and ended up finding our parents just standing in a pile of debris. Me and my brother went to them and then all 4 of us got to a shelter. I cant fully remember what it was, but I think it was a new apartment.

I cant remember anything that happened after that moment. It was also never clear which country attacked Thailand (maybe China but idk).",2024-05-09 12:03:53
408,Dreams,Reaching the “Astral plane” in dreams,"Okay so this is the second time this has happened I wanna know what this means/is this all ****/has this happens to anyone else. So in my dream life felt decently real. I was back in highschool and was becoming decently good friends with this girl when all of a sudden this guy is telling me that I need to go to the astral plane to figure things out and he gives me a book that you write in and it help you get there. So I read what was in the book and wrote somthing down and fell asleep and woke up in the new world that looked indistinguishable from reality but at the same time had this spiritual/majestic vibe to it. In this field we’re different trials and tasks set up to help me learn things about my life. When I saw two of my Indian friends in there I talked to them, and told them why I was able to access the “Astral plane”, and how do I get out.  They said they didn’t know but I was able to. I wondered where we wake up after being here.  I was walking around thjnking about how to leave cuz I was a little freaked out so I close my eyes and I opened them and i was in my bed I had woken up from my sleep. **** just happend.

409,Dreams,used to dream about drugs all the time despite never taking them (at 14 years old),"just in case, warning for hard drugs &amp; overdose mentioned 




around 4 years ago (i would’ve been 14) i had dreams about drugs for around a year and a half straight. it wouldn’t be every night, and some nights were more crazy than others, but in at least 95% of my dreams, there were drugs involved in some way. but i’ve literally never taken a drug in my life, nobody in my family takes or has taken drugs, none of my friends did (as we were all children and very sheltered). it really confused me looking back as i used to “take” things like MDMA, LSD, cocaine, **** and “feel” like i was under the influence. in my dreams i would get visuals similar to that of LSD and MDMA. i also had dreams of overdosing.



 i remember one particular dream i had taken an LSD tab and throughout the dream my “vision” got distorted and people would shift in appearance in front of me and things wouldn’t make sense. in a dream where i overdosed i remember feeling incredibly groggy even when i woke up. most of my dreams would also feature me buying drugs from dealers even if i didn’t “take” them in the dream. i also had another reocurring dream where i would take MDMA at school and be absolutely off my face for the whole day at school. 




what is this about?? it absolutely baffles me ",2024-05-09 11:31:47
410,Dreams,I had a dream that contained a wolf and a fox,"So last night, I had a dream containing those two animals. My interactions with them were very friendly, about as friendly as interactions with wild animals can be.

The thing is, it wasn’t just me in the dream. There were other people who also wanted to interact with them, which they did. I had advised them to let the animals come to them, not the other way around.

The first animal that appeared was a grey wolf. Dude was a handsome and lively creature, looking and sniffing at me curiously. When I reached up to pet his fur, he was a little confused, but after a second he seemed to like it. Soon after, he disappeared, and the fox bounded in.

The fox was more active than the wolf, making all sorts of cute sounds and running all over the place. It was more receptive to human touch, and I don’t know if foxes in real life can purr, but the more I petted the fox, the more it purred. It also put its paw on a certain food it wanted, and I was about to give a bowl of it, but other things got in the way and I woke up before I could feed the fox.

Can anyone tell me what the **** this dream means??",2024-05-09 11:27:09
411,Dreams,Dogs &amp; A Man In A Suit,"I had a dream I was in my grandparents house with my boyfriend, holding my son as a baby. It was storming bad outside. I realized there were three big dogs in my house, one was a Boxer (the only one I actually remember the other two were different breeds both big one white w Muti colors and one black) I wasn't scared of them but I NEEDED my bf to get them out of the house. I walk into my bedroom and see my irl (deceased) pet dog and he growls at the boxer, doesn't engage, but runs to me. I carry him and the baby to the living room couch stressed and wondering if my bf is handling the dogs. Next to me on the couch a man ive never seen before, peppered short hair mid 50s in a super fancy fitted grey suit, sits next to me. He's leaning in talking to me, I don't hear what hes saying im just confused and nervous, he rubs his hands on my **** gently and I go from nervous to TERRIFIED. And then I wake up.  


I don't usually dream in such detail, with such strong feelings throughout the dream, and never feel physical touches while dreaming but I FELT his touch. It's been a few days and I still remember all these details, even the weather felt super relevant. My dead dog who Ive never dreamed about. Ive never posted here I don't know what protocol is but can't stop trying to decipher this one.",2024-05-09 11:24:41

413,Dreams,Recurring Dream: Balloon Flight,"A recurring dream I often have involves me holding a balloon and using it to fly.

It always begins with me walking on the sidewalk next to the home I grew up in. It was a corner house and I'm coming down the side portion of the sidewalk and holding the balloon. Then, as I'm walking, I jump and I go higher than I should and gently float back down like I'm almost weightless. The balloon is giving me some form of buoyancy, but it doesn't hold taught on its string. Instead, my jumping up causes the balloon string to go slack and the balloon catches up to floating above me as I gently am floating down.

But then, I start to kick my legs as I'm in the air. It's like I'm swimming. As long as I keep kicking my legs, I go higher and higher, but if I stop, I begin to gently float back down to the ground. I float higher and higher thru the air with my balloon until I can see the whole neighborhood from above. Not long after I've been floating for a bit up there, I tend to wake up.

Any thoughts on this dream?",2024-05-09 11:16:11
414,Dreams,Crazy dream while sick,"so, a few months back, I was sick. That’s not a good place to be in. But for some reason when I’m sick, I have these crazy fever dreams! These We’re my most recent: on the first dream, I woke up in a snowy forest, no one was around and the forest seemed to go on forever. After about an hour of walking I stumbled upon a diner. It was a 50s diner that had a gleaming yellow light inside it. I thought I could rest there and warm up, so I went to the door. But when I reached to the handle, it almost felt like it was slipping away. Then everything went black, and I woke up.

the next night, I dreamt that I was in my old neighbourhood, it was abandoned and run-down, but my family still lived there. on that night, we went to a McDonald’s for dinner in Dublin. Although, when I saw this McDonald’s, it was very different. For starters, all the words were Japanese, and everyone Looked uncanny And strange. After we finished our food, we got back in the car and drove off. But, on the motorway the car crashed, and I flew out the window. But as I was about to hit the ground, it went back to the diner. I could enter it this time, and my family was in there, but when I went near them… they turned to dust. This really freaked me out so I started running, and running and running. But on and on, the diner just reappeared. There was no escape. I had to wake up. so I climbed a tree, and jumped.",2024-05-09 11:14:09
415,Dreams,My most recent (interesting) dream,"So last night I had a the craziest dream in a long time. 

It all started when me, my little brother and my mom were outside. I was lookin at some bugs in the grass for some reason when i noticed i had some tiny buboes in my fingers. I thought: ""huh, thats weird"" and told my mom about it. She called the doctor and the doctor came to my house for some reason. 

He told that they were there because a very poisonous spider had bit me and that only Greek doctors had the antibiotics to heal me.
Then my principal informed me that I can take thursday and friday off school so that I can get healed. Also my principal was my elementary school principal, idk why.

Then the dream cut to me, my mom and my brother in the plane and then it cut to us being in an indoors waterpark in Italy, not Greece. I slid down the biggest water slide and it was fun. I still had my regular clothes on tho. My mom was standing next to the pool also in regular clothing.

She told me to go swap my clothes to my swimming trunks. I couldnt find the changing room at first but then found out it was in the bathroom place. I went to the mens bathroom.

There were a total of three sinks and a lot of toilet stalls. There were also three troublesome girls there. I knew one of them. A 14 year old, short, **** chick with a **** of an ackne. I didnt know the other ones.

I went to one of the stalls. It had a large dark green typical public bathroom door. I had already changed my swimming trunks on and for some reason still had my socks and shirt on.

Then one of the girls (the one I knew) knocked loudly on the door and said to open. I asked: ""Why?"" And she told a reason I cant remember. I remember that it made no sense tho. Then she opened it herself (it was clearly locked but still) and started yelling at me some insults and other stuff. 

Then I woke up from the sound of my friend scrolling on yt shorts. (we had a sleepover)

I finally had had enough, I snapped myself out of sleep only to find out the man in my dream was literally talking to the 2 hour long YouTube ad that had come on.

I got scared and grabbed my guinea pig when I saw him get out after.

421,Dreams,Secretive cult-like Group terrorizing Me,"Hi everyone, last night I had one of the most weird dreams and trying to think of what it could possibly correlate to, if anything at all. 

So, let's get into it. The setting was in my childhood house that I lived in with my parents and little sister. At first, everything seemed and felt normal, until I started noticing dark figures watching me and disappearing as soon as I would try to focus on them. These figures would never try and hurt me, but they were watching, always. It got to the point where I had no sense of privacy, it seemed no matter where I went or how hard I tried to get away, they were always there. These dark figures never made a sound or moved except to get out of the way of my vision once I've spotted them. 

This is where it takes a weird turn.

I told my mom about my mysterious stalkers, and she knew immediately what was happening. She explains to me that these figures have been following me my entire life, and that she and my dad have been appeasing them for as long as they could, but they were growing impatient. This cult of shadows has been more or less controlling the actions of my parents, and now soon-to-be me. There is no escaping this **** on earth.",2024-05-09 10:23:43
422,Dreams,I spoke to a me that was hanging (suicide in a tree) ,"I was walking around the house and came back to my room and found the inside of my room to changed into a yard, a tree at the centre with me hanging from it.

I asked what it was and asked me if I remembered my childhood, anything about it. I thought back to my old memories and recited them to him, he thanked me for ""not lying this time"". 

We had a rather cynical conversation afterwards, we spoke of life and he was harshly but lightly berating me in my own voice. I asked why and he responded ""All this time you have, each moment ticking by, the lightning caught in the bottle that is you; fizzles out. You **** up"". I pressed him asking what he meant ""You already know what I mean, you're just talking to yourself, like you always do. You just needed a clearer image to get it."" 

I felt an immense pressure and asked a last question, ""What should I do?"", he swiftly replied just before I woke up ""Don't follow me""

I still don't fully know what he meant, I have an idea but I would like to hear other interpretations.",2024-05-09 10:04:17

424,Dreams,Moon cracked/exploded into a bunch of pieces during some sort of eclipse event,"In my dream I was with a childhood friend and we were at a neighborhood pond fishing like we would normally do back then. All of a sudden in the middle of the day it got really dark, like it did during the eclipse a month ago, and everyone was outside in awe. The moon was about 20x larger than you would normally see it,almost like it was right outside our atmosphere. Everyone was confused as there was no predicted solar events,then all of a sudden there was large horrible crack noise and we saw the moon suddenly shake and crack up like glass, then crumble into a million tiny pieces and slowly start a free fall down to earth. I remember feeling scared in my dream knowing death was imminent and unavoidable, but also being at peace with it because of the fact that it was no way around the demise of life on earth. The craziest part abt it is I woke up from my dream in my dream and asked my girlfriend if she had the same dream as me and she was like yup. And then I really woke up.

426,Dreams,Dreams of SA (TW),"IRL context (M/27)

 - Started a new job at the end of March 2024 and I have been struggling to adapt to it, constant anxiety of what if I fail, what if I do a poor job, what am I even doing

 - Have been feeling isolated/alone in my romantic relationship, losing attraction towards her (F/25) and getting thoughts of wanting to be single again because our dynamic is becoming increasingly more parent/child (with me being parent) than partnership... she is still attracted to me though and I feel foul/dirty to be on the receiving end of attraction from someone who I am starting to see as a child

o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o

Dream

- I have been getting very strange recurrent dreams of me being aroused and attempting to force myself on older women (who know me well)
- Then getting slapped/stopped within 2 minutes
- Get scolded by them for being a piece of **** which stings in the dream because I respect them a lot... then I feel like I am trapped by my own impulses... a lot of feeling like a failure
- Wake up feeling disgusted with myself

The first time this happened I cried a little when I woke up because I felt vile... Then it happened again. And right now I woke up and it happened again.

It's always an older women, someone who is mentoring me/expressed care for me... which makes my actions in the dream even more abhorrent.

What is going on? Why this dream again and again? Can someone help please?... 😭

o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o-----o

Edit

After reading my own post.. my dream appears like a reversal of my IRL relationship.

My younger GF feels attracted to/aroused by an older, mentor-like/parent-like person (me) who cares for her.

In dreams, a younger me feels attracted to/aroused by an older, mentor-like/parent-like woman who cares for me.

Except in real life, I can't do anything because she is super sensitive and anything negative I say about her or about us ends up in her crying and me consoling her. She even cries if I am the one going through negative stuff and it has no consequence for her other than me needing time to myself. This results in me feeling isolated. The only version of me she happily accepts is me being a calm, patient, positive mentor. When I am being that she gets googly eyes.

But in my dream, I don't cry and don't get any sympathy... I just stand frozen until the dream ends.",2024-05-09 09:20:06

When i went up a ladder there was a black dye on the first platform were i sit and it turned out to be glue. There was a friend that i asked for help, he didn't help me. After a while i got up from there and continue to try and climb up the crane. When i get to the top i don't remember exactly if i slipped of the edge or there was already somebody that pushed me and fell into a ""game type void"" where you could've saved yourself if you fell on some platforms.

I asked my brain for something ****, tried to will it into being, nothing. The only thing I could do was wake up, if I wanted to. I stopped trying to control the dream and it put me back in the same store, buying the same Bionicle.

In the past, when I have discovered I was in a dream I was able to transform into and gain the powers of one of my OCs, one of which has godlike powers but I only really used shape shifting and mind control at the time. It wasn't the same thing as trying to directly shape the world with my mind.

433,Dreams,"I think I died, I’m so confused this dream has terrified me","First of all hello! I’m new to this sub and was hoping someone could help me make some sense of this or point me in the direction of another sub to post this in!

This dream happened a couple of months ago and has really stuck with me, it sounds so silly but I’ve had to process it for that amount of time because it was so terrifying. 

Just for context I work on a farm and the site is 300 acres, green fields etc- very blissful place to work!

The dream begins with me at work, I’m doing my usual chores it’s exactly the same, nothing looks different except for the fact it’s a summer day and the weather is glorious. 

At some point in this dream I see a congregation of people at the bottom of the farm all looking up at the sky, I think “huh that’s weird” so go over
In the sky there is this what I can only describe as kaleidoscope or mandala looking shape, it’s glistening so many different colours and is quite frankly beautiful. It’s pulsating, twisting and changing colours continuously but I’m there just staring, it’s utterly captivating. I can feel the sunshine on my skin and a soft breeze as I’m just looking up. 

Then out of nowhere this shape just gets brighter, all I can see is white, I’m blinded. 

This echo of a siren is all I can hear, no screaming just a siren I don’t feel like I’ve been moved by a blast or anything like that. 
The next sound is a robotic voice saying “all has been lost”

It sounds out 3 times, I hear something faint, a rapid heartbeat my own heartbeat it gradually gets louder and louder, faster and faster then flatlines. 

I feel myself gasping, panic flooding my body as a final “all has been lost” rings and fades until all I can hear is ringing- like tinnitus. 
The once white canvas I was seeing fades to black. 

I’m just there and everything is black nothingness, the ringing stops and it’s this vast silence of absolutely nothing. 

It felt like hours, days almost until I felt my body start to wake up. When I opened my eyes I threw myself out of bed and just bolted to the living room. I saw my partner and immediately told him as I just sat there visibly trembling. 

What the **** happened?
Does anybody have any insight on this?
I cannot stop thinking about it",2024-05-09 08:52:43

Then, outside of the mosque, there was a baseball field where someone we didn’t know was getting married. They saw us taking pictures outside the field and asked me to try on the mother of the bride dress to model it for them.  Then the couple got married and we all stayed in this huge hotel room with like 16 bedrooms and the newly weds got in a fight and ended up getting divorced then I needed to drive home and a mom, dad, and daughter that attended the wedding asked me for a ride home and I said yes but for some reason all I had was my moms minivan from when I was a child.

436,Dreams,Recurring nightmare of house being broken into. How do I stop it?,"How can I stop having nightmares of having my house broken into? I’ve had nightmares like this before, constantly checking the locks yet people are still able to get in and steal things from me. The dream is almost always in my childhood home, never in my current apartment. I do have OCD tendencies, so a “checking the locks” nightmare for me is not uncommon. 

However, in the area of where I live, there have been several recent occurrences of a man breaking into women’s homes and standing over their bed with a black ski mask on. This has triggered me to have repeated nightmares of break ins, causing me to struggle to fall asleep and stay asleep. I’m tired all the time, and I’m scared to fall asleep. Is there anyway I can reduce the prevalence of these nightmares? I’m open to anything!!",2024-05-09 08:08:32
437,Dreams,Recurring “Tamagotchi” Mice Dream - what does it mean???,"Ok first time poster here, so apologies if this is hard to read or get through, but I just think these dreams are too weird to not be immortalized on this subreddit.

It’s not unusual for my dreams to seemingly continue on from a past one (not necessarily from the previous night) or to have recurring themes, people/places etc. 

For the past few years (not exactly sure when it began, but I can remember dreams like this as far back as 3 years at least), I began to dream about a pet mouse that I had kept in a fairly large cage - one that was clearly meant for more than one small animal because it had multiple tunnels and rooms and places for food. Nothing else about this mouse was significant, just that it was mine to care for. Over the past three years, every so often in my dreams, I will remember that I need to go refill the food/water, get clean bedding etc.

Somewhere along the way, I started “rescuing” more rodents in my dreams and adding them to this cage. I had multiple small mice, different ages/sexes/colours/breeds and I had one medium sized rat. None of them had names. They were like a “side quest” of my dreams that I would occasionally return to.

THIS is where I start to question my sanity - The passage of time never really makes sense in dreams, but of all the dreams I’ve ever had, these tamagotchi mice seem to be the most “realistic” timeline wise - if I forgot about them for long enough, sometimes I’d find that their food and water was almost gone, one had gotten sick and died, or another had babies and added to the group’s overall population. 

Well last night the worst thing happened. I went to check on the mice (and one rat) and every single one of them had passed away - curled up with their brothers and sisters in their favourite spots throughout the cage. Their water was left for too long and they died of dehydration. Of course, dream me was devastated. I tried to scream but couldn’t so I sobbed uncontrollably until I woke up and realized none of this was real… 

But some part of me is actually mourning the loss of these pets and is wondering why the actual **** my brain has decided to put me through this lol 

Thanks for taking the time to read to the end - I guess I’m just curious to know if anyone else has experienced dreams like this?

438,Dreams,Last night I dreamt that my laptop shrank. What does it mean?,"I rarely remember dreaming. When I do, I only remember bits of it, or not even that, but have a feeling about it. This dream was kinda comical. I had my computer on a hot place and the fan was on and placed right before the laptop, to keep it cool. Then I went to bed (in the dream) and when I woke up the computer was like an 11"" old macbook air size. But I have an Asus TUF gaming, 15,6""! It was still the same laptop, but tiny! I would cry every time I looked at it! But it was still working and I kept wondering if it would expand back to it's normal size! LOL  
But because I never remember my dreams, I like to try to understand why I had that dream, cause I think my unconscious mind is trying to tell me something. But what? Any ideas?",2024-05-09 07:53:02
439,Dreams,I never dream and this nightmare terrified me,"I had a long vivid dream that felt like it lasted days i had went over to my GFs house and i overheard her stepfather talking about murdering her and i walked in as he was saying this , he pulled out the pistol i know he has on his desk and started telling me he was gonna **** me i had to beg for him to stop and i wouldn’t ever tell anyone and i ended up on my knees begging before he put away his pistol and let me go i then went to go tell my gf in this dream and tried telling her to call the police and swat and to run out of the house but in my dream she wouldn’t believe me/wanted to do anything about it and so i made it my goal to get her out of the house before anything happened i ended up a few states over at her house and begged her to leave and to call someone and my dream ended on her denying too

This dream terrified me i dont have dreams (idk why) but after years of not dreaming and this happens it terrifies me im so stressed my heart is palpitating at some points after waking up 

I told her about the dream and she said it would never happen but it still terrifies me why would i never be dreaming but suddenly have this vivid nightmare ",2024-05-09 06:49:55
440,Dreams,I just had the most realistic dream I've had,"I dont usually have vivid dreams and Ive not had any like this before.

The dream started with me just walking around a run-down but big house, everything in the house was very old-fashioned and very practically put together, like a metal sheet for a roof, stone tables, lots of plants though. I'm walking around this house extremely exhausted, like the tiredness I had in this dream was so extreme, my eyelids were way too heavy, I had to use so much will power to move my body, I was just gassed out. I find a bed with an Indonesian girl laying on one side of it and there was enough space for me to just lay there. I was contemplating whether its appropriate or not when my exhaustion just got the better of me and I just dropped and fell asleep next to her. I wake up (in the dream) and I see her above me, very scared and her hand raised with a handbag in her hand ready to smack me. She asks me what am I doing here and how did I get here. My mind is just running blanks I have no idea how to answer her, I dont know where I am nor how I got there but I actually feel super rested and calm for some reason, I ask her where am I, and consciously trying to convey how clueless I am in that moment with my expressions. Her gaurd drops a little and theres a hint of recognition of in her as if she has had a similar experience before or maybe that she understands whats happening. And then she says ""Malibu"", I ask ""Malibu?"", she smiles and becomes suddenly friendly and says ""yes Malibu"" I look around me and see the run down house more clearly, the place was actually packed with people and sort of brought to life, the people there seemed to be part of one family, not just random people, and they seemed to be getting ready to get started with work. Some details start to go missing here as I dont remember what happens next but next thing I know shes giving me a run-down of things, what they do, and suggested I should get to work with her. The rest of the dream is a blur now, I slept through the entire day at this place, learning about these people, their culture, they were the poorest of the poor, yet one of the most richest family when it came to what really mattered, they had a very strong sense of family and the air was always filled with laughter and I remember laughing so much throughout the day, everyone was working hard but very happy to be next to eachother, me and this girl developed one of the most wholesome relationships through out this day, they fed me, gave me a place to rest, and she and I would talk about our problems while working on some vegetations. She had a problem with her husband who she thought was not caring about her enough. I helped her with some male perspective on things etc. I felt so rejuvenated by the end of the dream, like I walked into the house the most exhausted I've been and by the end of the dream I felt whole in all aspects. When I woke up, I was just in awe about how realistic the dream was, and the feeling of wholeness and rejuvenation remained with me. I'm going through some really tough times and this dream was a breath of fresh air for me. I still miss her and the place and the amazing people from the dream who took life so easily while being in the worst of situations from a perspective of an outsider.",2024-05-09 06:44:08
441,Dreams,Bear attacks loved one??,"I just had a dream and I don’t remember much context but a bear attacked my little cousin. 

I assume that all of the power and technology shut down on everyone at once because we were in the car but we had to start walking. We and another family had to walk down some road that happened to be covered in leaves, twigs, other debris (so I guess a natural disaster happened) and a black bear runs across. In my mind, in my dream, I said to myself ‘thank **** it’s just a black bear’. So I tell my little cousin, my sister who’s holding his hand, and my other relative with us to not make any noise or sudden movements until the bear passes by……

AS SOON AS I FRIGGIN SAID THAT, my little cousin takes off sprinting and is of course attacked by this bear. I screamed ‘No’ so loud that I was actually screaming outside of my dream. Alarmed my boyfriend and woke myself up.

445,Dreams,The tomb of Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer ,"Okay, I know this is a strange one, but here goes. 

The other night, I had a dream in which I was exploring the ruins of ancient Rome. It was the dead of night. I descended into the deepest, darkest corners of the Roman catacombs. I knew I was forbidden to proceed but went anyway. Down in the depths was a tomb bearing the remains of none other than Rudolph the Red-Nosed Reindeer. It basically consisted of an alter upon which Rudolph's scattered bones rested. At that point I woke up feeling uneasy and disoriented. 

For those of you wondering where the **** my mind got that idea from, I have indeed been to Rome. At one point I visited the Capuchin Crypt, which bears the skeletal remains of hundreds of medieval monks. 

Also, my own grandfather (who is now thirteen years dead) accompanied me on my journey. And the 1964 Rudolph cartoon was a childhood favorite of mine. Read into all that what you will. 😕 ",2024-05-09 05:01:52
446,Dreams,Where are you,"I have been having recurring dreams for the past year or two about a guy I never met! I guess he just comes in when he feels like it or isn’t busy I guess!

He’s always watching me have weird dreams and just stand there at a distance watching like “what are you dreaming about, why and what are you doing?” I try to continue what I was doing in my dream but it feels like he’s hovering most of the time and then I get distracted and wake up!

I had a lucid dream as well where I was dancing in the air like princess Genevieve from Barbie dancing princesses and by the time I turn around he’s there just staring and admiring me at a distance! Meanwhile again I’m trying to do my own thing and I feel hovered by him once again!

Another lucid dream I was in Egypt and was flying then I had my motorbike next to me and was previously talking to people! I saw this man and he was “oh I’ll talk to *my NAME*” he tries to come up to me but then I quickly get on the bike and drive off, he was just taken aback that I did that and I thought he was gonna **** around with me!

This man is always a tall muscular lean man with long wavy blonde hair, sharp face and sometimes he has green eyes but it’s not always I can see it!

I’ve had another dream where it felt like I saw myself in the future with another guy or an event happening in/on my bed and he was like letting me see things from his perspective I guess! Soooo weird

Never met a man like this in real life Literally!!!
Especially with how he gave off an energy like he knew so much of me and my dreams/soul and also knew my name! Soooo weird!

I don’t have many more dreams of him as often but when I think my dreams are my own he just pops in and watches me, like a man watching their gf do those cute things etc! But he just pops in when he feel like it and it’s sooooo weird! Idk if it’s a spirit guide or just someone coming through if that’s even possible! ",2024-05-09 04:56:11

450,Dreams,Repeated attempts to steal my phone,"I had a dream tonight and it feels like there is a meaning behind it but google couldn’t help me and i have no clue how to interpret it.

I was walking around in Monaco (i have been there before and always felt very safe and comfortable) when i met two girls probably around my age. They asked me something like if i wanna hang out or take a picture im not sure what exactly but we started to walk around and talk. I realized that one of them was trying to get my phone which was in my jacket pocket so i held it before her and she could not take it away. She then made a joke about stealing my phone. I continued to walk around, at this point I was holding my phone in my pocket. I could still feel her trying to get it but no big attempts were made because i always noticed. After a while of us walking i bumped into a young man who was also trying to steal my phone but at this point i was very cautious. He just continued to walk in the same direction. After that i went into a electronicsshop to get a new case with a leash. I couldn’t find what i was looking for for my exact phone but it was very busy in the store and the girls were still there so i did not want to expose my phone in case i couldn’t hold it. The girls then said my phone is perfect to steal because of the age and the quality it had a good resell value without it being suspected for being stolen even without a receipt. At this point i was pretty much guarding my phone with my whole body so people wouldn’t get to it easily. At that point i went to check for my bag if i had everything and i did even though the sipper was open and my wallet was exposed. I closed it and moved on. I was still in the shop trying to find a case. As the shop got less busier and the girls weren’t near i took it out of my pocket to compare it side to side to see if it would fit. Then a friend of mine appears but didn’t notice me so i say hi then he looks up notices me and smiles. He said hi aswell. We are happy to see each other and talk about why we are here. I still had my phone but i woke up right in that conversation.

Thank you for your time reading this and hopefully someone can help me interpret this.

Ive told a couple people about my dreams and I always get the same “that’s messed up” response. Essentially I have dreams where I am a serial killer. I never actually dream that I am killing someone, it always starts afterwards. Either I am burying the bodies, or have already buried them. Then I remember that I have done this many times.

Then after this happens either police show up and are investigating looking for the people, or there is construction going on and the bodies are unburied or are potentially going to be unburied. 

I had this dream last night where I had buried 2 people under my front porch. My landlord decided to replace the porch, when they were digging they unburied the bones of someone.

Does anyone know what i'm experiencing?,"Before I start I think it might be important to note that I have had 6 concussions in my life (this is important later and is probably the cause of this.) So basically this has happened since probably my 3rd concussion (I don't remember much but I think it generally started then) Were I would have a dream it was pretty casual and normal (usually it wasn't a dream I was experiencing but watching from the sky almost like a sandbox video game) And it is a normal dream nothing scary or stress full happens but for some reason I am irritated by everything and I get a feeling of hopelessness because I know this feeling won't go away for a while and I have this physical pain in the middle of my brain and it feels like it is splitting in two, it is almost a physical pain it hurts but at the same time it doesn't but when it feel like it is splitting it also kind of feels like my sanity is also tearing away and I become very irritable (everything that happens in the dream is unbearable) and the dream doesn't end even when I wake up and go back to sleep the dream continues and it feels like I'm going crazy and it hurts. Eventually when I wake up I feel tired still and throughout the day I feel more irritable (I can't sit conftorbally, my clothes feel super unconftorbale and I get a feeling of hopelessness.) this used to happen only like once every couple months (I didn't notice these occurred because they only happened every couple months I think) when I got my 6th concussion when I was concussed I had them almost every other day and I felt like I was going crazy and afterward (been about 4 months since) I have them every week or two.

459,Dreams,How would you describe what a dream feels like? Imagine trying to do it someone who couldn't dream somehow ,"Hi everyone 

Kind of had this random thought over the past few days. We all know what it feels like but how could you explain it in language. What does the feeling of 'dream-like' actually mean. Just an extremely weird series of events, that at the time seem to make total sense. But I always feel like there is a kind of 'fog' to everything that you're not entirely aware of but it is there, although maybe you only realise this with hindsight? I'm not sure. 'Fog' also might be the wrong word. Sometimes they are literally quite foggy but I mean more this kind of subconscious feeling of surrealness I guess. Although as I said I'm not actually sure whether you realise this in the dream or only when you wake up

They're actually so difficult to describe ",2024-05-09 01:13:41

I personally I'm grateful for having these experiences and I love to explore them, the only thing I'm missing are nightmares, last time I had a nightmare was when I was about 10yo and I don't really remember the feeling of them.

461,Dreams,A serial killer was obsessed with me,"I had a dream about walking into a crime scene, which was the floor above mine in my apartment, while the killer was still there and he noticed me when I was trying to stay hidden and climb the stairs down to my floor. He gave me a smile, then I ran away from him as fast as I could. I escaped him, temporarily. Everyone knew that he was a lunatic and that he committed the ****, but no one did anything, it felt like everyone was scared of him. I encountered him a few more times and he was kind of getting obsessed with me and following me. The scene changed to me sobbing because of stress in front of an old abandoned ruin of a temple. My teeth were falling out because of the stress and there was blood but apparently that was a normal sign of extreme stress in my dream world. My mother was watching from a distance, feeling bad for me. Then my dad came up to me and hugged me, he told me that he is there for me and that everything is going to be alright (he is emotionally unavailable and not affectionate in real life). After that we booked a flight and moved to Australia to escape the serial killer who was obsessed with me but didn't want to **** me, or atleast it seemed that way. At the airport I felt like something was wrong and I told my mom that but she didn't believe me and said, ""Everything is fine, we're in Australia now."" And I let go of it for that moment. Then after sometime as we were going through the customs at the airport, I see him disguised as a worker giving me a creepy smile. I woke up after that. What's funny is that my father showing me affection was more surprising to me than being chased by a serial killer. 

Anyway, what could this dream mean and signify?",2024-05-09 01:00:02

I had a dream involving something akin to a show I guess or something.

Except it's a reality tv show or sorta semi reality-

Me,friend 1 and friend 2 are out and about.

I don't remember all the details.



Just the ending-



There were monsters at this town where we were taking a vacation, yet we thought it was only living in the water so the group went to our hotel (?) room-



The doorbell rang. I thought it was going to be the food delivery when i went to open the door-



It was actually a monastery of nuns who came to tell us that they did like a spiritual barrier to protect the home from the town.





Because there was an invincible monster that most can't defeat :

Which was death.



No seriously the reaper just came into the house in like a speed motion,

Cracked the first friend's neck so fast that she just fell to the floor. 



 I was next.



I closed my eyes, 

I heard the impact.



I woke up.",2024-05-09 00:59:07
463,Dreams,I just lived a life that i thought was real for around a year. Now im questioning reality ,"Hey 

I don’t use reddit at all; in fact i just made this account because i need help or feedback or something idk i just want to talk about it with someone.

To add some context, i (16M) have been struggling in my relationship as both me and my girlfriend have been losing the spark we initially had in the beginning. To add to that, i have been getting around only 4 hours of sleep every day for a while now due to procrastination with work and exams coming. Idk if that has increased my stress since i was never someone to really bother about grades (my parents put the pressure). I would also like to add that i am in a boarding school so i am all alone here in terms of family. 

So i went to sleep at 1am today which isn’t too late for me considering my recent sleep schedule. To begin with, my dream started like any do, not realizing it actually started. I don’t remember much from then but i remember that i lived in some weird reality version of where i live back in _ with my family. All i remember is that some military group had began advertising some type of simulation training that consisted of you being put in the simulation without realizing it. You would not be able to escape it until you actually realized you were in the simulation and the best way to describe what it looked like in the advertising is that everything went white and the outline or everything you were looking at became a long sharp spike of pixels that were black. There you would be greeted and rewarded for having been able to escape but the military group. Again i don’t remember the specific details but for whatever it led to my father sending me here (on good terms like if i wanted to). The military camp was based in Miami and i remember arriving in the airport where many “homeless” people were staying. There are small details that made it so realistic that i can mention if you want to know that made it seem so real. I remember that on my way there i went with my girlfriend where we had bonded like we hadn’t in a while until having arrived to Miami. The airport looked like **** though basically like a military base looking rusty metallic and old. All i remember is falling asleep in the airport i assume where i woke up like nothing happened and i was just living my life like normal like if i hadn’t even gone to the military camp and i was immediately arriving back to my home country where my family was. Visually, my house had already changed and something was definitely off, even for me in the dream. Every building was colorful like a Simpson episode and generally looked different to what my local area back at home looks like but i have had my home look exactly like that before in other dreams. I remember running to my house out of excitement when to see my family like if a long period of time had passed when i spotted my old roommate which had been expelled a while back (irl) for getting caught with rolling **** in our own boarding room. I have had many dreams about him before as we are on (really) bad terms due to an old situation that happened a few weeks after he left my boarding school. I regret what i did in that situation and i know that my constant dreams of him serve as a reminder for my regret. I went to talk to him, but like many other dreams i have had, we pretended like nothing happened. Now that a lot of time had passed, i saw that everyone i new including my brother had physically changed. Past classmates (before boarding) i knew who i never really think of were in my living room doing something like watching or playing something in the tv. Again, the best way to describe it is that i was in some type of Simpsons looking house. I rushed to my room to see if it had been renovated as well along with that old friend of mine where i just stumbled to more people in my room where i finally saw my mom who quickly commented on how that friend had being going the gym and getting big while i was still a twig. Also this is really weird but every time he flexed he went from being a short white scrawny American ican to resembling a younger latino friend i had. She didn’t necessarily say it rudely but it came off as condescending. I remember straight up telling her to shut up (which isn’t like me) before a gap where i woke up once again like my life had gone back to normal in boarding. 

Once again, something was off, but rather in terms of the architecture of the school and the best way to put it is that it looked like what i thought it would before coming here. Every day i lived my life normally. With my girlfriend; and everything wasn’t just getting better but i was finally happy again and it felt like i had restored the spark in our relationship. Every single say got better and it finally felt like i was finally happy again. I don’t remember every detail of every single say but i remember the time passing like if it actually did. 

All of this happiness continued until one random day around a month to a year later when was i a class and i remembered out of nowhere about the military simulation experience which immediately caused me to notice every single sign that i was in a simulation for the past year (or the time that had passed) or so. I began to think about how to escape the simulation and the best way to put it was that i made this painful self squeeze to my own body along with my belly where identically to the military advertisements, everything went white and my surrounding classmates shifted into those same long spikes of black pixels i had seen before. I woke up surrounded by soldiers like im the advertisement with a female scientist standing around 5 meters before me in an empty field that was closed off by metallic walls in a circle with soldiers surrounding me from the front. I can’t exactly remember but also like in the advertisements i was chained to the floor. I was congratulated and let out for me to check my phone and realize that the last photo i had taken on my phone was one of my girlfriend the day i had arrived to the Miami airport. In this “real world” 1 month passed and i felt misled by the military even though this was what i had signed up for. I searched the only real thing i remembered which was my travel bag and used searched it desperately to convince myself that not much time was passed. Now, the feeling of this airport felt even worse then before, the best way to explain it was that it felt like there was some type of negative energy surrounding wherever i went and i noticed that the place i had slept in now looked like a **** once again full of homeless people that overlooked a some type of backrooms pools looking water stream. I don’t remember the airport but i remember being greeted by my friends in this now dystopian looking version of everything i had previously seen. All i wanted to do was talk to my girlfriend but no matter what i did she wouldn’t answer me when i messaged her. I explored this dystopian looking version of my previous memory of how the world looked where i revisited my boarding school for it also look dystopian and ran by road men i know?I remember walking down to leave the campus when i got a call back where my friend, who i have suspected may be into her (irl), sat next to her, along with a bunch of apocalyptic survivor emo looking people i had never seen before sat behind them in a weirdly structured dark blue bus. I did not recognize my girlfriend one bit as she had fully changed from a perfect blonde Swedish girl to a latina looking girl with long black hair and heavy amounts of makeup. I asked her what happened and my “friend” in the bus answered me by saying she got bored where she expanded on that by saying that 1 month was too long for her to wait. At first i felt heartbroken, until i realized that my girlfriend wasn’t like that, which to me provedd it wasn’t her.

Something told me i was still in the simulation which led to an infinite feeling loop of me thinking i escaped the simulation for real for it to just be another one, each with a different story to what happened, some being relieving as in not that much time had passed to other(s) being stressing this went on for around 2-4 simulations until i finally made it out, where i woke up to what i swear was Nicholas Hoult as Lex Luther who i had previously seen as a ceo or director of this simulation military tryout event that was happening. Remembering now at least in one of those simulations that i escaped had involved me defeating or confronting Nicholas Hoult as the military ceo. I woke up up in an advanced looking coffin that resembled those pods from the matrix. They even looked a little Egyptian since the material looked to be something like lime or sand stone. Nicholas Hoult disappeared due to me to somehow either defeating him. The  place i was in was hard to tell of an origin as everything looked destroyed, but one thing i can say i remember was that instead of being surrounded by an airport it was the middle of a closed, cemetery looking field that had many surrounding greek pillars that also sat next to some sort of garden i remember going up to the garden to explore where i wast chased by a hoard of bees and wasps as this garden seemed to be some sort of honey farm. I was only stung by only one bee, which in real life, i have never been stung by. Since i have never been stung i have this recurring fear of being allergic to bee stings which ended the dream off with me looking at my hands and realizing they had swollen. In this dream sequence.

Many other things happened like being touched by a girl my age while unconscious and many more weird things that i have never really experienced before, but i think it’s fair to say i have given enough detail unless you would like to know more.

There is a lot of psychological things i can decipher from my dream that can show my current mental state but one thing for sure is that this dream helped me realize how much i really loved my girlfriend when all i could think about was her. It occurred during a period of 3 hours yet felt like a year. I don’t know if this was a sign from ****. I genuinely don’t know what can explain why i suddenly had a dream that included so much emotion and events, but it left me in a puddle of sweat and shaking for the first hour after waking up.

Any ideas on what this dream could mean?

I had really terrible nightmares as a kid, would wake up screaming a lot. Sleep paralysis, night terrors and all. About two years ago, around the time that I went through something very traumatic and was also diagnosed with schizophrenia, I stopped having dreams altogether. I go to sleep and it's just nothing and then I'm awake again. I'm not sure if it was the trauma that did it or the schizophrenia as I aged into it, or if it's just something that comes and goes but I've wondered a lot. I kind of miss dreaming, so I just wonder what happened and if it's something I can fix 🤔

It started off with me sitting in a small room on my toilet looking out my window. I saw 2 really big moon looking things in the night sky, there was also a smaller one but idk where it went. These 2 massive things, like I’m talking covering atleast 2/10 of the sky each, collided with each other and kinda warped together a bit before slowly disappearing and revealing what looked like 2 differently coloured small (a little smaller than moon size) blackhole looking things but I think they were meant to be stars. Anyway they collided and exploded and this glittery stardust just went everywhere and it was gorgeous. Then it all got **** in and turned into a proper black hole which instantly grew absolutely massive covering the entire sky

470,Dreams,The killer whales are back,"Ever since I was a little kid I was different from other kids, I was a bit of a loner and got bullied and picked on a lot. I used to go to the ocean a lot and just stare at the waves. I also had this weird thing where animals would just come to me. Like over a dozen times wild animals have walked up to me and just sat on me or near me sniffed me etc. Manatees, dolphins, bears, deer, birds, foxes, etc.

When I was 6-12 I used to dream very regularly about befriending killer whales, one in particular that would come to me when I waded into the water. The whale would take me away from my island and we would go swimming around the world to Greenland.

Over the years every once in a while the killer whale would come back to my dreams once she had a daughter I befriended her as well.

The dream is always I am walking with people or alone near the ocean and I go to the water and call out (aquaman style) and the killer whale comes back (must be like 40 by now lol).

Two nights ago the killer whale came back when I called her, I was my adult self and was walking with my now family in my dream. The whale had a very large red gash or scar on its underside belly. She was bleeding. She also had a son with her and she was ok as far as I could see just tired, weary. I apologized I hadn’t come to her in so long…

471,Dreams,I feel like it may mean something. Any ideas? ,"Hello everyone, I am new here because I have to tell someone about this dream I have been having repeatedly for the past few weeks. 

The dream always starts with me being individually by myself or with a group of people and around a large sum of water (big lake/ocean). In this dream I am walking and there is this green creature (puts me in the reminder of a dragon) that crawls up from the water to talk to me or the group I am with. This creature/dragon usually always asks me a question of some sort. If I am nice to the creature and the others around me are nice to this creature then it will leave me alone and will go back into the big sum of water. If the group or me are mean or upset the creature in anyway, it will go back into the sum of water and wait until it sees me again to fully attack and bite me and pull me into the water. This is when the creature would still be biting me while pulling me into the dark depths of the lake or ocean.


I find this dream to be a little unsettling but I cannot help to have a feeling it means more. Any ideas would be appreciated! ",2024-05-08 22:16:57
472,Dreams,Okay I'm so lost on what this dream means. If anybody has any thoughts or interpretations please anything is welcomed....,"So, in my dream, I'm fleeing, trying to stay away from a sort of lover per-say. They're people helping me through this house that is all distorted, and the walls are tall and furniture much larger than normal size. The man I'm running from is literally nobody I know. He doesn't even have a face, really, but I'm deeply in love with him. Halfway through this dream, I realize I am pregnant, and because the real me is third person, I can tell that the small bump I have is this man's child.

Now understand I have a soft fear that if he finds me something bad may happen, but that's only because these people are strongly protecting me like I'm something precious. I eventually make it into this kitchen. Sort of room and the room is normal looking as far as size and purposes. I can feel when this man comes close to me, so I know he's in the surrounding area somewhere. I feel so desperate to be with him, so connected to him that I want to break free of this ban of people trying to keep me away from him. He was so feral, and it was extremely attractive how much he wanted me in his presence. I could feel his anger from not being able to find me, so much so it made me angry I was being kept from him. It was this aggravating game of cat and mouse, but he was a lion, and I was his mate bearing his cub. The bond between us was so strong, and it made my entire body ache over the need to be with him. 

Suddenly, the dream shifts, and I'm on a porch attached to a small home, and he's still searching for me. I can feel it. He's close. A woman was there with me on the porch trying to push me in the house, but I wouldn't go in with her, I wanted him to find me. I wanted him all around me in many different ways. Then I woke up to reality, never knowing what would have happened when I finally was within his reach. I know I probably wrote a whole book. Please forgive me. I just want to know so bad what this dream meant.

Idk if this matters but I'm single, and the only romantic type incidents I've had in 5 years is, a guy about 6-8 years older than me would call me pretty eyes and mention how big they were. I know him because our dads are friends,but only recently, a couple of months ago, did he ever even speak to me other than maybe 3 words the entire time we've know each other. He is handsome, and I wouldn't mind even entertaining the idea of getting closer to him, but I have no feelings for him. I barely know him. He just has this really dominant way about him that kind of freezes me up when he speaks to me. 

I haven't talked to him in over a month and barely even thought about him so I don't know if this dream is because of him or if im just dreaming up some wild mess in my boring mind

476,Dreams,Weirdest/Disturbing Dream ,"Last night, I fell asleep and woke up in my world. Every time I dream, no matter what. I am stuck in this world that's a mash up of locations I lived in. The locations are extremely close to each other irl. Some locations added that  I never been too and it's always the exact same. 


Different occurrences happen, but the layout is the same. 
A very vivid dream last night, my grandpa was driving me somewhere, and we stopped at the gas station. I run in to use the bathroom, and come out and he's gone. In fact this has never happened, it's usually a normal place. Never unexpected turns. All the traffic was gone, no cars. Extremely quiet. 

I am in the middle of the city btw, so it's odd.
I turn around and there's this grotesque looking entity. 
We stare at each other before he speaks and he asks me if i want to make a deal, I can't remember exactly what I said to him. But he told me that the deal was that I could stay in this world forever. 
I could control everything: events, where I want to go, what I want to eat, experience everything I've EXPERIENCED.
He made that clear - only things I've experienced in the real life I could only experience here.


 The only drinks, food, environments, drugs, etc that I've experienced in real life I could only experience  here in my dream world. However in this world there were so many places and environments that I never experienced so that was a plus. But this dream world definitely has boundries, it's always locked in area.

Basically in exchange for him to transfer his consciousness to my body, and I could stay here and do whatever I want, but like I said above its somewhat limited. He said everyone who knows you in your life wouldn't bat an eye, I would be your mimic. Again I don't remember what I said, but I remember him calling me a **** and I woke up in sleep paralysis. Very short. And woke up.


I know this probably isn't anything, but in dreams terms what could this mean?

477,Dreams,It felt so real.,"This was in 2020. My dream starts off in what looked like a military ghost town. I was cruising with some people. This girl and I go off somewhere. These guys come up to us and start a convo. They ask to hang out. We say why not, and get to know each other. My friend is with a guy she’s going for and I’m with another. The guy I’m with and I went to explore these weird apartments, up and down spiralling staircases. It was dark. Obviously wasn’t his place. Technically we were breaking and entering. The energy felt extremely off. We end up going outside and my friend doesn’t agree to what this guy says. He grabs her from behind, jumps backwards off the deck, then turns around so she hits her head off the pavement. He just killed her right in front of me ...I was so shocked. I stayed silent. I didn’t know what to do. I just looked at the guys like “the ****”. I tried to not appear intimidated. I made some comment, thinking I was protecting myself and prayed I wasn’t next. I tried so hard to act unfazed. But then the guy on the ground got up, and stared into my soul. His buddies started walking towards me. I casually walked further into these abandoned houses trying to act cool and pretend as if I was gonna show them something I found?. Then I book it towards some back door. I get lost as this house is confusing as ****. I finally make it outside. I glance to my left. This light skinned guy with a beard and slim face with a black hood up is waiting for me. He grins and has a gun aimed right at me. He doesn’t even give me a chance. I turn around to jump the railing on the deck in the back yard. That’s when he shoots. Round after round. To this day I recall the sound of the gun shots, followed by bullets piercing through my skull. He shot me four times. I fell into the ground. Suffering. They run away as they hear sirens. I’m lying on the concrete trying to yell for help. It’s so hard. My mouth gets dry, then really wet. With blood and foam. My mouth is filled and I start gagging. I spit it out as much as possible but I’m in so much pain I can barely move. I begin to cry. “This is how I die, I’m going to f***ing die.” I try calling my mom. She doesn’t answer. I call my bestfriend. I can barely speak. It’s so hard for me to spit out words. I explain I got shot , and I needed help. My voice was raspy, and fading. She laughs and says ,”nice prank (my name).” I scream. I’m so frustrated. I hang up. I start walking down and around the streets. Barely able to stay up. I find people. I ask for help. Everyone ignores me. I try calling 911 but everyone just ignored me. I go to my aunties and I remember she lived close. I tell her I was shot in the head and needed help. She doesn’t believe me considering I’m walking and well. I don’t know what came over me but I can walk properly, yet my head was killing me. She grabs my hair and pulls it up so she can get a better look. It hurts so bad from the blood drying and sticking to my hair. She grabs a mirror and shows me the back of my head. Sure enough there is four bullet holes. Gushing blood. She just leaves it and tells me to go to the hospital. I’ve never been in so much pain. Even outside of my dream my head was hurting. The dream felt so real. It’s 10:03am and the back of my head where one of the bullets went through was actually bleeding and pulsing. The rest of my dream I basically try going to the hospital but i just can’t. I end up sitting down somewhere. Looking around, taking in the world. I can feel my breath shortening even more now, it’s hard to concentrate. Everything goes silent, my vision goes blurry. My last thought was, “I’m sorry momma. I tried“. And once that sentence ended in my mind everything went black and my life had ended too. My eyes shot open and I was…calm? Wasn’t sweating, heart rate was steady too. This isn’t the first experience either. ",2024-05-08 20:48:47
478,Dreams,Disappear,"I often wonder if anyone would notice if I quietly went missing. Softly resigning from life. Slowly eliminating any trace of what’s left of me from their minds and ultimately erasing myself from memory completely. I’m not who I was five years ago. I’m even less of who I was two years prior. When I look in the mirror I only see a stranger who’s wearing the face of a man who once existed. But I do not recognize the reflection in the mirror. I burden others with my inability to cope. I wasn’t always this way, they say. Truthfully I’ve just always been a great actor. But the show is coming to an end. The relief I feel knowing they will find peace in my absence serves as my conviction of my action. 
So I will disappear without warning and though I will be missed and mourned, my absence will ultimately ease their troubled conscious. My infinite silence will quiet their limited contentions. Finally a restful sleep.

482,Dreams,Concerning dream,"I Just came back from school and decided to take a quick nap, the dream was placed in a theater and I noticed that it was closing, I was with my two younger sisters and we were just about to leave when these three girls showed up, didn't bother to ask for names so I will put ages, 17, 16 and 15. They seemed to be siblings and I don't why but I completely forgot about the exit and soon we were trapped, the exit of the theater disappeared. The three girls tried to find another way out and went through the employee door. When me and my sisters followed them the atmosphere changed and I felt like danger was near. Weirdly the more doors we went through, the dimmer it got. After the 4th door, I heard a noise and was scared shitless, the room got dark and we all started running, the 17th year old tried to leave us on that room and pushed her back, sadly she took little sister with her. I couldn't think straight, heart was beating intensly, all I could do was grab my baby sister and run, run as fast as I could, too scared to look back, I could hear the creature getting louder and louder and gradually gaining momentum. When we got to the last door, I closed it shut. The other girls was crying in the corner, and I knew that we were dead. So I told my baby sister to keep her head on my chest and I just waited for the monster to arrive. It was hard to describe because my head was off my body the next second. Last thing I  heard was my sister's dying scream. P.S, this was my second time having a dream why my siblings die in front of me and being powerless to stop it. Short summary of the first time: I was walking my baby sister in her stroller when a random stabbed her and killed me before I could react.",2024-05-08 20:13:15

I was at this store ****, kind of like a mall and an outlet. But instead of it being a long **** of stores and the parking lot, it was stores on both sides like a big hallway. So imagine an outdoor mall. All of these stores were showbiz pizzas, Chuck E. Cheese’s, and Freddy fazbears pizzas. I am not a fnaf fan really but I do collect Chuck E. Cheese and showbiz pizza stuff and go to rare Chuck E. Cheese’s. Now the thing about these places is that they were all bootleg, kind of like those weird krusty krab bootlegs in foreign countries.  Me and my family only went inside one and that was the weird bootleg Chuck E. Cheese (one of many on the ****.) inside was what you would expect from a Chuck E. Cheese except the animatronics were weird bootleg characters that were very strange. It was a bunch of rats and mice one of which who had a giant head. There was also a tiny spiderman animatronic and a bunch of other weird blurry things on stage.

490,Dreams,I have dreams about climbing up an eroding ledge on a beach,"When the dream starts, I'm near or at the top of a roughly 60 foot ledge, climbing it. As the earth gives way, I plummet to the bottom and it hurts like **** on the Sandy beach, but I survive without injuries. Because of this, I continue scaling the ledge over and over again, each time either falling to the bottom or reaching the top and then actually choosing to jump back down because I know it's survivable (or because there's an even greater threat waiting for me at the top and I have to escape them). However, each time I'm up there and either hanging on for my life or jumping, I'm also deathly scared that I'd been lucky up to this point and this kind of fall could absolutely **** me easily.

I've had this dream at least 30 times over the last 6-10 years and it got to the point where I'd have memories of this cliff as if it was a real memory and I've even started to tell people about it as if it happened, before catching myself and being really confused. 

My questions are: 1)Anyone have similar experiences? And 2) What are your interpretations of this? And of recurring dreams, in general, as that's definitely not a normal occurrence for me. 

I'm 38M and a dad and a husband, btw.

491,Dreams,Fever nightmare,"this was quite a few years ago. i was at home for about 2 days before this nightmare happened. I had a pretty strong fever for several days. on that day, i remember sitting on my chair, still with a fever, i was on my phone. i dont know if i fell asleep on that chair, or not, i do not remember closing my eyes or falling asleep. after a while, i stood up and sat into an armchair in our living room. pretty soon after sitting, my vision started blurring, and slowly transitioned into me seeing just white. i remember screaming, and then feeling my head explode. not in a bloody way, just a bright explosion. i then zoned out for a bit as far as i know, and then stood up, as if nothing happened, and went outside to our garden. at this point i still dont realize whats dream and whats reality. the teo are almost blurred together. i dont remember falling asleep, or waking up. anyways. later that day i went to bed. and had no nightmares, still had a fever tho. in the morning i woke up and went to our kitchen, where my mom was. when she saw me, she told me that i went into the kitchen earlier that night, at around 12am, and i apparently started repeatedly saying that peoples heads are exploding. i apparently freaked out like that for about 10 minutes and then she managed to get me  back into bed. to this day this is the strangest dream experience ive ever had, because i still have no idea when i was dreaming, and when i wasnt. i was obviously dreaming when the whole explosion of my head happened, but when did i fall asleep? how much of that day was just a lie? i guess ill never know, and i think about it to this day",2024-05-08 17:16:58
492,Dreams,Americas judgement ,"America is Mystery Babylon in Revelation chapter 17 and 18. The judgement on america is very soon ive been having dreams since June 2023 of fire falling from the sky and a map of america burning. In one dream there was big black tornados severe lightning and fire falling from the sky and in the dream i said to all the people around “get ready the rapture is about to happen!” Heard someone on youtube had a dream like mine of the map of america getting caught on fire. One girl had a dream of people burnig and she could smell their flesh in the dream. This is very serious gods been telling me this happens soon man. But he of course raptures people first out of it before he burns when he says I forget the verse ""come out of her my people unless you be partakers of her sins"" just the other day had a vision of 6 big black tornadoes and saw the words ""warn people"" so that's what I'm trying to do. I do in no way think I'm holier then anyone and have my own issues I need to work out but now is the time to turn from your sins. Gods been warning not only me but tons of people. Just search on YouTube about ""Americas judgement"" or ""America mystery babylon"" search on here all the dreams people have of fire and a big storm coming and destruction happening and the rapture. All these people having these dreams are Americans. but don't just believe what anyone says blindly including myself. Take it to **** ask him to give you a dream about if what I'm saying is true or not. He will cause **** gives us dreams. I've asked him for specific dreams about stuff before and that vet night I will dream about what I asked about.  This is not a conspiracy it is indeed fact cause it's what the bible says in revelation 17 and 18. Just was looking for other places to share this. You have to read the chapters 17 and 18 of revelation to see what it says it's too much to share on here but talks about how **** destroys mystery Babylon with fire. Its refered to as ""that great city"" but see they didn't have countires back then only big cities but its referring to all of america. Gods told me this and common since if you read those chapters.

The bible talks about how in the last days people will have dreams... If you don't believe dreams are from **** then you dont believe the bible

494,Dreams,A ride to remember.,"I haven't written anything down for almost a week, which is my limit. I set my intentions on immersing myself a bit more for my Live Chat on r/Lucid_Experiences.

Log: 118

This next experience was a fun one.

I'm on a train with my wife. It was built similarly to a subway train but had lots of walking space. It was dark outside. There's pine trees for miles. As I'm looking outside the window, I catch my wife in he reflection. 

I smile and turn to her. *""Isn't this great? Traveling the country together, I mean.""* 

She smiles gracefully. *""I wouldn't want to do this with anyone but you.""*

Quite subtlety, a noise on the right catches my attention. It's faint but sounds like low radio chatter. 

*"".o..t .o i.. sh.. n.. .e.l.""* 

I focus in on it a bit harder and manage to hear a small voice inside my ear. 

*""Don't do it. She's not real.""* 

I become partly lucid and reply using my mind's eye, *""Hello? What do you mean?""*

The voice chimes in again, *""Get off the train! This isn't real! I don't have much time to explain!""*

Having this slight awareness, I acknowledge the dream and walk toward the front of the train. Before I get to the conductor, my wife walks to me, but she isn't my wife anymore. She has turned into a random woman, her face and figure unfamiliar. 

I exclaim, *""Get away from me! You aren't her...""* 

She becomes visibly irritated. She then grabs my left hand and tries to eat it. I move my ring over the spot where her teeth are going to chomp down. Her face becomes visibly angry. I will the cabin door open and force her out with my thoughts. She flies out as if being punched in the chest and disappears behind the train, presumably left behind. The thought of her is gone now. 

I continue to the front of the train. I motion to the conductor. 

*""I know this isn't our stop, but I need to step off.""* 

The train slows down enough to hop off safely. After stepping on the fresh grass, I notice that I'm ****. It isn't as concerning as it would normally be, but I want to feel comfortable, so I take in my surroundings to look for a solution.

There's a restaurant just up ahead. I tread on over, dangly bits and all. The crowd is dominantly black. My skin is as white as it can get. I feel unnoticed, though. I ask various constructs for a pair of underwear. No one can oblige. I then find the host. 

I calmly explain, *""Hey, my dude. I'm just in and need some clothes. Do you have, at least, some underwear I can have?""* 

He gives me a smug look as he hands me a large table cloth. It's silk white with golden-tan trim. 

He smerks and says, *""This place isn't for your kind. You might wanna get outa here.""* 

With absolute confidence, I deliver my thoughts, *""I may not have grown up around black people, but tell me this. Aren't you still human?""* 

He is impressed by my response. He extends his hand for a very particular handshake and bro-hug. 

I wake up shortly after.",2024-05-08 16:51:38
495,Dreams,Fun with constructs,"I thought y'all might enjoy this one.

Log: 120

I keep thinking back on another lucid moment. I played along with the narrative, mostly. I'm in a bar with a group of people. It feels natural, so I stay with it. I recall, in a prior experience, that I had regressed a construct into a coma for being a bit too rowdy. He looks dead, basically. 

I look over at the gentleman and ask, *""Didn't I bring him back already?""*

Frozen like a mummified corps, he manages to mumble, *""Vo. Voo viviv.""*

I couldn't understand him very well. I reply, *""I did?""*

Again, he mumbles. I focus in. *""VO!""*

Surprised that I left him that way for so long, I reply, *""Oh! Okay. Here you go.""*

With a courtious roll of the wrist, I gesture with my right hand and submit my intentions. His color turns from pale blue to a natural and lively tone. 

He takes a deep breath and sighs, *""Ooooooh, yeaaaaah. That's better.""*

We converse a bit. I ask him, *""What was it like in there?""*

He smiles and says, *""Amazing. I could do anything I wanted in there. I missed the taste of Flaming Brousch, though. Oh! Let's go get some!""*

I follow him to a table at the back of the bar. There are a couple of people already there, but they're all acquainted. Expecting a tasty dish, he hands me a bottle of peppermint ****. 

I look at it for a moment, then proclaim my dedication to the flavor, *""Focus on your best memory of it and send it to ****!""*

I purse my lips and down a hefty swig. The flavor was *electric*. I slowed my perception of time to take in the moment. As I fall to my back within these moments, imperceptible, *rich overtones* fill my senses. *Creamy and bold* lay the foundation for the contradictory *flames of peppermint*. It washes away with an *aftertaste of sweet rum*, aged in maple wood, wafting through the nostrils. Before I hit the ground, my vision fades back to base reality. 

I'm not much of a drinker, to be honest. It's amazing what the mind is capable of. This level of immersion can not be matched.",2024-05-08 16:45:36

499,Dreams,What’s the meaning of this dream? ,"I was with two random people and my brother outside somewhere next to a beach like surrounding talking. It seemed to be darker outside. While we were talking I kept feeling like I heard something but just brushed it off. This happened a lot of times. It felt like almost an hour went by at this point. Until finally I heard it. It said July 18. 

I turned to look and it turns out it was something that was extremely hard to see. It was very small. It was human like with wings flying. 

It started to leave once it got my attention. So I followed it all the way to a massive body of water that i assumed was a beach. It started to fly out into the water. So I followed it and when I started to walk onto the water. There was an invisible walkway that lit up with every step I took. 

When I looked back the two random people were with me. My brother wasn’t with us but I didn’t realize it at this point. 

I continued to follow this thing out onto the water and it led me to something that I can’t explain. It almost seemed like a portal type of thing. When I got to it I didn’t go to another place. Instead I turned into the thing I was following. 

I turned into an angel. So that whole time it was an angel trying to talk to me. And it led me to this thing that turned me into an angel. The two random people with me turned into angels too. 

At this point I realized my brother was not with us. I started to feel worried and that time was running out. I felt like the world was going to end really soon. As fast as I could I flew to my brother. 

I found my brother and I was trying to talk to him but he couldn’t see me or hear me. I kept trying and trying but he just couldn’t hear me. 

This is when I realized. In the very beginning I couldn’t hear or see the angel that was trying to talk to me. It took me forever to finally hear it say July 18th In the quietest voice. 

Once I made the realization that I am now an angel. It seemed it was extremely hard, almost impossible for humans to see or hear angels. 

At this point I woke up. For some reason this date seemed so significant and important. 

I don’t know what this means. 

Why was it so hard to hear or see the angel?

Why was this date so significant July 18 and why did the Angel tell it to me. 

Why was it impossible for my brother to hear or see me now that I’m an angel. 

I woke up before I could help my brother get there. I wanted to save him. I wanted him to be an angel too. Sadly I woke up tho. 

When I woke up I was overwhelmed with emotions and couldn’t help but repeat this date July 18 over and over. I wrote it all down so I would remember it. 

For some reason this dream felt like it had such a significant meaning. 

I almost felt like I should tell everybody that something significant is going to happen on July 18.

501,Dreams,Strange Dream/Life Coincidence,"Hello, I decided to join this community after experiencing something strange last night. My dreams tend to be either very bizarre, or some mix of interests I find entertaining. I rarely have have nightmares anymore since training myself to quickly wake up. 

Last night, I dreamed I was in an unfamiliar home. It was still my home if that makes sense. I was at a computer and that was the only ambient light. It was night and very dark. To my left were slider doors to the outside. Outside I could make out a scary silhouette. Upon closer inspection, I realized it was a dark entity that was interested in me. It wanted to get inside. I was scared, but I was not waking up like what happens with my nightmares.  

I confronted the entity under the moonlight. It was a short, shadowy, humanoid figure. I attempted to fight it, but nothing worked. It did not do anything but stand there. 

I felt very worried, and decided to seek out aid. I called a spirit medium in the dream who told me it was a demon, but it held no power over me. They instructed me to inform the entity of this. It soon disappeared. I should note the medium was hard to decipher, like they were reaching out great distance to contact me.  

My dreaming soon become normal and fun. However, this is where things get very odd. In the morning when I woke up, my brother informed me he had called the police around 3:00 AM because he was scared of something outside his room. His room has slider doors that connect to a patio that leads outside. He had heard something moving around. 

The police informed him that they did not find anything, and the stairs up to the patio had cobwebs. Nobody had gone up them in quite some time. I felt this experience was very strange. My backyard is swampland, and is spooky at night. 

For additional context, my grandfather had once told me that he dreamed of a pig farm burning, and the next day discovered a pig farm HAD actually burned near his home. 

Does anyone here have insight on this? It would put my mind at ease to know if people have experienced similar things. Thank you for reading this.

502,Dreams,Horrible nightmare of strangling mice. Why me?  What does this mean? ,"I just woke up from a horrible nightmare, in which, I purposely tortured two mice. I feel like a terrible person.



There was no blood in the nightmare. There were originally 4 mice which I think I was supposed to take care of because of some strange organization asked me to. I succesfully did this and afterwards they eventually gave me only two mice. 

  
The organization threatened me that because of the importance of these mice, my house could get bombed by an enemy organization through airstrikes.... needless to say that this makes no sense whatsoever. 

**These 2 mice, noted, these were very small and vulnerable. One of them I put in an empty cup of coffee that kind of froze the mice, however I started giving it some water, so that it could warm up a little bit, after that it was super tame, calm and still and quiet, I eventually gave it something to eat too (cheese) since I liked this behaviour, and then it just stayed still and in the nightmare I was satisfied that it stayed still. Then I grabbed the little mice by the upper part of the neck with two fingers and began to tighten the hold which in turn made the mice bit me sometimes and yell. Eventually I held this mice and began strangling it by holding it inside my hand and suffocating it. I stopped and left it on the floor. It was again, very still, shaking terrified and could not move.** 

  
The second mice was in a darkened plastic bag, it was not frozen. With this one, I directly started strangling it by holding it inside my hand, but this one was more resistant, it bit me multiple times, it made me super uncomfortable. Eventually I weakened it by the strangle hold and so I left him on the floor while I was grabbing it and got it close to the first mice. So why did I want the first mice  to interact with this second one? I wanted to teach the second mice (which in the dream for some reason I knew they were friends)  how calm the first mice was, so the second mice in front of the first mice, it licked it a little bit and smelled its partner's nose, the first one was just standing still and shaking all wet.



The second mice, because I thought I could manipulate it into thinking that it also had to stay still, wiggled around the floor into the back of my room, I remember catching it, but its will could not be broken, so it escaped into the back of my closet, and I could not find it again. 

  
The dream ends. What could this possibly mean? Btw I don't drink, smoke or do medications. I am completely saddened I would dream something so wicked. ",2024-05-08 15:29:51

512,Dreams,Am I crazy? Future events in dreams.,"All my life, I've had dreams a handful of times per year where I see something out of context (usually mundane) and then, years later, experience something in the waking world exactly as it was in the dream. When the recollection happens, it almost always is accompanied by extreme deja vu, dizziness, and nausea. All symptoms pass within seconds, but usually cause me to have to stop and catch my breath.

Example: 
In my early 20s, I had a vivid, short dream where I was walking down a cream-colored hallway, with dark wooden trim and doors. Some doors were open and some were shut. Fluorescent light flooded everwhere. Smelled like recently mopped Pine-sol, but not quite. I knew I wasn't alone (I could hear people in some of the rooms, but couldnt understand them), but there was an unease to the whole place - like a low-grade mixture of anxiety and excitement. As I got near the end of the hallway (it had a distinct end), I turned left and into a room with the door ajar and woke up. It sounds like a dream a lot of people have, so I didn't think anything else about it.

In my late 20s, I attended a certain schoolhouse at the then-named Ft. Benning, **** was walking down a barracks hallway to go talk to a classmate about some stuff we needed to pack for an upcoming field exercise. About halfway down the hall, it hit me. I almost went to my knees - heart rate increased; breathing was rapid. The walls were that specific cream color, the trim and doors were a dark wood color, flourescent light filled the hall, I was nervous and excited about my graded field exercise coming up, and the person I was going to talk to? Last door on the left. 

Everything was exact. Not similar; exact. I cant explain it. Sure, hallway dreams are pretty common, and I've experienced multiple different hallway dreams like everyone else. But this was an exact replica of my dream - so exact that the remembering felt like a jolt to my nervous system.

I've gotten used to them over the years, and they now only happen maybe two or three times per year. I recover quickly - most of the time, no one notices when it now happens.

I've never discussed this with my family. Now, my young son started having these rare spells where he gets dizzy and I ask if he's OK. This last time, he said, ""I'm OK, I've just ... been here before ... in a dream.""

517,Dreams,Trouble .,"I almost have some sort of dream instantly on sleeping. If I think about a certain situation/a person/ an event just as I'm about to , it'll be 100% tied in the dream.


But I've been always having extremely vivid dreams(not always lucid) , those that I'd have to actively forget unless it'll stick with me for a long time because almost 90% of those are bad(really dire). It's not like a paralysis , because I am actively moving with the story and I'm contributing to it.


The thing that adds to this is , I always wake up within 2-5 hours since I've started sleeping, even if I'm dead tired. And I can't go back to sleep again, I just have an entirely bad day with some catchup (&lt;1h) during the day. This even happened yesterday(~2h).


I never tried to lucid dream except for that a few times dome yrs ago. 

I just want to have good sleep. Is it too much to ask?",2024-05-08 11:32:28

Every time when I step into a car in my dream, I always shift gears very clumsily and I drive way too fast. I swerve a lot of times and I hit almost everything in my path.

519,Dreams,Dream of white snake bite that was gifted to me,"My dream's a little bit crazy. My brother-in-law loved snakes in my dream (in real life this makes no sense) and he gifted me a white snake. In my dream world, having a snake inside your mouth was a trend for some reason and he encouraged me to put the snake in my mouth. I did it and some hours later I started to panick realizing how dangerous it was and I took if off my mouth and let it in my room. The snake was not moving and looked dead. I though about calling police/firefighters to get rid of the snake but after I entered my room again the snake was alive and under my bed. It got irritated with me and ended up biting me on my left arm and my dream ended.

I have no idea what it means or if it's just a relly odd dream. My mom told be it could be betrayal or something. I just started a new job and now I am worried.",2024-05-08 11:30:42

521,Dreams,has anyone has dreams of people they eventually met in real life? ,"i have had 3 dreams that felt so real to me that i still haven't forgotten years later because it feels more like a memory than a dream. 

dream 1 (around 7-8 years ago): i was on a back porch. someone with long curly black hair comes out and they felt like my person immediately. i knew it wasnt just a friend. they came out with a toddler, a little girl with long black hair. 

dream 2 (around 4 years ago): i was in bed laying on my back. i was playing with a little boy with blonde hair. i kept bouncing him up and down, he was so happy even though i could never see anyones faces. 

dream 3: (most recent about a year ago): i felt older but happy. i go into a vets office and talk to one of the nurses. shes calling me mom and i just remember feeling so proud. 

my fiancee has long curly black hair and has the exact same body type as i remember in my dream, years before meeting her. i have no kids and we plan to adopt, so im probably not gonna know how accurate my dreams are with the children until that happens. does anyone have a similar dream experience and met people irl from dreams? am i having dreams of my kids in a past life? 

(wont lie, i hope they are true. i genuinely felt sad anytime i woke up out of these dreams. it also sticks out to me that they felt so real to the point i can feel and see the dream in my mind still.) ",2024-05-08 10:44:43
522,Dreams,I had a long Invasion of the Body Snatchers type dream,"Last night I dreamt I was working in som en kind of sci-fi science lab and there was an emergency. We all had to evacuate through escape pods. The escape pods can hold 2 people so me and a guy from my irl work got in and the pod shoots out right into a sand dune as apparently the whole facility was located on a beach. So as most people show up from the escape pods we all start to realise that there is no one from outside the facility. No one has any signal on their phones either. We're there on the beach unable to communicate to the outside. So we start to investigate the beach.

The beach itself has a pier and some buildings, also a multi level parking building. 

After a while someone manages to call a family member and they're being told the power is out in their areas well which means there's a large power outage happening. People just kinda make the best of the situation and settle down in the surrounding buildings, my gf also shows up and we go for a walk in a small farm section. Other people are there and they're very fascinated by a slug. A guy from my irl work has the slug on his hand with some decorative fake snail houses and the slug quickly slithers into one but goes back out as it's not a usable snail house. People hold it turn by turn and when I have it I just put it on the ground over a fence and a chicken quickly rushes to it and pecks it and runs away again.

""The slug is fine"" I lie to the others but a small girl goes ""the chicken ate it yea?"" So reply with ""yea SSH"" and walk away.

After a while we're in a more industrial area with the parking building nearby and we all start noticing a blue bird, a Bluejay I think. It's flying erratic and hits a wall and falls down however when I go to it it's completely fine, its beak is a but crumpled at the end but besides that its fine. Then a bear shows up and attacks me however no matter what the bear does I remain fine and I manage to escape its grasp. My brother shows up with his 6 year old daughter and the bear just drags her away and when we try to help her she's fine as well.

At this point people just kinda panic and find some cars in the parking lot and try to drive away but it becomes such s cluttered mess they all start jamming eachother so there's no way out.

We find a device that checks the amount of life forms touching the sensor so we try it out by touching it. The skin of a human is full of bacteria and living things so whoever touches it the device should give a number in the thousands but no matter who tries it out it gives something in the twenties.

We all feel pretty good as well, in fact my 98 year old grandma shows up who's been a bit under the weather recently but when she shows up she has a healthy appetite and is in a general good condition. Also whenever we try the life forms device the number drops to the point that it says 1, if you touch it it's just you touching it.

We then find a laptop with satellite images and we go back to the moment that bird showed up and when we zoom in we clearly see a UFO in the clouds. Aliens are behind it all!

So we just start living our lives there, there's a nice patio where we all can have drink and sit around with some music. We all have the idea that we're all the same now, there's a difference in our looks but as we are all a single lifeform instead of a collection of germs and bacteria there's not really s big difference between us anymore.

Then later I decide to try out the lifeform device again and it's back on 26. Whatever was going on it's going away again.

I then woke up.",2024-05-08 10:32:20

But the way this person is to me in my dream literally makes my heart swell. What does this mean?? Is this like a soulmate ? Future partner I haven’t come in contact yet with?

527,Dreams,Dream When My Dad Passed,"Possible trigger warning, as I will be talking about blood.

Background story to possibly help with my question.

My dad had, at the time, recently had stints put in due to his heart condition, and my dad had never been very healthy and as sad as it is, we always were expecting the worst as he would never really get better, but this time, he was getting better, and was recovering well, but before then, I constantly would think about, “What if he passes away?”. My dad ended up being released from the hospital and was doing good for a couple days, so I had lost all worry of him being ill. He started having chest pain, but he wanted to sleep it off and see the doctor the next morning, but ended up having a heart attack in his bathroom at some point overnight. I was visiting my mom at the time.

While I was visiting my mom for the summer, I had a dream about blood dripping, and that was really it to the dream, there was nothing else and just blood dripping, and I woke up from it, maybe 4AM-ish? The dream caught me off guard, so I just got a water and then went back to bed. I carried on with my day when I did get up, and didn’t think anything of the dream, but found out later that day my dad had passed away that night, and the dream has since then haunted me. Did I somehow know deep down it was happening? Did he pass away when I had the dream?",2024-05-08 10:14:28
528,Dreams,Why did I viscously murder a woman in a dream,"In my dream I was playing Rainbow Six Siege. I know, kinda silly but it’s what I was doing. No crazy gore or anything just playing as a character in game. I killed a Kaid and then as I squatted in a doorway a girl that I had slept with and grown attached to in college appeared before me. For some reason I possessed some weird looking knife in my right hand so I began to attack her. I stabbed her in the thigh, then the stomach, then the shin. She was wearing white pants so the blood was very visible to me. It rushed from her wounds and began to pool on the floor. She taunted me and asked me if I missed her, all with a snide look on her face. I began crying saying that yes, I did miss her. She only began to laugh as I started crying and began sneering as I thought of the moments we shared together before she suddenly ghosted me. All of a sudden I stopped crying and grabbed a knife. I slashed it directly down on her head like I was slicing a cake. I could see the brain and blood in all its detail and I relished in her pain. She was shocked at first, but then went back to insulting me. With a twisted sense of enjoyment and pleasure I then turned the tip down and stabbed it directly in the center of her brain. In my dream I thought coldly and calculated how this might cause her brain function to alter or her mood to change. I thought about how much damage a brain could take before a person passed away. Somehow this act didn’t **** her though. We simply got up and went back to my home. Oh how I wanted her to die to stop laughing at me and to feel pain. We then sat down in my living room and I suddenly began to feel immense remorse and fear at what I had done. She sat down next to my mom of all people and leaned her head against her shoulder. Somehow I knew she would pass away but when I did not know. I began panicking because my I knew my mom would see her viscous wounds and wonder why she died. The coroner and police would discover quite quickly it wasn’t a natural death. My world began closing in on me upon the realization that I had forfeited my life and would spend the rest of my life in prison. Now all I could wonder was I feeling remorse for my actions or just that I got caught. Also why the **** did I **** someone in my dream!?",2024-05-08 10:12:51
529,Dreams,"Helped my future self? Saw yellow ball of scribbles with yellow eyes, woke me up","I forgot most of the dream but recall the essence being where I was helping someone who turned out to be myself who I think lived in my unconscious.. time didn’t seem to apply

When I gave him something he showed me his face which looked like me

Then opened this old giant looking book 

All the pages were cut out in a perfect square 

What we saw was this sad looking ball of scribbles with yellow eyes

Than the other me said

Finally, this is the thing causing all our problems, now we know what it looks like

As I’m looking at it
It woke me up 

Way before my alarm and the wake up was diff than usual it was like I legit phased into waking day by day without even blinking but closer to being transported while my eyes were open entire time

No blinking or missing memories 
Almost like wasn’t suppose to look at it

Family believes in curses / black magic, my dad not so much but he’s got weird sticks all over the house and he’s not a good person (abusive growing up and is a horder making house a mess, stole lots of money from mom all thru the years yet still together due to final limitations) 

I tend to ignore negative stuff as I realized the best way to beat that stuff is literally not give it any power by thoughts / belief / actions etc and just melts away 

Curious if anyone has any inputs on this type of situation

The dream prior to me seeing it was me was rather adventurous kinda like a indie jones movie, kinda stressful but deff fun 
Maybe was just a playful adventure w a made up entity haha ",2024-05-08 09:56:43
530,Dreams,I had a dream where I was Fascist Voldemort,"It seemed like I was telling a story at first but became more real, I was going into this boarding school in a country like France (though it was an alternate reality I think because I saw two moons in the sky, however upon further consideration it could be in the future where the Moon split or the Earth gained another satellite, perhaps a rogue asteroid or something) but then it turned making out with a girl only to find out she was an **** guy and how communist the school was. I accused the and then I activated my magic powers (it might have been a magic school like Hogwarts or some ****) and attacked everyone in the great hall while floating, even going as far to activate black magic and risk my soul. It was like **** Harry Potter and I was Voldemort. So I turned on them and joined a fascist government and exposed them, I lead them to the location while hiding until some female students saw me who I mocked and stole one of their phones, then we marched on the school and burned the place down, send people to camps. I also believe I would get to have some female students as slaves. We could tell which students to round up because the communist ones would fly certain flags, while the others wouldn't. There was this woman in charge of the operation I remember and she was asking me about these bullets that blind people, last thing I remember I was getting a gun. Maybe it was a glimpse of the future, or another timeline.",2024-05-08 09:49:09

I dream very vividly, always have, and I usually remember at least 1 dream a night, every night. I wake up a lot throughout the night and can just pick up in a dream where I left off. No matter what is actually going on in my dreams, there is always some type of post apocalyptic vibe to it. It can be the typical like Walking Dead/I Am Legend type setting, or something more subtle. Last night I had a dream about an old job I had, hiring people to set up a store, but all the windows and doors were shattered and broken out throughout the entire mall. The sky was dark and cloudy, even though it was made apparent that it was midday in the dream. We worked completely in the dark throughout the dream, leaves and dirt blew through the store and everyone acted as if it were completely normal. It was a lot more detailed but that’s the basic idea around what was happening.

533,Dreams,dream where i owe a dollar general hundreds of dollars,"i have been having these reoccurring dreams where i am walking around a dollar general and then realize i can't buy anything because half of the checkouts i already bought items with but didn't have the money to pay for the items, so i just tried to leave the store without getting the checkout clerks attention. also sometimes the store looked like a walmart 😭

anyway last night i had the dream again, but this time i came in with a friend. the person did not look like anyone i knew irl (when awake) but we were acting like best friends lol. the friend was there with me giving me support to pay for the items i havent been able to pay for for months. i remember one of the cashiers i went to was talking about how someone had bought items but never paid months ago and showed me the bag he had kept at his station of the items and i just casually responded, 'yeah that's me 😭' and said i was finally gonna pay for them. i went to every checkout i had items held at to pay for them, most costed around $5-$25 but the last one i had to pay for had a bill of over $100. i couldn't afford that one so i got nervous and dragged my friend out of the store while avoiding that checkout at all costs. lol but the friend and i came to a conclusion that at least i paid most of them and we walked back to the car that was suddenly in a walmart parking lot from my hometown–

We ended up at the local social district of town and the ""hip"" (idk how to desribe it lol) local bar/pub and we go for a walk.

We come across what appears to be skid row and there are homeless people all around the stairs we walk up then some people with n33dles behind a half closed door - before walking into this massive corridor in which people were ion cages (these people were all poor or addicts)

It was ran by a VERY powerful being called ""Paris"" I think was here name and my friend turns to me and says ""im going in"" I get a cricket bat out and start trying to stop him while keeping these zombies away trying to turn back - its not use.

And so I finish paying and I’m trying to find the kid and I walk into a house next door and I’m like hello I’m not sure if you just saw a little boy walk by but he was looking for apple juice and I told him to wait for me and I would buy it for him but idk where he might have gone. And the lady who lived there was like oh come here and I follow her and in a book shelf she points to a pic of him and she’s like he died a few years ago but he always remembered that you wanted to get him apple juice. And in the pic of him he was older, as if like years went by from the time I paid to when I went back to get him??? It made me super sad because all he wanted was apple juice and I couldn’t find him so we could go get it for him.

547,Dreams,Demon Dream,"I started out in some kind of school focused on the study of three particular demons. I was given a book that contained their images but no real significant information like names, purpose or abilities. The first demon was small in stature, thin sharp claws, a tail and no definitive **** features but as black as a shadow. The second was heavier set, had large claws for cleaving people in half but appeared to be gentle in nature or at least uninterested in doing anything other than sleeping. The third demon was tall lanky and looked more refined and was definitely the brains of the three. All the demons had the same shadow like color.(we’ll refer to them as shadow demons for now) 

Oddly enough there were three portals for the study of each shadow demon which I and the rest of the school were tasked with. Though I came up with the great idea of collecting more information from these demons by having a one on one experience rather than looking through the enormous library that I was aware existed but had no clue where it actually was. I decided I’ll step into the portal that led to the heavier set demon and simply observe and then leave. Upon stepping through the portal I found the demon dressed in a checkered shirt and beige khaki pants, seemingly exhausted from a long day of work lying peacefully on its bed. Its skin was still dark as a shadow but it had light blue  eyes that resembled a fly and ears like a black rabbit sharp and pointed. Once I had seen enough of this shadow demon I went back through the portal to give my report on my finding.

Once through the portal, my sister ran over to me to discuss how she had discovered some new information on the three demons from the library and was heading back there now to find out more. I couldn’t remember the details of what she said because I was more focused on relaying my information to the higher ups which happened to be the leading professional on demonology. However, I did notice that as she was leaving for a brief second she looked like the first shadow demon on all fours running back to the library. I thought nothing of it simply thought my mind was playing tricks on me since I just came through a portal.

Once I reached the leading professional of demonology I began to tell him of my findings but his demeanor suggested that what I was saying was not for everyone to hear. He quickly told me we should talk about this in some place more private and began to form a portal that would lead us into a pocket dimension away from prying eyes.( the three portals that lead to the shadow demons were green in color and were concave in shape. The portal this man had created was kite shaped but had the same green color which struck me as odd). The moment he created the portal his human form began to fade and for brief second he looked like the third shadow demon, tall lanky, sharp and longer claws than before as he beckoned me to follow him into the portal, upon seeing this I was hesitant but something in my gut told me not following him would be a death sentence as something or someone was coming quickly.

Fearing for my life I followed him in and the moment I did his form changed into my cousin and I was immediately put at ease. The portals that led to the other demons closed and the entity that came through the door to the library was my mother shouting and looking for me. The dimension I was in was like a glass box. I could see her but she couldn’t see me, we were right next to each other but couldn’t interact. She soon gave up and went back into the door I assumed led into the library. The shadow demon now shaped as my cousin suggested we head back as the danger had passed and believed my mother needed me for something. As we head back through the portal we end up not at the school but  in another pocket dimension that resembles the back rooms but rather than a yellow room with lights. It is a silver room with a slippery floor, two windows that lead outside and a large mirror on one portion of the wall. The shadow demons true form is revealed here and he is unable to decieve me any longer, he looks in the mirror and is immediately frightened and begins to run and look for an exit, sliding frantically across the floor. I am curious so I go over to look at the mirror only to find a figure dressed in dark yellow robes hands together like Darth sidious and a hood over its head with pitch black darkness where a head should be standing right behind me. It was about 8ft tall and began to walk away from to my right I ran in the opposite direction and looked around to see where it was only to see nothing.

Soon I began to hear footsteps running towards me and the shadow demon. In that moment I realized I could only see this entity in a mirror and began to push myself across the room as the floor was too slippery to run. In order to gain more momentum I took off one shoe and used my foot as a paddle while my other foot was a boat that I could slide on as I maneuvered away from the entity with each footstep getting louder. The shadow demon eventually got away by coming back the way we came I on the other hand made my way toward the window as fast as I could and jumped through it all the way down to
My demise( the building I had jumped out of was as tall as a skyscraper. I then awoke confused and glad to be alive.",2024-05-08 05:56:28

549,Dreams,Is reading in dreams normal? ,"Basically the title, I just woke up from a pretty awesome dream/dreams. I was at my grandparents playing on my cousins Xbox 360, except the game was like a card game that looked really cool. I “killed” a glowing boss dude out in the middle of a foggy forest and when I went to “loot him”, he a had about 40 different cards, usually coming from a “meta” deck ranked anywhere from half a star to 5 stars. Me playing the game was interrupted by something happening in the other room, I don’t know what though as I I was quickly coming back to the Xbox to see what game it was, I open the disc tray to look at the game and see there’s two games. One’s a normal disc that says Dying Light 2(never played this before), and then changes to some new fallout game. But under this disc is another disc, it’s smaller, about half the diameter of a regular disc. I look at it, and I’m my mind, “this is the game I was playing”. It clearly says “The Foundry II” ok the disc, I load it up and a settings page pops open. I’m reading the settings and there’s a clickable box that says “troll mode”, which I find funny. Idk, my dreams are **** weird, but when I woke up I remembered reading that you “can’t read in dreams” and I just thought to myself that’s **** since I read stuff all the time.",2024-05-08 05:51:08
550,Dreams,weird little dream i just woke up from,"11:00 ; GMT+2 ; 8^(th) May, 2024

Allow me to set the stage: The day dragged on, &amp; then it was my grandma, sis and me in the night in my house or some ****. It was nighttime and the living room was dark as ****, except for a few yellow lights and my laptop.

At some point, my grandma’s eyes were just weirdly wide open with a tiny grin while talking to me (she was sitting on the table at the laptop where I would normally sit). Then I went to have a shower, and after I got out- instead of my hallway, I exited into my dark **** room, with a single light source leading me back to the room after I walked into the darkness of it.

Then when I made my way to my laptop again, there was this creepy little baby the size of a 12 year old to my right when I sat down (I didn’t notice that, it was a subtle nightmare that didn’t feel like one). Then I had a brilliant idea to test out (possible context?: I prayed the night before in 4:30 am). In the url bar, I typed out “yhwh” (with a struggle &amp; numerous spelling errors ofc), but I did it.

The whole time, the creepy **** baby which looked like a combination of a normal baby and hasbullah started laughing, louder and louder (not having read what I typed out, but just laughing like some baby, like I wasn’t gonna sus it out). I pushed the now floating laptop to it, and when it read the “yhwh”, it started **** screaming and wailing (not like a demon mind you, still sounded like a baby, but STILL it screamed at the sight of “yhwh”). Then my alarm woke me up before **** got even creepier.",2024-05-08 05:22:09

552,Dreams,Brutal murder dream ,"
Had a really horrible dream of me killing a vulnerable, either young/ disabled girl (can’t remember which one.  The Only “vivid” part of the dream was the act of killing her, which without putting too much detail, was SO brutal….Like so violent and gory and just f**ked! Body mutilation type gory.

I remember hiding her and trying to cover it up…. I can’t remember too much but I think me (f) and my ‘in real life’ partner (f) were dating in the dream but it was a case that if our boss found out we’d have to split up, lose jobs ext ext… and the victim was gonna tell the boss/ caught us, something like that.

But anyway…. It’s was such a sick dream, I remember a morbid part where the boss came n spoke to us (cuz it was in dream land n we were at his place for some reason lol)….and I was basically hiding the c*rose of the dwarf/ young girl in a scarf n holding it in my arms

But yeah, just wanted to share it cuz I’ve no clue what it means; it was messed up n I woke up in sweats n relieved I didn’t actually brutally **** someone!!! ",2024-05-08 04:35:46
553,Dreams,Crazy Dream,"Context, I’ve been trying to stop smoking za, and when I stop my dreams are insane

The entire world was in a square, the vase majority of it was just ocean, only on the close corners of the square had land, there was a sky but there is nothing outside of the square, it was very futuristic and the scenery of the ocean along with the rocky land was beautiful, I was riding a sick bike, like a neon bike, I was going really fast around the corner in the square when suddenly there was a zombie apocalypse, imagine the most horrific zombie apocalypse where buildings are burning, cars are flipped over, everything’s on fire, and zombies were everywhere eating people, then ^2 that by scarier, I climbed up a pole to get out of reach of the zombies, there were 3 TWD zombies trying to eat me, then my older cat suddenly appeared on the ground, but lucky the zombies were distracted by me, so she was save for the time being, but then I got bite 🤖, since I was bitten already and going to die, I decided to **** the 3 zombies so my cat will be save after I die, I jumped down the pole while repeatedly stabbing the brains of the zombies, but they would not die, even after I completely destroyed their brains they kept coming, then it turned out one of the zombies was a variant, it started speaking to me (I don’t remember what it said but it was scary, very very scary) then I woke up in a puddle of my sweat, completely terrified, my body was very hot, I was melting, but cold at the same time, I had to dry my skin off with tissues, then I went back to sleep ofc 🥲, when I got back to the square, it was the same as before the zombie apocalypse, beautiful and technically advanced, even more so than before, the people had started building entire landmasses over the ocean and even made bridges across the ocean, then an alien creature came down, I think it was definitely a self-automated AI biological robot tasked to eliminate humanity, it was a killing machine, with the most advanced weapon systems, it had giant saws in its body attached to highly mobile arms, rocket missiles, laser beams, and even more technologically advanced things even the smartest human could never comprehend, it was just **** everyone around, no one could escape it, sawing up people close to him and blowing up people out of melee range with massive missiles nukes, I and everyone around were running for our lives, trying to escape, I turned the corner of a building then I reached a wall of the square, but there was a strange door that glowed black, I ran through the door trying to escape the bio-robot, which i successfully did, when I went through the door I was back at my childhood home, outside of the square, it was now as though the square was in a 2d world, but I was out in the 3d world, there were still people being killed but I was save for the time being, I was then on the balcony of my childhood home, then I looked in the sky to see a giant alien spacecraft, probably bigger than earth, it was hundreds of thousands of miles away yet still massive in the sky, it started glowing red on its bottom center, almost as if it was charging up some kind of world destroying laser beam, to which I promptly woke up again in a puddle of my sweat absolutely terrified.",2024-05-08 04:15:30
554,Dreams,To The Dream Analyzers of Reddit: I need you to analyze my dream for me.,"Ok so I had this dream recently and it had a lot of elements to it and I would really like it analyzed. The dream played out like a movie, like I wasn't seeing it through my eyes, but like I was watching it. It started out with me and this girl walking through an abandoned cemetery. It definitely wasn't a real place but it felt so familiar. Me and this girl are talking and I told her,""I really like cemeteries."" And she said,""I don't, I've learned not to do that."" And for some reason that made me fall in love with her. While walking through the cemetery, we found an abandoned house, so we went inside. Inside contained records of all the graves in this really old book. There were about 5 pictures in the book of certain gravestones. Every time I looked at one of the pictures I would see the gravestone in the ""present"" and see how worn down then were, then I would see the picture of before it was worn down. After I put the book down me and the girl saw a casket made of glass in the middle of this room. It was really dirty and dusty, so if there was a body in it we couldn't see it. I leaned over it to peer in and I heard the girl gasp. So I turned around, and some guy was dragging in a body. We just stared at him and he stared back for a minute. Next thing I know, we are outside the house and he slams the door on us. That man had nothing to do with the rest of the dream, he never even gets mentioned again. Me and the girl then just left. We planned out a date to go to the beach together. So, about a day later me and her went on a date at the beach at night. We were walking on the beach while she held on to me. We walked under this pier where she then kissed me. I've kissed girls in my dreams before, but this time it felt so real. The kiss felt real, the happiness I got from it felt real. It was just so real feeling. The next day she's supposed to pick me up and take me to school. I woke up before she could, but like I said, it felt so real that I thought it actually happened. I opened my phone to text her, but to my dismay, she wasn't real. Please someone analyze all the strange components of my dream and get back to m. Thank You.",2024-05-08 04:14:03

556,Dreams,Car Accident Dream,"I (26f) have been having very vivid dreams lately. Last night/early morning I had a dream where I drove my car off a cliff on accident. Basically in my dream, my fiancé was upset at me for ruining his guitar case (which never happened and he doesn’t even have a guitar case). I was parked in my car, typing out a long apology in hopes of reconciling with him. I decided I needed to drive somewhere else to finish writing. I ended up on this winding cliffside, I took a corner too fast and my car flipped and flew off the side of the cliff. I was upside down in free fall and all I could think about was how I never got to send my message. In my dream I closed my eyes and my last thought was “I hope I don’t die” then I must’ve hit bottom because everything went blank and my eyes flew open. It felt like I died in my dream and woke up. It made me ponder on quantum immorality.

I do have cancer currently, I’m headed for a bone marrow transplant soon and I know the odds are a little better than a coin flip. I know that could very well be what has been influencing my dreams. The other night I had a dream where I was with my dad who is passed on. I got to take care of him and cover him with a blanket while he slept. I’m not sure what I’m hoping to get out of this post. Maybe just a shout into the void lol but it would be interesting to hear other people’s takes or opinions.

We went everywhere toghether and were so in love. The dream seemed to go on forever, it felt like 2 years went by of my life but those years were perfect. Finally with my dream girl and finally happy with my life.

558,Dreams,Help me with my dream analysis ,"So first of all some context : before going to sleep I was very scared and kept looking in my room for any ""figures"". Ok I fall asleep and in my first dream I dream my cats my dead cat actually. It's weird as I never  dreamed him not even once when he was alive. He was a beautiful black kitty, and I was in a dark room and I kept looking for red glowing eyes but only spotted my cat's eyes and calmed down (happens pretty often with black cats actually lol) and then brought a box of coacroaches to him and he didn't do anything just played with them.... typical. The only other time I dreamt my cat he was standing at the door the night when he died. And last night was the second night I dreamed about him. I don't wanna be weird but I like to think that he visits me in my dreams now that he can. It's weird that in so many years I didn't have a dream about him not even once. 

Dream 2 : I'm standing at a table with my family and we're eating. We're in the middle of the town..... like in the middle of a road and we're eating. I have no idea what we're eating ( I recently spent orthodox easter with my family in my home country so this doesn't sound weird just my brain replicating) but here comes the weird part ; a brown dog with red glowing eyes speaking scary latin gibberish comes in the frame and my grandma says :""yeah I know this dog"" as it passes by I say ""that is not a dog"" I see that it goes out of the frame and I calm down. Then I look behind and I see the dog staring at me with its mouth closed. I get scared and force my eyes open and I wake up. (I always force my eyes open in dreams when I get scared and it works, I don't always know I'm dreaming but if I get scared my brain knows it's a dream and sends signals so that I can force myself to wake up) I don't know out of all things why a dog tho. I love dogs, I have a dog.... one thing could be that in my home country dogs are demonized and treated horribly, and when I said that thing is not a dog I meant "" it's something evil taking the form of something innocent"". That's the explaination I gave myself. 

Third dream : (fun fact about me is that I'm able to read and write in dreams see time all that stuff) idk how and why. I dreamt that I went on reddit and wrote about the dog I saw in a previous dream. A person rsponded with "" op saud they're an atheist (true) so those are demons haunting them"" I responded with "" or just my brain producing the figure I was looking for all night long awake and my dreams with a bit of internet media ingrained in my brain :). Also I don't need a religion to justify my good actions and my strong moral compass. I'm a good human being without wanting the reward of a heaven, I do good because I want a better world for myself and others. I'm agnostic btw so I respect your beliefs..... or whatever makes you sleep at night"" ok dream me went hard but I understand why. During orthodox easter I bottled up a lot of things I wrote in my dream comment and brought up a lot of religious trauma. So I guess this was my way of taking it off my chest via dream. 

Fourth dream : There's more details but not really important ; the thing is my mum filmed for me a flower that blooms once a year at the top of a Mountain and I'm grateful. I don't have the best relationship with my mum but she's really trying lately and I push her away. This is my desire of trying too. 


I always remember my dreams almost every night",2024-05-08 03:08:14
559,Dreams,Friendly hat man,"My first post: 

I experience what is now known as the “hat ma” I first experienced it after my fathers passing after a couple years. I’ll given context further down,  it I was initially scared of the figure, but then. It and he seemed welcoming.


My context is I was on an America. Style ranch. Me and this surviving group (I assume zombie, but never confirmed) took refuge in an amefoz style ranch. We were trying to fix up a locomotive engine, to hopefully out run this plague. Me, who appeared as a young child of 10-12 saw a fully black figure wearing a wide brim cow-boy like hat. He was standing in the distance, on top of a sloping hill, waving slowly at me. Everyone within the group were scared of him, did their best to keep the distance from him. I, in my dreams met up with him and while still remaining fully black, he was nice, welcoming and an unopposing. He actually helped us get passed a manned train station port.

This dream only happens once. I have the ability to control my dreams 90% of the time,  but this wasn’t those times. I was aware that I was dreaming, but I realise that it was very real; I felt like if he caught up to me, I’d die. 

I cannot recall how old I was exactly but it was a few years after my father passed away from his second cancer. 

I had never heard of the hat man concept before this dream, but after reading about stories, visions and dreams; I had never comes across a friendly hat man before. He was scary initially, but all he did was wave as me slowly. he approached me abs he was nice, helpful and calming within my dream. 

After this, if death is an entity… I no longer fear it and I think they are welcoming of those who loves are ending.",2024-05-08 03:08:10
560,Dreams,alien invasion dream,"so I had a dream about an alien invasion happening. 3  meters landed   in each continent. inside these meters there were  small flying  robots similar to the things in destiny.  they were destroying cities and killing people in mass. and everyone  of course hated them but we stood no chance with thier advance  tech. 

there was one friendly robot I made friends with and  actively  protected  me.  electricity still worked tho so the people  I was living with was  just watching TV and stuff but we  were  being fairly quiet  bc we didn't want to grab attention of the robots. after a few weeks we  noticed  9  moon like objects in the sky and  alien ships flying in and out of hyper space.

2 days later  round  black  gooey aliens descended from the sky and they had white  teeth Inside of them. and they started   consuming all remaining humans. but luckly white  jelly fish creatures  descended  and started attaching then selves on to the humans, and the robots  went back up into the ships. I managed to grab holded of one the jelly fishes, which was fairly hard bc I had to fit my  whole body inside and somtimes I would slip and fall. 

I was taken up to space with the jelly fishes  and the 9 moon like objects weren't  moons but space  colonies! and everyone was  just happy, playing music and partying. the jelly fishes helped us breath  in space. we  realized the aliens were killing us  to make room  for the remaining survivors to comfortably live in space and  flee from the  true invaders. the  black gooey aliens  destoryed the   good aliens home and  didn't want the same to happen to earth. with limited materials they made a hard decision  to **** off 70% of the earth population  just so that they all wouldn't suffer the same fate  as them. aka, good ending for  humanity bad ending for earth bc now  earth literally  can't be saved

the jelly fishes act as  anti bodies and the gooey aliens can't attack them.

there are  other details but  thier hard to put into text since  it's soo minor  yet some what a key part of the dream that made it a dream, but thier more like slice of life aspects like me trying to  create a fire, or  running away from  a alien robot that almost spotted me.  or how my   phone battery was  at 51% but had no way to charge it. or  how  we had to find new land  cause we were in an ocean house but it was really risky with the robots around.

there was also this time were I woke up briefly  and  lost everything I was carrying snd the people were like ""oh that's what happens when you wake up in  a dream"" XD ",2024-05-08 02:01:38

For example, there’s this intense feeling of atmosphere. it’s like a combination of being in a place that’s thrilling, comforting, and nostalgic. Like maybe a feeling of exploration but also safety, but also a feeling like it won’t last? idk.

Another one is an intense sense of companionship in the midst of being lost. Like the fear of being lost, but the comfort of being lost together. Does anyone have feelings like this?

563,Dreams,what does my dream mean?,"so last night I had a dream where I was like rock climbing or smth on a huge mountian, and when I was jumping from rock to rock, my crush (who im pretty **** sure is playing mind games on me rn), came out of no where, and I slipped, and fell off the cliff and died. When I ""awoke"", I was a ""ghost"", and only dead people could see me (although later on it my dream alive people could see me again, but only a few of them). After that there was some parts I couldnt remember and the next thing I did i was driving a truck or a car or smth and it was through a forest, but it was like in gta or some racing game where you fly through a forest at like 100 kmh and slam into a tree (which I did), and there was some more parts I dont remeber, but I do remember being very sad, and feeling weird, like something was happening, like that feeling you get a few days before you move away from your hometown as a kid, into something unknown, and that feeling was very strong. also I remember about 2 or 3 times I woke up and realized i was dreaming, and felt very thankful that it was a dream, and then promptly falling back asleep and into this. Also I remember talking to another ghost (I think it was my dad, even though irl he is perfectly fine), and he was saying how he has to take this stuff to keep his body from going all bad, because hes going to re-wake up alive, and that his body was in a lab, and I asked him if I could take some, and he reminded me that I fell off of a cliff and my body was a pulp, and that it wouldnt do anything for me. also in real life im going through a big change (moving basically to the other side of the world), so if that has anything to so with it.

566,Dreams,My mom and I had the same dream,"My mom and I both dreamt last night that we were walking through my grandparents’ house. Both her parents have been dead for 20 and 15 years. The house we dreamt of we hadn’t seen in 23 years. 

Her version of the house was a memorial to her parents and their family memories but things were slightly changed. She could smell the house though. And she was also looking in every room. 

My dream was more of a lucid dream. I was looking through each room to see if it matched how it looked as I was a child, but I was aware that I was dreaming and the house was different. And each time I opened a door the room would be different than the last time. 

I wasn’t in my mom’s dream. But she was in mine as were my family members. My late aunt was showing me how she had redecorated her old room and made it more colorful. 

My mom and I have always had vivid dreams. But we’ve never had dreams about the same place at the same time. We dream about houses that she had I have lived in but never the same night. 

I told my friends and they all think it’s very weird and there must be something to it because this house and the walking through the house was so specific to my mom and I. 

Any thought?

567,Dreams,dreams are just a sandbox?,"dreams are just a sandbox?

why dreams feel to be just a reinforcement of things we already agree, believe, think, like etc..

Could it be because it is just that?

in fiction (right?) dreamers pose like telepaths, future tellers, or other powers, but all that could just be coincidence, or even the logical result of observation and knowledge of how things may most probably happen.

to me, dreams feel like something that is trying to keep our mind busy to prevent we moving and waking up. Or, if it is a bad dream, it means that my body is suffering of cold or gases etc, and I need to wakeup and fix that to be able to go back to sleep confortably.

Timeskip to me going for a break and wandering around. Layout was similar to junior high school(but materials halls were made from looked the same),i turned right from classroom door and started walking,i looked to the right once i was at the end of corridor and saw light,walked into it and got into stalls to do my deed,walked out and returned to different classroom and that is when i noticed. 

Doors dont work like in real life,the space where this different classroom was overlapped with the classroom i was in earlier. It's hard to explain but imagine that there is new door in your house,from left side wall and right side wall you see there is barely any space to move and basically looks like corridor appeared,but when you come into this new door you see inside that the space is much bigger than what you could logically understand from outside.

After going into the classroom this time there were only 7 people inviting me in,i took a seat near one of them and everyone became much happier.

I am starting to think that those dreams are a message or allegory of some choice and that i was one of the rare people to find the good choice. Like the number of people choosing in classrooms were somehow similar(today's dream: 5 rows in front,3 in back + the row i was sitting in = 9 rows per column and 3 columns in total,totaling 54 people),but feels like they were dwindling and the very same people covered in thick layer of aura were driving underground in one of my other dreams.

However this is my first time seeing a light aura,literally like a good ol' lightbulb but white'ish and there were only 7 people in the classroom.

If this is something special in real life or soul realm then wow. Thanks to whoever chose me,out of 8 billion people.

If its not real life related then whatever,at least i can dream. lol

AND YES,this dream was forced,just like half of the other classroom dreams.

Forced dream can happen at any time in the day(even after waking up) and you get 100% chance to get any dream during that time and it works like this:you get extremely sleepy and an unhinged desire to just go to sleep,like something is controlling you.

570,Dreams,I’m scared ,"I had a dream that the man I love died, this happened 2 or 3 times, the first time I was crying because I was saying how much I wanted to be with him. The next time he died at the airport because someone didn’t protect him, I was heartbroken again but this time he came back to life, does that mean I will actually lose him (not death wise) but I also had a dream that he was my soulmate and he gave me flowers what does that mean?",2024-05-07 23:27:34
571,Dreams,"Dream about late sunrise, sun bouncing east to west continuously","I had a strange albeit beautiful dream 



I slept early because the sun set super early that day, I remember a vague sense of fear I woke up early for a jog, and noticed it was still dark outside, even though it was past 7 am which is the sunrise time in my country. I jogged on the road dodging any light traffic and remember telling myself again and again that soon there will be light and I will feel safer When I jogged towards a river and a bridge, I saw the first few streaks of light. I was excited but the sun did not look normal, it was a radial gradient of orange and yellow colours, kind of like the angel number backgrounds from pinterest. It started to make its way up into the sky and bounce all the way to the west, then it came all the way back. Kind of like a parabola.



 I was too stunned to speak and having never (legit never) seen a sunrise in my life before I thought this is how sunrises work I remember feeling shame and shock in my dream , felt embarassed to ask people around me because they might judge me for never seeing a sunrise the sun kept bouncing left and right in the sky a couple of times, i tried clicking pictures but my camera app hanged, i tried recording and the video came out blurry 



A couple of joggers near me started discussing how they want to get a good pic too and later said we will see you again tomorrow morning when jogging this route 



Fast forward Im discussing this with my mom (still in my dream) and she says she heard a lot of rumbling in the morning I tell her how I didn’t know what a normal sunrise comprises of and she lashed out at me for doubting my own knowledge (this is why I think the dream could be interpreted to reveal my lack of confidence towards what I know) 



What could the sun bouncing left and right continuously be signifying? Has this happened in any of your dreams before?",2024-05-07 23:18:06
572,Dreams,Dreams with the same character and same place that I haven’t met.,"This is really long winded and I apologize in advance. I have been having sleep paralysis and lucid dreams for a long time. Sometimes it’s a dazed sleep paralysis where I know I’m in my bed or on my couch but things are going on around me that aren’t real, but I have been noticing more and more that I am aware of being in my bed but being somewhere else. I have had repeated dreams where I am at a place called Jolene’s Diner and it’s just like a typical day. Go in, talk to the people I run into, help the servers sometimes.. I never actually eat, but it’s the same employees every time and I can read numbers and words and recognize faces of people I haven’t met, so it’s like I’m conscious. Last night I was dreaming that I was in a classroom (I am 31 years old, so it has been a while since I have been in class) and I was talking to a girl named Taylor. We were friends in the dream and I could see her face clearly. Nothing was odd about our conversation or anything going on around us. Just two friends hanging out in class. I caught myself making a reference to something funnier she did earlier that day and it was like my consciousness kicked in as I said it. I realized that this was at least the third time I remember being in a school and having dreams with her. I looked at her to ask if we were in each other’s dreams and if I was actually myself. When I looked up at her, I know she could tell I was about to say something and it’s like something pulled me out and back into my bed to prevent me from acknowledging that I was on a different plane or something? It felt like I got zapped in the forehead with a big “brain boom” and when I came back to an awake state, I legitimately felt like my legs were floating. I don’t know if anyone has experienced this before. I have heard of lucid dreaming and astral projection but I have not heard of someone going to the same place with the same strangers on a consistent or semi-consistent basis. Any thoughts?",2024-05-07 23:18:01

574,Dreams,Premonition dreams,"A few years ago I dreamt about my boyfriend (now ex) getting arrested and going to prison. It was distressing to me, but I wrote it off as a just a weird dream. As far as I knew, he hadn’t been doing anything to warrant the police showing up at my door looking for him. I also didn’t know why he was arrested in my dream. 

A couple weeks after he actually got arrested. I don’t want to share the details, but just know it was for something really awful. I immediately recalled the dream and it freaked me out. He’s now in prison. This event was very traumatic and it completely changed me as a person. I don’t know how I subconsciously knew something bad was coming. It’s been 3 years and I still think about it.

577,Dreams,My Dreams have created the strangest world.,"I talked on this Sub-Reddit before about when I thought my dream was showing me an alternate universe.

But now I want to mention a world I've been taken to in my dreams. And with a forever adapting story.

So be ready for this:

Me, my real life friends and family and my favourite fictional animal/non human characters live in a Bojack Horseman esque world. Where everyone has themed jobs to there fictional counterpart some examples being:

Blaze the Cat is the princess of a forgein country. Honey the Cat, Loopy De Loop (Jellystone version) and Velvette from Hazbin Hotel run seperate competing fashion shops. Princess Carolyn and Jewel the Beetle are agents for performers. And a bunch of other crazy stuff.

What's even wierder and jobs me, my friends and family have. Like I'm a singer whi performs in costume. My friend Nathan is an actor. One of my sisters who name is [REDACTED] is a nightclub bouncer amd my other sister [REDACTED] is a taxi driver.

So yeah pretty crazy world.",2024-05-07 21:18:15

580,Dreams,What does this mean?,"The last couple months I have been having the same thing happen in 80% of my dreams. The dream continues on however it wants but at some point my vision can’t focus on anything. Almost like the room is spinning from being too ****. I acknowledge in the dream that it happens all the time &amp; I get frustrated. The dream continues on how it wants to but all I get to see is the spinning/ annoying part of it. 
Also, another thing that’s been happening for a really long time is wherever I fall asleep that’s where the dream takes place. Say I fall asleep on the couch with my baby laying on my chest, the dream will start &amp; end exactly like that. All I have to do it open my eyes &amp; it’s the exact same just without all of the things that went on. Today during my nap I woke up bc my mom was at the end of my bed yelling at me in my dream, when I woke it’s the exact same just no mom. There’s more details but that’s the summary of what’s been happening inside my head as of late lol ",2024-05-07 20:56:05
581,Dreams,What do you think about my lucid fever dream? (Literally fever dream) ,"
Sharing my first dream here because I want to hear everyone’s thoughts. 
I’ve had sporadic lucid dreams now for at least 10 years. I never go to sleep trying to lucid dream, it just happens. Mostly when I’m napping during the day. 
I’m sick with a fever right now, so I just woke up from another nap and lucid dream.
I started out thinking I was awake and healthy. I was out in the city exploring, sat my phone or wallet or keys or something down in this empty carpeted room with white walls that was at the bottom of a big building, and kept walking around outside. 
Later I decided I was going to go take a shower and get some coleslaw from this place by my work (was thinking about that before I fell asleep lol), so I went back to the little room to get the stuff I had left. When I got there, it was full of strangers and I got the idea that a party had just started. They were still laying out party favors on card tables and everyone was greeting each other. I noticed that some of the party favors were these celtic ornaments I’d seen in an airport but didn’t buy, and I regretted it. 
A guy who gave me the vibe of a youth group leader greeted me, and he must have noticed I was surprised or confused because he asked if I was there for the party. I told him I was just grabbing some stuff I left. He acted like he really wanted me to stay, and I felt really comfortable, so I did.
The party also had the vibes of some organized young adult gathering. There were no drinks or drugs, just people talking, laughing, running around and the same song playing over and over. 
A few of the people were helping me look for my stuff, then I finally decided I hadn’t left anything behind after all. I wasn’t worried or anything. Then, I can’t remember why, I told the leader I needed to go to the kitchen or something. He opened a door and said “This is the fastest way to get there,” and a few others went in before me. 
He kind of pushed me but I didn’t feel scared. I started flying down a huge slide in a dark tunnel with red and green lights, bouncing up and down but nothing hurt. My phone flew out of my pocket and the same thing happened to the guy who was in front of me, and we caught each other’s phones. I wasn’t even worried about not having my own phone, just laughed.
I think this is the point I realized I was dreaming.
When we got out of the tunnel, everyone had come with us and we were outside in the dark. The same song was still playing, and everyone started dancing in circles or just walking around smiling. I was just watching everyone, enjoying being there. 
This was a big step for me, because I’ve never felt comfortable with the strangers in my lucid dreams. I’ve always yelled at them or tried to wake up. These people felt real and good and like they were glad I was there. 
Eventually, everyone was standing in a circle around me. I walked slowly around the circle, just looking at everyone, trying to figure out who these people were. They all just kept smiling at me. Most were my age, but a few people had younger children with them. 
I remember thinking I had to leave so I could wake up. I still needed to take a shower before the basketball game (in real life). I could have stayed in there for ages, but I had the feeling that I could always come back and everyone would still be there.
I let the song finish one more time before I left with tears in my eyes. The only lyrics I remember were “I’m going to live like I’m going to live for the rest of my life.” 
I went back through the building to leave. It was actually a tall apartment building. In the lobby, there was a closed coffee shop (because it was early morning/night) but I still smelled warm coffee. As I exited, I discovered the building was called HOME. Then, I woke up.
I woke up with a sad feeling, because I felt like those people were stuck there and had been excited to have a guest. 
Good job if you’ve read this far. I just had to get that out and hopefully hear some thoughts about it. Maybe someone has experienced something similar. ",2024-05-07 20:51:42
582,Dreams,grew an empty eye socket on my leg in a dream.,"this may sound really **** but i had this dream and i woke up so freaked out for some reason. in my dream, i noticed a line of what seemed to be impacted hair follicles on my right thigh. i went to tweeze them out, but then i realised they were actually eyelashes growing out of an eyelid which had appeared on my leg. the lid opened, and behind it was just an empty space where the eye should’ve (or definitely shouldn’t have???) been. it was bigger than a normal eye socket. i could put my finger inside it and stuff - it felt so realistic. i can still feel the sensation of touching it, and of the air touching the inside of the empty socket. the eye was oriented so that when i stood up it was facing straight out, right way up and all. when the skin was pulled tight (i.e when i bent my leg), the eyelid would open. 

genuinely at a loss here. i woke up thinking it was real. it felt so SO real. is there a meaning to this or did my brain just concoct this out of nowhere?",2024-05-07 20:26:55
583,Dreams,had a dream about my body looking weird ,"this has been bugging me a lot recently and i have body dysmorphia cuz i fell sick and skipped the gym so i lost A LOT of size. went from like 75KG down to 65 (10KG is like 20LBS. idrk the conversion but 20KG is 44 lbs) and it’s been playing w my mind but it’s not unusual. asked my gf and she didn’t have much of an answer and i laughed it off cuz it made me uncomfortable (the dream not my gf. the dream causes massive discomfort)

anyway so recently i had this dream when i was shirtless and i looked in this mirror. and i was me (obviously) but i looked so so different. my face was much more egg shaped and i had a lack of hair/ thinning hair and a thin neck but a double chin. as the dream progressed the “camera” panned down to show my torso and i had really really saggy **** like **** ig that looked almost cartoon but with a realism filter over it. they dropped really low and i had MASSIVE **** (my **** are small if not average IRL. either way far from morty’s eyes from rick and morty). anyway so i look lower and my what was 28 inch waist was MASSIVE again i looked just shy of obese. and was really wrinkly. i then had the MARVELLOUS idea to jump and they didn’t bounce but swing if that’s relevant but only a small amount. i think that’s everything at least

sorry if this isn’t the right sub for this post idrk where to post/ ask this question. i’m 18 M if it matters (blessed genetics for my small waist and wider shoulders) anyway thanks in advance i’ll try answer any questions as best as i can. thank you

So, I don't remember much about this dream. All i remember is that i dreamed that i was at work holding some scissors and accidentally sliced half of my pinky finger off.

587,Dreams,zero fear of horrific things in dreams,"Mushroom clouds and walls of fire, snakes whispering into my mind “be not afraid” before lunging at my throat, sinister weapons that seem poised for my back…

i’m fazed by none of it in the dream world until it “hits” me, whatever it is.  I am relatively unfazed by physical danger in the real world as well; climbing home improvement store-style racks with no ladder or harness, standing at the edge of a building, skydiving, talking to questionable people who I know are armed… I am far more frightened by things like losing my job/income, saying the wrong thing in a social situation, and being asked to be a part of social gatherings where I have absolutely nothing in common with any of the other participants.

Is there meaning behind this? I do have a history of depression; could this be a bit of anhedonia manifesting in the dream space as well as waking life?

I’ve also had multiple lucid dreams lately and they are becoming more and more common (i.e. maybe I’m just getting better at recognizing that I’m in a dream).",2024-05-07 19:33:32

Well back to dreaming. I‘ve Never dreamt about her, when we were still talking. And suddenly the last 2 weeks i‘ve been dreaming about her. At least 4 dreams, that i still kinda know stuff about. (I Dream basically every night, i can also Change stuff in my dreams but i mostly just let them play like i‘m watching a Movie bc it’s more fun). We don’t do anything special, just stuff we could‘ve Done in real life (nothing **** though). 

Why am i dreaming about her when i finally thought that i‘m getting over her? I wasn’t really thinking about her, maybe once a week. Now it’s more often bc of the dreams. ",2024-05-07 19:24:16

590,Dreams,Phantom pain from dreams? ,"I feel like I’m going crazy. I have had a reoccurring dream since as long as I can remember. In short- I have wings and I can fly. Sometimes, they painfully grow through the muscle and skin of my pain and break free. Sometimes I’m just flying. Sometimes… they are cut off. 

The problem is that I have weird phantom pain when I wake up- where my non existent wings would be. It can last hours to days like this. Like my body has decided they should exist but don’t.      

Is this insane or have other people experienced this too? I know I have a really vivid dream life- more than most people… but I want to know if this isn’t just a “me” thing. ",2024-05-07 18:38:29
591,Dreams,Dying in a dream(Almost) ,"I saw myself dying 3 times in a 3 different dreams. And 3 of them happened in a different way. And all felt strange. So i need some explanation of these dreams and i'll tell you. 

The first one i saw was taking place in my primary school. I went outside to the playground. Then startee raining heavily and there was a tree. I saw my dad with an old lady on a wheelchair. Both of them were looking opposite direction. First the lady turned her face on me with devilish smile then my father looked at me. After few seconds my dad pulled out a gun and shot me and i woke up. 

The second one is the strangest imo. In my dream i woke up in my room and it was a bit dark inside. Then my door opened then someone came inside. At first i didn't understand what's going on. With a brief moment that person leapt on me and tried to **** me with a knife. That person was wearing a black mask. I started to struggle and tried to escape. In the end while i was struggling i took of the mask and the person who were trying to **** me, it was me. Then i woke up with a great shock. 

The last one is recent one. I was in a torture room or something like that. I was standing and i was tied up. There was a torturer and i didn't see **** face. But there were another people who have been getting tortured. Then i found myself in front of my apartment entrance in a good condition. There was a ambulance in front of the apartment and i went to it. I saw an paramedic and talked to him. He said ""What are you doing here? "" I was suprised because everything felt normal. Then i asked to him ""What do you mean 'what are you doing here'? "" And he said ""You can't be here because you're dead"" I was shocked and i said ""How? I don't believe it"" After that he showed me the body bag in the ambulence. He said "" Come and see yourself "" He opened the body bag and i saw dead body of me. Then i woke up. 

These dreams made extremely uncomfertable yet massively strange. I don't know why but i feel curious about them. I really need some explanations. ",2024-05-07 18:36:34
592,Dreams,Hypnagogic Hallucinations ,"Does anyone else here suffer from hypnagogic hallucinations? its basically entering a dreamlike state while still in the process of falling asleep, for example, a lot of people can recall a time where they woke up, started scrolling on their phone, and the very next moment the phone was no longer in their hand, it never was. it is basically that but instead of during waking up, its while you’re falling asleep, making everything you experience seem real as can be, this has been troubling me quite a bit as of late, especially reading about it being an onset of schizophrenia, i was just wondering if anyone else deals with this and has a way to cope as it has been affecting my quality of life quite a bit.",2024-05-07 18:14:19
593,Dreams,Acid nightmare,"In the dream I was in a Skype call with a man covered in darkness, it was like when you see those interviews and the person talking is pitch black, he had an audible voice and said “we’re gonna have so much fun making tv together” I woke up terrified, his voice wasn’t deep but normal and the tone of his voice sounded like he was just making funny of me, before that happened I had a dream I committed suicide and my step mom cradled me in her arms, to preface I was on acid and I was on such a high dose I passed out, after the scene with the shadow figure I thought I had woken up and was on a group Snapchat call with all my friends making fun of me and tormenting me like demons, I woke up screaming.
I didn’t know you could fall asleep on acid, let alone have such realistic dreams",2024-05-07 18:09:35
594,Dreams,Similar dream my entire life,"Ok, so first let me say that although this dream starts with repetitive themes over my life it has branched out to be an entire crazy story that's still going. The place is the farm I grew up on. The theme is trying to escape from being held captive/murdered by man/men. My sister and mother both also have has these dreams just not as much as myself. So going back to small childhood around age 6 or so I have extremely vivid dreams.  I have one that later in life I would realize would be an alien abduction dream. Sleep paralysis, floating out of my bed, down the stairs and to the forest near my house where a relatively small ship sat with glowing lights. I remember it being dark but the walls had glowing screens/stuff on them. I don't remember the beings. Another dream I have around that age is of aliens doing a surgery on my private (female) parts. It did not hurt and I did not feel afraid. I do recall them eating flesh. This dream really has just always confused me. 

Now I've always been confused bc the Nonhuman intelligence is very often interconnected with supernatural events in my life that would seem unrelated other then both are super weird. 

So the dreams about the farm start. I'm a kid and I'm trying to escape. It's a large house small farm. I get killed trying to escape or wake up in fear. Ok so another night this dream is happening again and I remember in this dream how I died in the last one and know that I need to try something different. So variations of this dream are my main dream for the majority of my life. Just many many different versions of it.

I should clarify I have no traumatic event from the farm. It was a beautiful place that I still cherish in my heart. I moved away from there when I was around 15. I am now 36. 

What these dreams mixed with my other more alien-like dreams has become is this wild segmented sort of situation where I am either experiencing another timeline/dimension or I am fully aware of this complex situation where I am purposely traversing the multiverse with the help of other individuals in a very serious attempt to save (humanity?) There is like a ground 0 time line or something to that effect that I'm trying to prevent from experiencing a (cataclysmic?) event. To do so I am in various timelines trying to prevent events etc. There is something working directly against me that seems very much like it would be, I'm not sure what to call: the elites? Evil Corporate batman villains? They have successfully ended timelines and me and others are trying to prevent. In these dreams I've died and gone into the next similar timeline almost immediately. The movie everything all at once really flipped me out when I first started watching this. 


So like other then how intensely strange my dreams are I am a psychologically sound individual. My purpose in sharing this is that I am wondering if anyone else has ever experienced anything like this? I've of course left out 30 years of extra details but I think dreams are so interesting and in them I've tried to identify the people in them who claim to be real people outside of the dream world.

596,Dreams,Someone signing a contract dream meaning,"I had a dream where there were two cars, so basically the first car(infront) was the girl driving and the second car(behind the girl’s car) was his dad driving and with someone else and then suddenly the girl went another way (turned left) and somehow said that “we shouldn’t be going that way” between those lines. And then while driving, the girl had malfunction with her steering wheel to the point she tried to call her dad in the middle and his dad said that “you shouldn’t be going this way” Then, another scenario happened where the girl ended up somewhere place and a guy said that “you shouldnt be here” but since the girl was there, she was forced to signed a contract, then afterwards it led me to another scenario where i saw her head being displayed and the guy put a necklace around here. Note that, I was basically watching the girl in a third pov i guess but I was not generally with her…

What does this mean?? Did I just signed a contract with someone that I shouldn’t be?? I mean I didnt sign a contract in my dream but I saw the girl being forced to signed a contract…This is scaring me alot and making me overthink such…",2024-05-07 17:11:15

598,Dreams,Strange dream,"It wasn't a nightmare but the only thing I can remember from it was I was constantly surrounded by animal bones
Specifically cats and horses, and I could smell the stench of death and rot and I could still smell it when I woke up. Most of the bones were full skeletons, some with bits of rotten flesh and muscle still on them. The bones themselves were dry and greasy and some were slimy, I could feel them.

Aside from this dream being lucid, what could this possibly mean or signify? ",2024-05-07 17:01:07
599,Dreams,Worms in my brain,"This is both a dream I had and also a cry for help. I try ink it was 2 weeks ago might’ve been sooner might’ve been later o can’t remember I had a dream that I can’t quite recall. The only thing I remember of it is some people I know like family meme era and old friends standing around me in a circle while I was on the ground screaming at me 
“THERE’S WORMS IN YOUR BRAIN!”
and other things like
“THE WORMS ARE EATING YOUR BRAIN!”
And other things along those lines. I’ve been going thru a lot of life changes recently and lost about everything and have been highly paranoid, I haven’t been doing any drugs as of recent except maybe smoking a bowl every other week. The dream is just running through my head and it’s scaring the **** out of me, I feel like I’m losing my mind and like there’s actually parasitic worms in my brain and body eating me alive from the inside out. I don’t want to go to the hospital cause I don’t want to explain to my parents all of this. I don’t feel right and I don’t think this is the right place to ask but I don’t know what to do anymore.",2024-05-07 16:59:32
600,Dreams,Dream about peeing blood,"I have marked this as NSFW just in case because I am unsure of it belongs in NSFW.

The dream started out with me visiting California or moving back. At one point in the dream, I started to ****. I just assumed it was an accident, but then noticed it was red. It soaked my leggings in blood, my feet had blood splatters. I then said uhhh, we need to go to the hospital. We all get into the car, but for some reason we stopped for food. I don't know why I was ordering food in a store in blood soaked leggings. Then my grandfather appeared behind me (he passed last year). I said what a minute, why are you here, you're dead? He said ""Don't worry about it, go get checked"". After we got the food, we got back into the car and continued the journey to the hospital. I saw some paperwork that said ""may not live between 31 to 38 years old"". We aren't that far from the hospital, I see a guy who looked high as **** rush to the car with a gun, trying to open it, but the gun had no bullets so he went back to where he was. We then go back into a back alley to cut through to get the hospital. After we got to the end of the street, I ultimately perished.",2024-05-07 16:49:11
601,Dreams,Dreaming of a friend,"This sounds really ****, but I had a dream last night where I was in an intimate situation with a close friend of mine.

we kissed, but it felt very cold (actual temperature wise) and during it, his teeth changed and became smaller / sharper.

Dreams always interest me, so I was wondering how this one could be interpreted?",2024-05-07 16:48:34
602,Dreams,This dream is messing with my head,"This dream is messing with my head

So in my dream, I suddenly woke up and didn’t know where I was. I woke up staring at a fan and then started looking around. And I was in this relatively small room with this bed on the ground, bookshelf, computer and desk, and papers everywhere and that was about it. I was on the bed that was on the ground when I woke up. And while I looked around and I slowly got up, leaning against the wall trying to figure out what might’ve happened. I examined the room for a couple of minutes trying to piece together where I was.

And so I found some clothes, got dressed, and went out the door. And then I heard some talking in the other room and I walked towards it. And there was these two people, a girl and guy, and the girl said “Hey you’re up!~” and I was looking at her, trying to figure out who she was, and I guess she noticed that I was really off and she said something to the other person and he started to leave, and she aggressively waving to him as he left. And while he was leaving he said to me “Alright, I’ll see you later man.”

I said “later..” doing almost a double-take as he shut the door. And I slowly stared back at this girl and was she was smiling at me for a few seconds and suddenly went dead-pan, and then a smirk, and replied with “What?-“

Her smirk faded and she pursed her lips together and pushed it aside and shook her head to come towards her. And she playfully slapped her arms on mine and said “Hey listen, are you doing okay? You seemed kind of off today.”

I didn’t want to say anything that was especially blunt because frankly, she was really pretty and I said “I’m just confused I guess?” and she replied with “Yeah? Well, you’’ve had a lot on your plate lately with everything that’s been going on” and I looked at her, wrenching my face together in a way that you’d give somebody when you’re sort of confused or questioning something. And she gave the same puzzled look back.


And I realized I couldn’t really say much beyond this point, so I told her “I don’t remember- last night or- I’m just sort of confused” and she replied “Well, you went out with friends last night to celebrate that thing, remember? I remember hearing you stumbling back pretty late last night. Did you drink?-“ and I replied “I guess so?”

And she reached over to this tabletop with a notebook on it, grabbed it and handed it to me. And I looked at it and it was filled to the brim with writing. Some of it was just was random scribbling and writing, but a good swath of it was filled with some of the beautiful poetry you could ever see. And then I slowly looked up, still puzzled, and she was staring at me. And she raised her eyebrows and said “Remember?-“

And then, we talked for a bit. About the writing, and some other stuff for what seemed like awhile. She was explaining to me about how I wrote this and that, all while I still gave her this puzzled look. And then I remember yelling to her about something, about not remembering I think? And she said “I know, it’s a journey.” and she said “listen, your bag is in the other room, maybe that’ll help you remember last night?” all while smiling. And so I went into the other room and brought it back. And I opened up it up to find more of the same; notebooks and a book. And I glanced over, and she was staring at me. And I noticed that there was this thing in the middle of the book and so I opened it up. And there was this massive bag of drugs; specifically pills. And I glanced at her again and she stepped back. Looking like she was about to cry, and she whimpered “I-I thought you said you quit“

I saw it and was shocked and really couldn’t believe it was mine, but it was pretty apparent that I was probably addicted to drugs.


And so I ran out of the house as fast as I could, making sure to grab the bag, and ended up a couple of miles down the road. I frantically started looking through the backpack for anything that could help me remember any of this and I found a phone and shouted “P-Phone, ****!” and I started looking through messages and missed calls. And saw this one message of this guy that I was apparently closed with that texted me “Hey man, I’m really worried about you. Please give me a call whenever you can” so I did.

And it rang for a bit and he said “Hey man, I was actually just about to call you? Where are you?” And I gave him a street name and he gave me an address. I was only a half mile from his house, so I walked. And so I went into the house and he said “Hey boss, it’s been awhile.” while he was tinkering with this thing or whatever, all while not truly seeing his face. And I told him everything I could about not being able to remember. And he said “You had another bender last night didn’t you?”

And so he got up and grabbed a notebook that I had apparently left there. And he started explaining the writing I made. The symbolism, and critiquing this and that, and what really made him liked this writing in particular, all with a pretty heavy-handed degree of sophistication. After this, he hopped on his computer and showed this really serene music that was like nothing I’ve ever heard, it was just so- experimental.  Just the amount of different genres alone. and how good it all sounded, I actually couldn’t believe it. And he said I made it.

But towards the end of all this, he was going over this one aspect of my writing again and made a joke towards how terrible my handwriting was. And I replied “It’s not that ba-“ and I looked over and it was me. And then I looked back at the writing and did a double-take once I realized who it was and for a split second, he looked back with smirk. And that’s when I woke up.",2024-05-07 16:45:21
603,Dreams,Time travel through dreams.,"I’m not sure how to begin this, i’m still shaken up after the dream i had a couple hours ago… i ate and had some tea to try to calm myself down since waking up and i still feel sick. 

I decided i’d begin this with an experience i had when i was around 3-4 in my childhood home, i have a really bad memory and rarely remember anything around that age but what i experienced that one night i will never forget, the feelings most of all, Fear and confusion. 

Because of that sole experience, i have been having on and off dreams of my childhood home for years to come, they have increased after my college days possibly due to high stress. The dreams are not nightmares, but i do wake up with an eerie and empty feeling. 
Our childhood home did not feel haunted and was very much peaceful and cozy, when i share what i went through with my siblings they brush it off as “sleep walking incident”. We moved out when i was 9. 


Today i took a nap at 4 and woke up at 6, its 8 now and i’m not sure how i’m going back to sleep later tonight. I don’t usually nap as i have trouble with sleeping in general but when i do i end up having my one very surreal dream. Nothing scary all i do is walk around my childhood home. I still remember it so accurately due to these rare yet frequent dreams. I walk through the hallways and in and out of the kitchen, sometimes ill stop and look at our family photos. i never go into any of the other rooms or bathrooms because the doors are always closed. 

Back to the very odd night i had when i was a kid, i have absolutely no recollection of why i was out of bed in the middle of the night and outside my bedroom, in a very hazy memory i remember walking into the kitchen “possibly to get water?” and finding a shadowy figure walking around the kitchen, the shadow noticed me, paused and stared at me. and disappeared, i cried in my parents bed that night while my mom prayed in my ear to try to calm me down. 

I have never been able to fully explain my memory of that that night, like i said my siblings have always told me i had sleep walked while my friends believed it to be a ghost encounter, i have never been able to explain it until the dream i had today. 

I was walking around the kitchen looking into the glass cabinets when i heard footsteps, i turned and a saw my kid self looking back at me, i have never dreamt of a person so accurately before.. i didn’t look how i looked in photos, and i didn’t look how i looked in mirrors, i looked more real. 
I felt scared and confused and i woke up shaking.

604,Dreams,Dream Highlights,"I had segments of dreams throughout my morning. In the first, that I could memorize easiest; I was in the living room with my art teacher. She took over my living room, putting 'my so called life' on. The intro to columbia tristar played, so clearly. It felt as if I was actually there. *'Coming soon'* Audibly spoke through the air. I don't think it was 'coming soon to vhs' because it seemed more like a dvd that she put in. We were supposed to be getting ready for school. My mom scolded us, annoyed. Outside, we stood out on the front porch; posing for pictures. The victorian porch was all cleaned off, clear of stuff. The floorboards were green. Across the street there were fall leaves, you could see; orange with streaks of green in them. It was fall. We were going to back to school. I woke up from the dream, mentally reminding myself to write it down later.

For now, I'm gonna fall back asleep and see if I dream of anything cooler. The columbia intro/bumper unnerved me when I woke up, among another few things. I was anxious and that could've gave me a nightmare. In the next dream, which I can't remember well. I was in my bedroom, with my man. A few females were there. We were hanging out, probably talking about something. I could remember seeing his face, but not if anything was said; which always happens in my dreams. My brain must get too excited to memorize anything else. Hence, this post is detailed with all the other segments/minor symbolism. It makes everything else more memorable. I sat with him, staring into his eyes and face a lot.

I was at my sister's boyfriend's house, looking across at him, my sister, and my niece. Tvs were on the floor, one was getting put away. 'Nooo' I said. It made me sad. The tv was either late '00s or early 2010s. I don't know which, but it was from when I was last over there. Before I started isolating myself. What tv they were using at the time of my trauma. The tv could've been the same one from the '00s that they continued to use, I can't tell if it was ever replaced. I sat on the edge of the couch, turning to see my man sitting next to me. At one point, I followed him up the stairs. It didn't look like the staircase in my house, or theirs. It was wooden and victorian; it looked like the stairs to my sister's new house with her current husband.

I don't remember what happened after going up the stairs, it probably just led to my bedroom. Downstairs, I was listening to an alt rock playlist. Full of 90s music. The cursor was on the song, 'miss world.' He was beside me on the couch. The song 'celebrity skin' was playing. I laid upside down on the couch.

*'When I wake up, in my makeup.'*

I fell out of consciousness, unaware that I did so. Spaced out. I knew that I wasn't physically in reality for a second. Through the lucidity, I was able to separate the thought.

After waking back up within the dream, I realized how loud the volume was. It had got up to like 50. My niece was there, occupied with something in front of her. I turned the volume down, scared that it would wake my dad upstairs. Even though it was my man who was upstairs. Whatever music I was listening to before that song, which was something masculine; I chose not to play any more music. I put malcolm in the middle on, leaning against him. It was a episode with a tv show in it, hosted by kelly clarkson and some other lady, in supermarket sweep style. Boxes of disney magic cereal got my attention; pixar movies digital print on the front. Toy story, and something else, that I didn't pay any attention to because there was a monsters inc one. Memories of my mom showing me cgi appearances of mike and sulley on tv went through my head, her trying to tease and scare me. I turned over and saw my dad sitting next to me. I told him that, and he just started laughing. *'She would show me the cgi appearances of mike and sulley and tell me they were real.'* Or something along those lines, I said. And *'Try to scare me.'*

I went into the kitchen, hearing a song play on the radio. It was called, 'lilith in scorpio.' I recognized it. I heard it once before. Just one other time. I went towards the stairs, waiting for the announcer to say the title of the song. To know who the band was, likely. I went up the stairs, going into my bedroom again. The energy turned frenzy. It felt as if the first segment in here from earlier was more recent/real, as it felt nightmarish some more. I felt as if I had a dream in here before I went up the stairs; maybe the familiarity is from the segment from earlier. I think there was a nightmare that was going on before taking the stairs. The energy was negative as soon as I went into the room. I went straight for my dvd player, feeling how overheated it was. Some other technological device I had was also heated alot. Wonder if I was in two places at once? now that I think about it. I can see his smile in my memories/head, as if I was with him. I looked through the buttons on it, needing to turn it off. I must've left the tv on for hours. Maybe it was still playing when I was at my sister's house as well. I looked down at saw my partner had shape shifted into a cat. Black and white/tuxedo. *'Baby, I need to turn this off.'* I murmured, feeling his sentience. I had a red patch of skin over my ****, it was sore and almost veiny. There was a pimple on one side, or maybe it was actually a welt. I don't know if I got to turn the tv and vhs/dvd player off, there was something playing on the tv. I was about to wake up and I don't remember if I successfully turned it off. I could also feel the vibration coming from the vhs-dvd player when I placed my palm on it. He stood at the end of the room, watching me. I fondled my ****, pulling on it. It outstretched a little far, pointy. It was pretty, but swollen. It looked like there were cuts/nicks on the other side. I said his name lazily, shortening it. *'I need you to take me to the hospital...'* I grew nervous, seeing how bad the injuries looked. I woke up not long after, immediately after asking.

Fadelow, 'more than fiction' was playing through my head as I woke.",2024-05-07 15:59:18
605,Dreams,I finally had a cell phone in a dream!,"I was checking in to some kind of special facility that required me to keep certain items in a locker and all the details were on my cell phone including my room number etc. I spent a whole 3 days in this crazy dream facility where interactions with all kinds of random people didn't really make sense.  But I hadn't slept in my own room except the first day and so by the end of the dream I was thinking ""oh no I can't remember the number of my locker or where it is"" and then ""its fine, its in my phone still"" but I never followed through checking it a 2nd time for some reason. Like there was a kind of mental block keeping me from performing the action.

It wasn't all bad. There was this random girl there who kept trying to discreetly invite me to make out, but I had no idea who she was and she wouldn't tell me. She kept talking in this ASMR voice and I couldn't understand most of what she was whispering to me. 

The rest of the dream was just like being **** and lost in this huge hospital / university like place, getting confused about which room was mine and trying to talk with people who wouldn't give me answers.  At the end, some big dude grabbed my neck in a choke hold / hug something in between those and dragged me outside in a semi-aggressive manner. Then I finally woke up!",2024-05-07 15:56:37
606,Dreams,"Watched an earthquake, bit by a dog, crushed by a building","I was watching the Australian Open on TV, and there was an earthquake. There were hundreds of people on screen, and the ground opened up, and people got swallowed.

  
The scene switches but it's the same dream, and I know about the earthquake. My dog is getting attacked by another dog, so I pull the other dog off. He bites me. Over time more and more blood comes out, it's a little surprising. The owner doesn't apologize to me.



I'm in the US Open stadium, and I have this feeling that I should leave, so I walk towards the entrance. 50 feet from the entrance, an earthquake starts, and the building starts sinking in, but as if the ceiling is wet. It's blocking my route, and slowly sinking in around me. I realize this is the end for me. For some reason I think, if I think hard enough, maybe I can redo this.

  
So I unintentionally forced myself awake.

  
It wasn't a particularly scary dream, I would describe it more as disturbing.",2024-05-07 15:25:40
607,Dreams,I die in all my dreams,"I'm 18 and autistic I'm not sure if that will help but I'm saying it anyway incase it's the cause somehow. I've been having these dreams consistently over years and it's gotten to the point where I need help. every night I will have EXTREMELY realistic dreams of me or my family or my friends or partner dying in my dreams in the most abhorrent and gruesome and gory ways possible I hate it and it's messed with my real life in a way because I will jump awake and call the person from my dream who ""died"" to check if there ok because it looks that realistic. sometimes it'll mess with my memories and make me think people have been dead for years when nothing bad ever happened. An example of these dreams would be when I was torn apart for what felt like hours in a completely white room by chains on each of my limbs slowly and when I finally died I woke up in a dark void almost as if that was the afterlife I'm just tired of these dreams affecting my sleep and my daily life and even my friendships is anyone able to help me?",2024-05-07 15:09:40
608,Dreams,black cast/ shadow?,"for as long as i can remember my grandma has had these day dreams and dreams. what happens is she always sees something like a black cast of color or shadow go over her head or from behind her. the oldest one i can remember is when she was standing in the kitchen cooking, my mom who was in the room as her what was wrong because she looked terrified. she ask my mom and me if we had a weird feeling or saw anything black above us a few seconds ago. we both said no. not even a week later we were driving (me in the backseat) we were about to pass a patch of woods on the side of the highway and before we get to it she tells me that i need to get down between the front and back seat because the black cast she saw was a tree about to fall on us, i do as she says and she swerves and a giant tree falls on the car. the most recent one was when she had a dream that a black cast came from behind her and she said it felt as if she flew forward. less than a week later she somehow falls and is more than 5 feet from when she fell making it look like she flew forward. does anyone know what this is or could be??",2024-05-07 14:48:16

One thing I wanna point out in the dream is that her hair color changed from blonde to brown. I myself, went through a big change with my hair color so maybe this could be related to me missing my blonde hair? Lol. What could this dream possibly mean? ",2024-05-07 14:36:34

I don’t remember the talk i had with that lady but she seemed very familiar to me yet when all that upcoming act happened i had no sympathy for her. We were given some food in our bowls, i think it was mac n cheese. Suddenly in the room, there appeared a screen. Screen was showing gore explaining how human should be cut into various varieties of food and other stuff and organs were put into plastic bags directly with hands from the body and were being crushed by punches. I kept eating while watching it while that lady was terrified, soon enough, all that stuff was done to that lady in front of me, there were no humans it all happened in air, her head was cut like chips and body meshed like a potato.

614,Dreams,Lady standing in the woods,"I had a dream last night that I just can't stop thinking about. 

For some back story, I have two dogs and there's a **** fence in the backyard that one of them bulldozes his way through from time to time. There's a little patch of woods and a creek behind the fence, so he likes to get out and walk around the creek. There's also a big tree right the middle of our yard.

So, in the dream, I was outside with the dogs. The weather was nice and I was sitting on the patio watching them play. As I was watching, one of my dogs bulldozes his way through the fence and starts heading for the creek. I saw him do it so I called out to him and he ran around the fence to the gate so I could let him back in. Him and my other dog start to play again and I turn my attention to the fence. The fence didn't look broken so I cross the yard to sit back down. I glance back up at the fence, but from where I'm sitting I can see from the other side of the big tree. More specifically, I see a lady standing there on the other side of the fence. She wasn't looking at me, she was facing the other way, looking out towards the creek and the woods. She had long straight blonde hair and was wearing a white dress. I stared at her but she didn't move. The dogs are still playing, they don't react to the lady at all and I'm just sitting there staring at this person I don't recognize on the other side of our fence. I don't call out to her or move, I'm frozen in place. I stay frozen like that until her head moves, just an inch to the side and I jump up. I go to the door, the dogs follow and run into the house. I look back, from the other side of the tree and she isn't there anymore. I close the door and step across the patio so I can see from the other side of the tree. She's standing there again, her face turned back towards the creek. I go inside and look out from my bedroom window. She's still there and seems closer to the fence now but she isn't looking at me yet. When she starts to turn her head again, I close the blinds and then I woke up. 

I looked outside when I woke up, just to check and obviously she's not there. But now I'm outside with the dogs on this nice day and staring out at the woods. There's a bush of honey suckle on the other side where she would've been standing. I'm walking back and forth looking on both sides of the tree just to make sure she doesn't suddenly appear.

Anyone have any thoughts on this?",2024-05-07 13:57:24
615,Dreams,Dream abt ex + weird life circumstances,"I had a weird **** dream that my ex and I hung out a bit. It was a very sweet time. I don't remember most of it except for the part where we hugged in his car before he dropped me off at the movies. He just sorta said bye and dropped me off there.  It's like he couldn't come with me. For the past few months, I've been in and out of hospitals for chest pains and what are presumed to be panic attacks but they're not. What does this dream mean??  


Edit: had a dream before that where my cat and I couldn't breathe walking up and down stairs.

The first nightmare I remember having was when I was 7. I was in an all-white room, so I looked around to find anything. I saw my friend lying **** on her stomach, as a snake slithered over her. The snake had a razor blade as a stomach, so as it went along her, she was sliced open and bleeding out. She was still the whole time but screamed and started to turn purple and white. The more she bled, the more her skin wrinkled like it was being suctioned to her bones. 

When I was 18, I couldn't remember the last night I had a normal dream or a good night's rest. It was constant nightmares over and over. My friend told me that he didn't dream because he smokes ****. I went to get a medical card and I finally stopped dreaming. 

However, **** is not legal everywhere and I travel a lot. Recently, at the age of 21 now, I had a weekend without nightmares, or ****, and I got good sleep. I decided I would stop consuming mary J and deal with the dreams I was having. They weren't nightmares, but eventually, I would end up saying 'this is a dream'. After a few nights of knowing I was in a dream, I had the worst nightmare I have ever experienced. 

(My house contains myself, my boyfriend, and two dogs.) I ""woke up"" in bed because a hand was grabbing my leg from the side of my bed. I thought 'Did we leave the door unlocked? did someone get in the house? No, the dogs would have barked.' I looked around and in my hand was a piece of paper that had writing.  ""if you feel a hand it is syphicias. IT IS SYPHICIAS"" After reading the name, I actually woke up, terrified. I could still feel the sensation of where the hand was on my shin so I didn't want to move. 

Since then, I have gone back to MJ to keep my dreams at bay, but It's expensive for one. I also don't like the fact that I'm dependent on it for sleep. I just want to be normal, but so far when i try, I wake up exhausted from my nightmares, or if I don't have them I have a hard time telling what's real or not. The times I know I'm in a dream are really uncomfortable because they're not what I would consider normal. For example, I wouldn't consider this a nightmare because I wasn't scared but It's uncomfortable- My dad had squirrels on his fingers and he crushed their heads one by one and I said it was so the raccoons know what will happen to them if they misbehave. 

I've googled too many times why I have nightmares, realistic dreams, and why I remember them 90% of the time. I have yet to meet someone who dreams as often and as interestingly as I do. I've experienced phases of depression, I've been stressed. But I'm also very happy and stress-free when nothing changes, so I'm not sure those two things are the cause. I have a normal sleep schedule, going to bed at 8-9. I eat 3 meals a day and exercise. I have a good work school life balance. I try to read before going to bed as well. 

I shared my first nightmare above when I was 7 because I'm not sure most 7-year-olds would be able to imagine a situation like that. I have never seen a movie or show, still to this day, that would help my mind visualize that. I also shared it because as I've grown older, seeing and experiencing more, my dreams have grown more intense. I've seen so many people and animals die or be tortured. I've made what I would call monsters I guess? I've been in tornados, had my face peeling off and bashed. I've been bitten and poisoned, I've had my teeth fall out(which was actually common) 

I don't really know what kind of answer I'm looking for completely. If it's why I have these kinds of dreams, or if there is a way to make it stop without taking anything. I am religious, and this breaks my heart, but the more I practice my faith, the worse my dreams get.. I sometimes feel like if I stay stronger in my faith it will help eventually, but I get so scared and it's easier to stay minimal. Like I said it hurts not being strong enough to face the fear. 

With the information I was able to share, I'm hoping someone will have some sort of knowledge, idea, or input on my post. If you took the time to read it, thank you.",2024-05-07 13:19:30
619,Dreams,Windows,"Hey hey,

Last night I had a dream that I was on what looked like a sun porch with windows all around. It was night time and I started to close them for the night, but I heard noise like someone was mowing a lawn outside. I looked at the last window and debated whether to close it or not, and I didn't, saying to myself, ""I'll leave that one open"". There was someone with me but I couldn't tell who it was, maybe my wife. The windows looked like the older wooden framed windows. I didn't recognize the house I was in. Any thoughts?",2024-05-07 13:04:11
620,Dreams,The most frustrating dream,"Hi, for context I broke up with my ex 1 year ago and I would say yes this is my first love. Fast forward to present and I still think about her from quite often but in a fleeting memory. I am with someone new now and so is she. 

Recently i’ve been thinking about her too much. I was taking my final and I kept thinking about her, how she’s doing with a new person how it’s all going. It completely distracted me. 

The biggest thing ever is I had a dream with her in it, not her but everyone new she had met. It felt like I was so drowned in her new life it was killing me. I woke up in a sweat and frustration.

I’ve had these dreams with her for a while now and they’re **** me off, it feels like I haven’t moved on yet and It just makes me frustrated.

I don’t know why this is happening to me, i’ve moved on from her and found a beautiful girl that I like being with and stuff like this still haunts me. 

Please could someone help me with this, or maybe advise me on a practitioner to visit.",2024-05-07 12:56:01

I awoke still afterwards with immense fear, and my head feeling dizzy like the room was spinning. Iv had many dreams recently be about **** religion and am unsure why, I dreamnt of speaking to **** at one point in that dream he told me he was proud of my garden i did and he asked me to show the way to someone he brought to me. I did so and he came back years later and was proud of me and asked if I wanted to wrestle with him, we did and i was no match but genuinely remember never feeling more happier.

622,Dreams,Yall have celebs in dreams ?,"Last night I had a dream I was shopping at a grocery store with Ewan McGregor lol it was winter and we had a lovely chat about Christmas cookies.  My roommate said he had a dream last night too about an incident that happen to him years ago when he was looking for his car in Chicago but in the dream Bruce Willis was there helping him. 

It got me thinking about some memorable Celeb dreams I've had in the past.

Johnny Depp told my dad off at a Bonfire cause he wouldn't shut up. But like in that **** chill Johnny Depp way, I remember he told my dad he was ""Just the worst."" I laughed so hard at that one, and so did everyone else at that bonfire. 

Jeff Bridges. I had a bad relationship with my mom but would still worry about her some times cause she was alone for decades. One night in my 20's I had a dream Jeff Bridges came to me like he was **** or something, he told me to stop thinking about her and worrying cause she was gonna get married and be fine. Even showed me her house, and then it came true a few years later. He said alot of other ethereal stuff. It was strange. 

Dang I know there were some others but they just flew outa my head. I'd love to hear yalls celeb dreams! ",2024-05-07 12:28:25
623,Dreams,Physical Pain After Alternate Universe Dream,"I had a dream I kept going in and out of an alternate universe. There was something horrible happening in my current universe and I wanted to escape, I saw a physical divide from my universe and the alternate universe. I crossed into the alternate universe and everything in the alternate universe was rose colored; like not objects or people, just the air?? I don't know how to describe it. I met a few new people and people I knew in my universe but they looked kinda different. Nobody recognized me but I recognized them. At one point I felt sad that I abandoned my two friends, so I wanted to go back to my universe to tell them to come to the alternate universe. There was a floating book that appears at random times and I have to enter it in order to go back to my universe. I went back and everything in my universe changed, like everyone was living in a boot camp world. I met up with my two friends, who were sneaking out of a building that was surrounded by barbed wire. I had to quickly tell them about the alternate universe, but as soon as I started, a woman (who I guess was in charge of keeping everyone from escaping) came out with some kind of taser paddle and used it on my friends, I tried to run away and she used it on my lower back, and I thought she would back off after using the taser paddle on me, but she kept pushing the paddle harder on the same spot. I woke up from the dream right after and felt this tingling  pain from the same exact spot dream me got tased.",2024-05-07 12:22:41
624,Dreams,I am creating random universes in my dreams,"The meaning of this: Last night I had a dream I went into my school classroom and there was a random man telling me to go to the middle to summon something. Everyone was watching and I thought “oh must be important” I summoned it and guess what? I created a portal. The portal led to a weird universe where nothing was real. School? Shut down “for fakeness”. Fast food restaurants? Shut down “for fake food”. So basically me and my parents weren’t real and I was scared for my life. I saw a portal and needed 250 “bucks” which were actually coins. I picked up a few and got back. My class, with their English test papers in front of them, and my teacher and were watching in absolute horror. I muttered “oh well it’s a funny story” and ran my way through a series of hallways and an out of nowhere voice tells me “Wake up”.

And that’s when I woke up.
It was like an hour long but that’s a short explanation of it. Also the “Wake up” was said in IRL too. My grandpa was trying to wake me up for a plane flight and he shook me and said “Wake up”, which made its way into my dream.

I was having “dream episodes” that night, as I had three dreams that night.",2024-05-07 12:08:08

I panicked and used the shark to shield myself from the alligator. The alligator started attacking the shark and bit my hand but I was able to swim to safety and the shark died and I woke up.

Normally I just chalk my dreams up to being weird with no meaning. But I've been awake for 5 hours and can't stop thinking about it and I feel guilty I sacrificed the shark.

629,Dreams,So realistic horror dream. Please can someone tell me about it.,"Hello to everyone. This dream is long so if you want to read it will take 4-7 minute's. People and real location's will be changed.

So i was with 10 of my friend's and we are drinking and have fun at our usual spot in city. It was a day and we decided to go on mountain close to our city to join few more people and this part is pretty normal. But when we arrived at destination we go to find 2 other friends that was fishing. Me and two other friends ( I will call then Filip and Mark ) go to this guy's and sit with them and talk, afther talk that seems so real like it's not a dream little earthquake start and we fall in river and that part of dream stop. I woke up in some remote village on river ( Like you can see in Southern Asia in fishing village's, but im from Europa ) and I don't see my friends  im alone on dock( the part of body i hurt in river rly hurt me right now when i write this ). I start to walk around it was endless city but empty and afther few minutes i found one guy i know and he was crying and beginning me to help him but I don't know how since he don't want to walk with me dipper in the so call city/village, so i left him do find a boat, police, anything to go away. And afther sometime i made a full circle and go again and then on same spot find another person i know but i didn't see for 3-4 years. He was like I don't care i will go to swim from this and he just left. I still walk around and see 2 older lady's ( in their 50s mby 60s and ) and few little kid's, i start to run to ask them where am i and fall in front of them. They start to look at me and tell me to enter a school, then i go inside and see 70-90 kid's that was so familiar. I understand that was all missing or killed kid's from my country or country's around me in past 5 year's all of them are crying and beginning for help i ask them to come with me but they don't want to leave they just cry so loud or laugh. I see to little baby's ( few months old ) and i grab them to at least help them and when i pick them up they turn head for 180° and look so mutalated and terrible like demons and start ro scream in that time I didn't woke up and i just put them on bed and run by at door i see 9 older lady's look at me and start to become so demonic and saying something I didn't understand it sound's like some Arabic language or Jewish ( it was not latin or roman im sure 80% ). And when i try to run other way kid's are missing and i woke up. I still feel goosebumps when i write this because It was so realistic i never have a dream I can't wake up and fell everything like i was there!

Mby long but it was the worst and biggest horror to me. PS i don't watch horror movie's so im sure it was not influence by that.",2024-05-07 10:35:32
630,Dreams,I have created different dimensions in my dreams?,"Long story short, I have had very vivid dreams since childhood and they are almost nightly ( with very few exceptions) They range from fun adventures, to nightmares, to conversations with people I saw earlier in the day, etc. One thing I have noticed though is that there are certain dreams I have where they take place in the same areas, places I have created solely in my mind, not that I have seen before. One example is cobblestone street that has a corner cafe style shop I tend to frequent often and the stores/ curbs in the sidewalk/ etc. are always the same but what is happening in the dream itself is always different? What is the possible reason for this? (That was just one example)

It also is possible for me to go multiple years without being in one of those “dream worlds” but whenever I do go back to that scene it is still the exact same and I remember everything. ",2024-05-07 10:07:44

635,Dreams,Anxiety and Panic Dream,"I had a dream that I’m confused about and it’s causing me a bit of anxiety. It started off as a very calm, fun day. I don’t know the location of my dream, I have never been there in real life. It looked like a hotel with a stadium attached to the side. There was some type of event going on at the stadium but I could not tell what it was. Some of my real life friends and some total strangers were headed to the event together. On the drive there we noticed some fires being put out on the side of the road but it looked controlled, nothing alarming. We got to the hotel and found our rooms, the rooms were located below ground level. We started putting our items away in the rooms and made are way back out to the hall. As we walked down the hall we started seeing smoke and little burst of fire. Everything was full panic mode after that. We started running to escape the fire, by this time some other hotel guest joined us. The halls were packed, like a full crowd crush. I lost some of my group but the ones who made it were the people I could not recognize. We could not escape through any of the doors, for some unknown reason, so we made are way to and outdoor patio that was surrounded by high walls. We started to climb the walls and a crowd of people started to climb too. The panic on the walls just as extreme as the panic in the halls. The panic caused some people to fall. The rest of my group did not make the climb to the top. When I reached the top I could see the whole stadium was burning. Past that it looked like the whole world was burning. This entire time the dream was silent, I couldn’t hear any sound until the very end and the only sentence I said was “the day we all burned.” I woke up after that and its like I could feel the heat on my skin from the fire I even had these weird little hives on my leg. I thought I got bit by something so I started checking my bed but couldn’t find anything. I feel like I’ve been on edge all day now. What does fire mean in a dream? ",2024-05-07 09:43:22

637,Dreams,Help me understand??,"Wondering if caused by my ADHD due to the craving of the event/fear/adrenaline once I've woke up?

Recent thing. I go to sleep, takes and hour or two, fine. I don't take any medication ever during the day or night. Doesn't matter whether I go to sleep anxious or not, this happens.

I'll half wake up at about either 2 or 3am. And I have this feeling of adrenaline and fear. I'll hear real noises around me yet I hyper focus on them (they sound louder than they are) and all of them cause fear. I can move and open my eyes but out of fear I don't. I usually have music in my head 24/7, stuff like Set It Off or TX2 ect ect. But in these moments I'll have to conciously fight myself(!) to not make it sound scary. In the most cliché of ways, like off keys or getting super loud in my ears (like ear ****).

Last night I heard this low buzzing noise, like an electric fence, right next to my right ear. And in my head I vividly saw my pet bird eat from this weird plastic-like batton thing. Then a quick snap as it closed on his head and killed him. I have no seen anything like this or have fears about my canary. That visual thrn left my head and was replaced by, again very cliché, distorted black and white faces with tiny black pupils staring right at me. Then I'll just... go back to sleep and wake up fine (at the usual time I wake up reguardless of this event). Even if I remember the event in vivid detail it's not scary once I've woke up.

The thing is, I don't watch cliché horror films or games. They bore me. And even if I do, they never scare me. But weirdly as soon as I wake up I'm left craving that fear and adrenaline again??

This doesn't happen every night, but happened for about 3 nights in a row, stopped for a week then started again last night.",2024-05-07 09:21:36

It was suppose to be like a 3 day trip. I think I remember talking to one of the girls about having another girl join us intimately, it was really weird because it’s like I knew the other girls, but get this it wasn’t just one more, it was like 3 more. I remember being in the bed surrounded by these women, I was happy, they were happy and really beautiful, it was really crazy for me. However there was a crazy turn of events, on the second day the owner of the house came with cops, talking about the partying that’s been going on with me and the girls, apparently she had something of value in the house and she was seeking that it was still there. At first it seem like the item was missing but shortly one of my girls in the dream found it, but then the dream takes a twisted turn on the next day… out of nowhere there’s like helicopters and fighter jets blowing things up… using napalms and what not my surrounding was like gone besides the house I was in with the girls. at that point in time the girls were panicking, as I called all of them and we got together and cuddled.

640,Dreams,dream of casting out demon from room,"Earlier this year I had a vivid dream of me attempting to cast out a demon from my room. Last night, I had a similar dream. Again, I could feel an evil spirit/demon but i could not see it just as in the previous dream. In the dream when I made the sign of the cross and the entire room would shake along with the ornaments on the Christmas tree that was there as well. It was as if the power would also give out as the lights flickered when I did it. I remember casting it out, I remember invoking Christ's name. In the dream I remember myself practically yelling at it and the most vivid part was me yelling that ""its the reason why nothing works out for me"". My mom was there and was sprinkling salt in the room as well. 

 In the same night, prior to this I had dream where I was in a building, and there was a gathering. The building was old, but not run down. The only person familiar in that dream was the older priest in the church that we go to(sadly, mostly just on holidays). That part had an overall pleasant feeling, unlike the later part in which, I could almost feel the fear of the evil entity that was being cast out ",2024-05-07 09:06:34

642,Dreams,"Dreams about doors that are portals to other countries, cities or sewers","So I had this dream two times, one is the sequence of the other. In this dream, some random doors are portals to other cities or countries. In the beginning, I was playing with it, traveling between two countries, but then I went through a door and there was no comeback. This door led me to a sewer or something, like a hall with some other doors, and each of these doors led to different countries, so I went through each one of them and talked to some people on the other sides, but each time I went back to the hall, it was different, with different doors that could get me to different places. Now, some of the doors could get me to other halls, each time more strange and dark. This sewer also had some hallways really dark, and at the end of them, there were other doors.

After some time trying to get home, I went through a door that led me to a place with monsters, and I had to run. Some monsters didn't do anything, and they would not mess with me until I messed with them. Some others were just staring at me. This place was like a desert, sometimes cold, sometimes dark. I finally found a door in the middle of the desert, but I just got to the sewer again (a different one).",2024-05-07 08:50:25
643,Dreams,Dodgeball Theory,"So this morning I slept in, I kept waking up but I was too tired to get up. Eventually, I dozed off and had a dream. The dream took place in my high school courtyard/hallways. In the dream there was two teams unofficially split up teams and I was on the team with about 25% of people and the other team had the remaining 75% of people. I don’t really remember what happened in the first few moments of the dream but I remember playing dodgeball, with air soft guns. But it was weird because my team had air soft guns and the other team didn’t, they had regular dodgeballs. So while playing dodgeball, I vividly remember shooting people with the air soft gun and they got out. Let me remind you that I was in the courtyard, the courtyard has a door that goes back into the hallway. After a while of playing dodgeball in the courtyard I decided to run back into the hallway and get my people to help me because I was the only one out there playing. So, I ran in and got some of my teammates, as I was opening the door to go back outside into the courtyard, I saw a person holding up a ball screaming, “I caught your ball you’re out!” This is weird because I didn’t question it at all and I made my way back inside because that’s where you went if you got out. Keep in mind that I had no control over this dream, I wasn’t lucid dreaming. It’s weird because even though I’ve played dodgeball hundreds of times in my life and I completely understand the idea of the game, it shows that my brain doesn’t. Because logically, I didn’t throw the ball, but the person in my dream tricked my brain into thinking that I should’ve been out. I don’t understand it and it just fascinates me that our subconscious understands some things but not all.



By the way everyone, please don’t come after me if I said some terms incorrect or something of that matter. I don’t know much about dreams so I’m just trying to share my experiences and see what other people think. Thank you.",2024-05-07 08:34:13

We broke up 10 years ago but I’ve been having dreams about him for over a year. They tend to happen in bursts where I’ll have several dreams about him in a short period of time and then nothing for a while. The dreams are not the same but they typically revolve around reconnecting. It’s worth mentioning that he was a pretty unemotional and stoic guy in high school but in my dreams he is portrayed as more emotional and sensitive and kind. They’re not explicitly **** (we did not really engage in a lot of **** activity at the time due to our age when we dated), but they do have a lot of hugging and touching. We dated only about a year and a half (but a pretty good chunk of our time in high school). 
I really can’t say I still miss him or have any feelings about him now because we have not spoken in YEARS. I’ve heard myths that if you keep dreaming of someone that means they’re thinking of you. Am I supposed to reach out to him? What does this mean??? ",2024-05-07 08:21:10

649,Dreams,"Dreaming of a lot of bloodshed, blood and dead bodies?","This is a long read mb 

TL;DR : A protest at my gmas neighborhood turned into a catastrophe as people committed mass suicide by staking themselves in the heart, very graphic, a ton of blood everywhere, red sky, body parts. I could feel everything very very vivdly, what does this dream mean?

The setting is that I was at my grandmas house, that is in a very traditional moroccan neighborhood. There is a little garden/plaza/ road space right in front of the house that is connected to a souk, but that day there was a peaceful protest, i was flying around (this flying in the air is somethinng that always happens in my dreams, my form while flying is basically just batting my legs as if I was swimming, it takes a looot of effort and I always wake up sweaty ash) laughing, but protestors took it badly and thought I was laughing at them (whatever the cause was I remember I agreed with them and it made me sad/embarrassed that they thought i disagreed)  got inside of grandmas house through the front door, weather became grey outside and dark and grey inside of the house that is very blue for some reason, i hear screaming and see blood outside of the window, the bloodshed eventually got inside of the house, it smells like blood everywhere, I see myself in the mirror and I have blood everywhere especially around my eyes, i am in the bathroom hiding and crying, there is half of someones **** body stuck in the window, like they were about to escape, her left leg was cut off or ripped off and she was white. organizers or just big guys (very human not out of the ordinary) laughing and praising the bloodshed, people commiting suicide, I am confused. I push on the dead body so i can leave through the window (groin area) i can feel the skin and the texture, everything, and it falls down, im crying even harder. I look down and its a truck full of dead **** bodies, some decapitated, some not (all fuuuully covered in blood), i did not see a single head though. I did see a black woman that voluntarily went in the truck to die, she looked super casual she was chewing gum and she looked at me kind of annoyed and then I flew out of the window. While getting out of the window, though, i slipped and had to hold onto some latches on the outside, kinda like assassins creed. The big guys/organizers were laughing at me and it felt like they were trying to pull me down with them, i flew away though, and i could LITERALLY FEEL my legs burning(as in muscle burning not fr burning) as i swam/flew away. I then i think landed? near a car and there was even more blood and now everyone was screaming so loud and there was just a river of blood everywhere and the sky was red and cars speeding and everything. In the car, my grandma was driving, i think an uncle or something was in the passengers seat and I was in the back with my bff. They were very lighthearted, like this is just totally normal and I was screaming crying at everything. Another weird thing is, myself, the car and everything else was covered in blood but they were pristine. I asked them why people died and how a protest turned into this and my bestfriend, with a smile, said that some people chose to stake themselves in the heart as the ultimate form of protest. I started to speak, then a woman in a green hijab/niqab (everything but her eyes were covered, though it came undone sometimes) approached us, she wanted to get inside the car. I screamed no to my grandma and to just get us out of there because I still didn’t know where my mom was (insanely worried) and she was still in the first house and people had gotten inside that house (didnt know if she was dead or alive, even though when i last saw her she was smiling too, like my bff, like the big guys/organizers)My grandma opened the trunk for her and didn’t open the doors thank the looooord i was so relieved but still. The woman.was.so.slow oml she was impossible. She couldn’t jump in the trunk because my grandma still had to drive forward obvi so the car was moving, she couldn’t get in and i kept on insisting that we ditch her and just go but my gma was not about that. Eventually we had to make a turn and we almost lost her, to which my bff GOT OUT OF THE CAR to go look for her and I screamed and cried and yelled for her to comeback and then I woke up. Why could I smell the blood, see myself in the mirror, and feel dread and fear like I have never felt before, like I was losing everything? I could feel every single emotion, physical effort, it was so vivid, also the fact that I could remember the dream long enough to write it down is crazy. I’ve only had one other really memorable dream, where people screamed a lot and there was a lot of **** people burning and screaming, but never ever with blood and with seeing myself in a mirror.",2024-05-07 07:36:09
650,Dreams,Dream diary day 4: Benedict Cumberbatch roasting the life out of me,"Benedict Cumberbatch was doing some sort of tour, in a school, as if it was an art gallery.
I was there with a group of people, following him along the hallways, listening to him commenting on stuff.
I was starting to get sort of frustrated, because I kept ending up at the very back of the group, so I was just looking at the back of people's heads and I couldn't see Wimbledon Tennismatch.
After a while, I dediced that I payed some decent dreambucks for this, so I sure as heck was planning on enjoying it. I gathered my courage and spoke up. I said something along the lines of ""Can I move to the front please? I keep missing everything because I constantly end up in the back.""

The man straight up ignored me, as did everyone else, and we started walking again.
We eventually entered a classroom filled with chairs (no tables) and one of those teacher chairs that was facing the other chairs (clearly for Benevolent Cookiebatch). 
He entered the classroom before the rest of us did, walking all rushed and he seemed super ****. He grabbed one of the chairs and dragged it all the way to the front, super aggresively, so that the chair was like a few inches away from the teacher's chair.
He gave me a very passive aggresive glare, and he was like ""Well? Sit. You wanted the front. Go. Sit there.""

I snorted and walked over to the chair.
Suddenly there was another woman in the room, some sort of hostess, and she kindly and unassumingly asked me if I had bad eyesight or something, and I sort of smirked and said ""Nah, he's just doing this to prove a point and I'm playing along."" 
So I took a seat at the front, and the rest of the people took their seats behind me, and then Benedict just started absolutely roasting me, ****!
""Are you satisfied now? At the front? Like you wanted? People like you disgust me. Not here to enjoy my work, nooo, you're only concerned with wanting to be seen, wanting attention, wanting a shot at succes. Did you hope I would see you and offeren you a role in a movie or something?""

Soooo mean. It's hilarious now, but at the time, in the dream, I felt so embarrassed and called out.

652,Dreams,Recurring dream about home intruder ,"Hi, I’ve been having dreams about people being in mu homes unexpectedly. I have had different dreams with the same general idea for a few months (maybe 5-10 times). They do not struggle to get in or anything like that. Simply, I turn the corner and my dream basically jumpscares me. The “people” have been a slender man looking figure and then regular people. They just look at me (sometimes smiling but not in a scary way). Usually I scream in the dream, fall down in the dream, and then wake up screaming or gasping.
I am wondering what these dreams could mean and how to stop them 😣. I do not want to wake up screaming.
Any help or opinions are appreciated.",2024-05-07 07:23:02
653,Dreams,Recurring dream about someone breaking into my childhood home ,"I’ve just woken up from yet another dream of someone breaking into my childhood home. I’ve been having them a few times a week. My estranged twin brother is also always there. 

It’s always the same. We come home. As I’m closing the garage door a car and a van pull up and a man advances to the door to enter the house. I lock it, giving us a few moments to turn off all the lights, hide, and attempt to call the police. I always wake up once they enter the home. 

It’s just messing with my sleep so much. Perhaps there’s something in my waking life I need to work on. I’m not sure. 

Please help, what does this mean. ",2024-05-07 07:03:11
654,Dreams,Love dream like a fog.,"Hello, I have had a... dream, kind of weird and maybe wholesome.

I can not remember the beggining thus I will start with the first memory. It all happened, at some point, in the town I actually live in. I was in a relationship with a woman who had a partner before, ex-boyfriend who was not well remembered by her, he was a **** and probably had some problems with controling his anger. Later in the dream it turned out they had a child, a daughter, but maybe the dream just started to mix everything up as I was waking up; she was still young anyway, I think not older than 25. Our relationship was something like a friendship turning into romantic relationship, partnership. She had two best friends – a woman kinda younger than her or of the same age, and a 18 or 19 years old woman. I can not remember any names so the first one, with whom I was in a relationship, I will call here Anne and her friends: Peg and Daphne. I think Anne was at some point related to Quebec or Ireland or both of them.

I was walking with Anne through the city, we were talking and laughing from time to time; it was giving some sort of warmth to my heart. Then we entered the grocery store but I can't remember this scene. The same with walking in the market in the evening, it is an old town, surrounded by city lights.

I forgot to tell that Anne was collecting some sort of cards as a hobby. I do not know if those cards exist in real life. Their size is similar to human hand, on the first page there is an image, a landscape, water, pollen in the air that looks beautiful when the camera zooms at it, et cetera; on the second page there is a space to write something down. Anne was using it to write her shopping lists there, or some of her thoughts she found interesting and much more. On one of them was a picture of flag of Quebec.

Then the ending of the dream started. We were driving back to her home in a silver car, she was the driver. Then we crashed, it was her ex-boyfriend. It turned out he did not want her back but informations from her about their daughter, he wanted to find her. Anne was unconscious for some time. He told me that Anne had on one of her cards some text written down which will lead him to his daughter, it was a blue card. He agreed to help with rescuing Anne if I will give him the card, so I gave him some blue cards. I do not remember why I needed his help.

Some time later Anne was resting in the bed in her house. It was weird because it seemed like nothing have happened, like she didn't had a daughter and the crash was just an accident. There were her two friends with her aswell. I was not sleeping the entire night, just sitting near desk in front of the bed, checking if everything is okay. The morning was beginning and all three of them were telling me to finally go to sleep, but I was sitting there awake anyway. Anne was asking if she can get up and maybe go on the walk to the town, we all said it is too early and she should rest for couple of days. The same, or maybe next day, I was sitting on the floor, leaning on the bed. Anne was feeling better and she started to push me with her foot, I was acting like I don't react and then I tickled her to stop doing it. We were joking and laughing, Anne did it to lighten up the mood 'cause we were worring about her. It can seem weird as I wrote it but I mean she was just messing with me out of boredom and seeing me being too serious.

I can not remember any voices, but sometimes when someone was speaking, I was seeing words in dream with ""coming on the screen"" efect. Those words were fully made up I believe and made of three letters usually; examples: ród, dón, etc.",2024-05-07 06:59:18
655,Dreams,Always ending up in a subway,"So I've had these dreams. I don't know if they would be considered as recurring dreams because they start in the same place but always end differently.

I start off in some some kind of massive subway station, and I mean massive. The walls and roof are gray there's people so it's not like a liminal space, but the main thing is getting to the subway cars and well where they go. Going down a massive stair case about six or twelve flights of stairs straight down, you reach the main platform where all the cars are. Their's the usual ones, but then there's the ones I go on most times, these small grey ones that have one seat and no windows. I usually have to cram myself inside this car, and then the door shuts, and I know it begins to move. Then I ended up with a few station which I'll put a list of them with names I've given them. The latest one I actually entered a different subway car this one had about eight seats still pretty small, but it was better than being in basically a small space I never get back on or in the small subways cars since they start moving again. So here's the list of subway stations I've ended up at. i don't know the meaning behind it all.

Subway station list

Abandoned bridge(first): I remember ending up on this massive wooden bridge no one else around. There are subway cars moving, but no one on them, and their in disrepair but still go to their stations on time. In the distance was a city.

Underwater: I never really got to see all of it, mainly the station itself. It had this blue tint to everything, so I'm guessing it was underwater.

Overgrown: Same as the underwater station never really explored. The station was overgrown with plant life and windows, which were broken with vines crawling through, but I could see a city through them.

Ally station: The station was in a bit of bad condition but looked average, just some graffiti and garbage. I actually left the station and ended up in an alleyway I'm guessing in the city I keep seeing.

The docks: So this one was odd as I don't remember getting out the subway car or station, but I do remember getting on. I ended up in this small town that faced the ocean and had a massive dock as a side walk.

???(latest and no idea what I would name it): So this one was the strangest first time I ever actually took a subway ride with anyone else. The car was big held about eight people but it was two of us. We got on and our journey began constant dark tunnels but the few times we were in a bright zone we would see stone soldiers seating in subway car seats out our window but there were a lot of them like the terracotta soldiers. After some more traveling and constantly feeling like we were on a rollercoaster we ended up I would say ""crashing"" we lander in a sand pit but more because there wasn't any more visible track with the car landed in the sand. We got out and realized we were basically stuck and needed to follow the tracks back out of this tunnel, and either A find an access tunnel or B find our way back to the main station. The climbing began, but well, I never got to know the outcome since I woke up.",2024-05-07 06:45:42
656,Dreams,Recurring dreams,"I keep having a dream about a house with white walls and a blurry television. That’s essentially the extent of it. 

I also keep dreaming of a friend who is no longer in my life. Admittedly, it was one of those “unrequited love” situations. I’m happily married now, and I no longer have those feelings for this former friend (I haven’t seen her in ten years). **** is up with this? I’m very annoyed. ",2024-05-07 06:40:31
657,Dreams,You know those dreams that you feel absolutely relieved to wake up from?,"I just had one of those. I had a dream that I decided to become a cam girl, I had all these **** toys with me and set myself up on what I thought was a website for camming, I get started and I’m doing my thing, butt ****, as vulnerable as I can be, only to look up and see that I’m actually on a teams call with 50 people from my company and all of them are on camera just watching me. The dream went on slightly too long and I can actually feel the heart dropping panic feeling still. My daughter woke me up by crying and I’ve never been so relieved to hear that cry in the middle of the night, it felt so real and I woke up with my heart racing. 

Interpretations welcome!

658,Dreams,Recurring Dreams About a Crush,"So I used to have dreams about this crush of mine and in my dreams it's like he never wants to talk to me like in the start of the dream when I would see him I was the one that was excited to see him and he was happy too but not excited.

659,Dreams,Reoccurring Pain in dreams,"Ive been having these reoccurring dreams, the scenario, place, people, etc is not always the same, but it always has be unable to breathe and in the most uncomfortable pain of all time. Its usually someone jabbing, elbowing, kneeling into my side or somewhere in my abdomen. I will constantly beg them to stop and sometimes they do and sometimes they dont. Its like, the weirdest feeling ever i cant really describe how it feels other than, an immense form of pain and discomfort, ive never felt that much pain irl. 

I often get sleep paralysis, and im wondering if maybe its a form of it somehow. I have lots of dreams where i feel different types of pain ( Stabbed, Burned, Shot, Etc. ) since i was very little, so its not entirely new to me, but its the most different out of all. Im considering telling my doctor at this point because it is very exhausting. Might be as simple as to not drink as much caffeine or whatever. I dont know, im just wondering if anyone else has had a similar occurrence, or if im alone in this feeling. ",2024-05-07 05:39:04

661,Dreams,Spirit / Entity wearing a veil was watching me sleep,"I'm typing this right after it happened. It’s currently 2:40 am, and I woke up about 5-6 minutes ago. I don’t have a close relationship with my mother or father, but I live with them. 

I dreamt about being down the street from my house, tornados forming right in front of me, one after the other, attacking me then vanishing. It was terrifying seeing a tornado form so quickly, then come at me, getting bigger and bigger. The only thing I could do was hold onto a street sign so it wouldn’t pick me up. The eerie screeching noise of the wind while in the tornado made the dream even more terrifying. 

When I made it home, my parents were there. My mom asked me, “Are you going to cut your hair?” (Currently, in real life, my hair is at its longest I’ve ever had it.) I replied, “Yeah, I probably will.” She then tried to cut my hair, but she gave me a bad haircut and scalped parts of my hair. Furious and upset, I grabbed a pickaxe and destroyed her iPhone and her favorite door (our front door). Then I ran inside my room, crying. My dad asked her what happened, and when my mom explained, I overheard my dad say, “That's why he doesn’t open up to you, because you don’t try to understand him. I don’t blame him for reacting this way.” Then my mom said, “He’s always violent.” My dad went inside our house, and that's when I came outside my room, shaking, emotional, and embarrassed. 

He then asked me, “What’s wrong, mijo?” I went up to him and hugged him as I cried, taking in one of those quick breaths while sobbing (they are called globus sensation). I took in one of those quick breaths as I caught myself waking up, almost like if I was sleep-talking but sobbing. As I woke up on my back, facing the top wall, I saw a woman staring down at me. My chest sunk out of fear. She was wearing a veil over her head like the **** Mary, but her face had a statue-like expression of disgust. I didn’t freeze up; I had a fight-or-flight moment and grabbed one of my pillows to hit her, but my pillow just ended up hitting the wall behind her. After that, her face faded out right in front of me (like a Polaroid picture developing) with the same expression of disgust. 

The picture I provided is what resembles the expression she had on her face.",2024-05-07 05:06:50
662,Dreams,Nightmare,"I just had a nightmare that I was at a hotel, having fun, then a man tried to **** me, I kicked and tried to get his hands off me, ran away, got into my hotel room, locked the door, then when I slightly woke up I saw like flashes of me when I was younger in front of me, like me in front of my eyes staring back at me, I was in that state where im concious and awake but cant move, so I shook myself awake scared (like shook my body to wake myself up more so I can move my body) and when doing this my hands looked like they were movinh in slow motion, then I looked around and saw like, patterns in shadows (despite being awake), like old timey patterns

I only slept like an hour and 40 minutes, note ive never been **** before so it isnt like, repressed past thoughts or **** like that

664,Dreams,Physically realistic sensation in a dream of someone hovering over me with a message?? Help decode please,"What does it mean if I’ve dreamt an experience of what felt like I was awake, and a silhouette of a girl hovered over me (I vividly saw the outline of her wavy hair dressed down, but didn’t actually see her, she was just a shadow that hovered over me while I laid in bed), said and called me “Hey, Regime.” (As in the word Regime), then proceeded to suddenly and aggressively swipe her hands forward from both sides of my neck, behind my ears, then towards my ears in one very quick swift motion I literally felt my earlobes shaking that it made me jump awake in shock. I literally felt it physically with such vivid sensation I could’ve sworn I was awake and had to blink to realize I wasn’t.
I looked over to my cat who was sleeping next to me and was grateful I at least had her to protect me if there was some kind of spiritual implication to what I had just experienced haha 😅 

After thought: if this in any way is helpful additional information, I’ve just realized that though my brain works primarily in English and that I’ve initially comprehended the word spoken by the girl as the English word “Regime”, I realized it could just as easily have been رجيم (Reh-jeem) in Arabic meaning “diet”. I also woke up seconds before I heard the early morning Fajr prayer here in the Middle East where I reside (Though I am not a practicing Muslim, so I don’t know how that could apply to me). Could this have any connection to what I’ve dreamt, and what does it mean? Does any one have any ideas?
Would love to hear any. Thanks!",2024-05-07 04:17:45
665,Dreams,We Are All Jellymen,"(I'd like to share my dream to see if we can explore crafting different dream endings together.)

I dreamt that I had two brothers, and we were all jellymen who could shape-shift as needed.

Besides being celebrities, my older brother was also a doctor, so we went to the hospital to visit him. Since he was busy, he directed us to a room to rest for a while.

He gave us some clay and jelly, saying that if someone entered our room and we needed to scare them off because we were dark jellymen, he instructed us to roll our eyes, then use the black clay to mimic a gun and point it at the intruder. That would scare them off.

My younger brother and I decided to take a nap. Upon waking up, we discussed what our mother had taught us about self-protection. As we talked, we picked up the clay and practiced shaping it into the form of guns.

While our older brother continued to be occupied, my younger brother and I went back to sleep. When I woke up fully rested, I noticed that the jelly in our transparent jars had turned transparent as well.

Seeing that there was less jelly in my brother's jar, I took a long drop of jelly from my own jar and added it to his.

Strangely, when I added the jelly to his jar, his jelly suddenly multiplied and overflowed from the jar. I couldn't help but wonder: could this jelly actually grow?

As it turns out, because we were celebrities, we had fans who were simultaneously following us. They saw how our mother taught us to protect ourselves and found it not okay. So, the fans crowdfunded and donated to help us. As the donations increased, the jelly in our jars also increased, becoming more and more abundant.

So, when I added a drop of jelly to my brother's jar just now, it coincided with someone donating to him, causing his jar to overflow with jelly.",2024-05-07 04:12:09
666,Dreams,Could someone interpret my wasp dream?,"I'd call it a nightmare but I'd also call it a dream since I would like someone to interpret it for me, but yeah.

Anyways, last night I had a really weird dream. And by weird, I mean *really* weird. 

I was my age that I am now (so 21), but I was in my bathtub covered with the towel my family used for me when I was a child and for some reason, my dad was bathing me? I was in the water with that towel on because I was covering myself from the wasp so as to not get bitten or for it to not land on me. All I remember is that I was panicking and screaming amd crying, as I always do because I am terrified of insects, but I also remember that the wasp was flying around the bathroom and above my dad, mostly in the corner between the wall and the ceiling, and my dad was mouthing something which I'm assuming is ""Calm down, I'll throw it out"" or something along the lines of that, I don't know because it felt like he was mouthing it silently. 

On the other hand, I couldn't move in the bathtub, so it felt like I was having a sleep paralysis, but I'm not sure if that's what it was. I wasn't able to move while I was in the bathtub, and it took about a minute for me to move in my bed and feel my legs and my body once I woke up. 

If anyone knows how to interpret this, could you help me find out what the dream was trying to say/was about?

Thank you in advance. 😊🙏🏻",2024-05-07 03:53:52

668,Dreams,sleep paralysis in a dream,"Sometimes i’ll be having a dream where i’ll be in a completely different bed or laying on a couch or where im doing whatever then transition to a bed, but not my own bed ever, it’s always different. but it’ll all be going good but it cut short where i randomly get sleep paralysis but in my dream. i don’t “wake up” my bed, i just randomly get it in wherever i am in my dream then after some struggling and usually a lot of noise i wake up. is this some sort of false sleep paralysis? or is it sleep paralysis but in a deeper stage of sleep.

669,Dreams,Why are my dreams suddenly useful?,"In a few weeks, going to be on campus to take a specific class that I'm enrolled in for the summer. I'm feeling both excited and nervous about it. In my dream, a lot of stuff went wrong, including the fact that I ended up being late for my class. This reminded me to make sure to remember to be on time when I am on campus to take the class.

This is a slightly funnier example, but I had a dream that showed me with a specific haircut that I was planning to get. I looked not-so-good, so when I woke up, I was able to decide that I won't get that one. In another dream, it showed me a different haircut that actually looked decent, and I'm currently planning on getting it

670,Dreams,I'M HAVING REALLY WEIRD DREAMS. ,"I've been dreaming of myself. Another me struggling in a mental hospital. These dreams are so vivid that I go back to them when I open my eyes. Like today, I was dreaming that I was in the same bed I am in right now. And I was tweaking. I felt like I was hallucinating. Yes, in the dream I was hallucinating that the curtains were shaking. I open my eyes, I'm just in my bed sleeping. Then I drift again and I start feeling my cigarettes on my bed where I put them. But I open my eyes and I'm trying to hold nothing. My hand is empty. These dreams make me feel very drowsy and very tired. I then sleep and dream that I am In a huge room with a big bed with a very big white head board. I then immediately go back to the mental institution with an empty room with only a bed and white beddings. And there, I see myself tweak out. The tweaking me runs towards me and I try run but decide to just wake up where I wake up with a massive headache. Idk, what do y'all think? What is happening to me? ",2024-05-07 03:04:26

Ive ""fought"" in many theaters, ive been in the thick mud of the somme, the black sands of Okinawa, the bloody sands of Omaha beach, the humid jungles of Vietnam, the mountains of Afghanistan in the 80's, the desert of iraq during desert storm, the hills of Chechnya, and the steppes of Ukraine. Im a 19 year old kid with the war stories of an 80 year old. The dreams are so vivid that ive woken up yelling and checking for holes and wounds that obviously aren't there. Idk man. Its not like i don't like them, weirdly enough ive started to like them, its definitely a good outlet to get my anger out. but its pretty annoying wanting to sleep only to be dropped into a combat zone.

672,Dreams,I keep dreaming of her but she ain’t real,"She is gorgeous, blonde hair brown eyes, her face was blurry at first and I couldn’t tell if I know her irl or not but then as I kept dreaming of her. her face became visible to me, exactly my taste, I didn’t even know she was til I dreamed of her. 


We never talk much, we just sit in places I do know and mostly she listens to me, but when she does respond it’s some kind of really good **** advice I didn’t hear from nobody before.


Last night she told me she’s dead, I didn’t ask anything for this answer to be said, she just kinda subconsciously knew i wanted to ask where do I know her from and what’s her deal.


She said she died a few years back and she was around my area, since I didn’t study in my hometown and most of my friends ain’t from here, makes me wonder if she actually was. 

I never knew anyone that would remind me of her either, not personality, not looks. And she always gives me goosebumps something my ex couldn’t even do. 



I just don’t know why she keeps coming to my dreams and who is she, the dreams are so realistic, and I wake up feeling hella lonely 💀

674,Dreams,Dream about a crow and the return of a 7 eyed deer. Would love help interpreting ,"I have very vivid dreams every night, but this one seemed very meaningful. 

In my dream I was living in a house/neighbourhood that I have never seen before. My partner and his friends left to drive around in a car and I laid down in the open front door so my lower body was in the house and my upper body was on the deck. 

As I laid there, a very old looking crow with foggy white eyes and lots of scars on its body perched on my arm. At first I thought “this is so cool”, and stayed with him for a while, but as the sun went down I tried to gently send him off but he wouldn’t move. He was not intimidating and all he did was rest on me, he just refused to fly away. I didn’t want to push him off as he seemed very fragile, but I was scared to invite him into my home. I had a weird feeling that he brought something evil, despite him not showing any signs of malice- so I was stuck in the position I was in. When I finally looked up from the stubborn crow there was a horned deer with 7 eyes staring at me and my open door. At this time I wasn’t entirely frightened, I just had the residual suspicion of the crow. But my partner returned and jumped out of the car, yelled at me to go inside, and then frantically told me something along the lines of “I would think you would be smart enough to go inside when the leader (the deer) is here”. I then woke up. 

The 7 eyed deer has been in my dreams before, and has recently been in them more frequently. But until this dream the deer has been neutral, and I saw him as being similar to a two headed snake…just a cool thing to walk the same earth as.

675,Dreams,I had this crazy dream and now this girl is stuck in my head ,"So last night I had this dream, basically what happened is: I was chilling in my house sleeping and then I woke up to some noise and I randomly went outside and got held at gunpoint by people pretending to be police officers. I somehow used a random girl I’ve never ever ever seen in my entire existence as bait to escape the police impersonators. After that I went to my homeschool co op I go to for some reason and then quickly walked into a hostage situation. A **** CULT, that’s right a GODDANG CULT was keeping my friends and peers hostage. I instantly saved this girl that goes to the homeschool co op. Now for context I think this girl is cute irl but I have a crush on someone different, But no I save this girl that I kinda like.

676,Dreams,Does this mean anything? Or have any symbolism?,"First dream was weeks ago, a big slim and long dark brown dog was chasing me in the parking lot, my heart was beating incredibly fast as I ran to my car. But I suddenly realized it was a dream and I could do anything. I slid across this car to get to mine, and panicked trying to unlock it with the key. I was just quick enough and got in on the passenger side and locked the doors, I mockingly teased the dog, but was still incredibly scared. It growled and walked around the car then ended up walking away, then I woke up, heart racing.

The 2nd dream was last night. I walked out of my apartment and went and sat in my car outside. I got in the passenger side and started a show. Across the street was a bear-sized black dog with a muzzle. It spooked me some, but I went back to my show keeping an eye on it. It slowly came to my side of the street just a few cars in front of me. My heart started racing, and I locked the doors. But it heard the sound of the car locking. It walked over, and I tried to hide under the window. The doors all of a sudden unlocked. I quickly locked them again, and it came around the car to the driver's side and stared into my soul. The doors unlocked again, and I quickly locked it. It began to growl so fiercely slobber was getting on the window. The doors unlocked again, and I told myself I need to leave now, and I woke up. But weirdly it almost seemed like I knew it somehow. ",2024-05-07 01:21:52
677,Dreams,I  keep having dreams where my jaw feels super tight and locked and is VERY PAINFUL,"So im 22f and I have been having these dreams for months now where a random scenario will be happening \[nothing relevant to my jaw/teeth\] then out of nowhere, one of few things will happen;

- my jaw begins to clench so hard that I feel my teeth nearly about to crack

- my jaw locks/is being forced towards one side, and the pain is very extreme in the joints 

- my mouth feels as though it is being forced open, but I cannot close it or move it without risking dislocating it 



All are extremely painful in my dream, but when I wake I up I never feel any tension in my jaw at all. I have seen a few people post about similar experiences however most describe themselves to be going through stressful times in their personal lives. I however don’t have anything going on at the moment and feel as though my life is fairly stable compared to what it used to be.

They dropped the new episode and I was so excited to watch it. I immediately opened it on my laptop but for some reason the first 20 minutes was just one of the voice actors discussing the ""Hazbin Hotel colour theory"" and talking about why his character has the colours he does.

The actual episode only lasted for about 7 minutes and the whole time was just one of the characters singing.

681,Dreams,The house of my deceased aunt ,"I had an aunt who was like a second mother to me. Her home felt like a second home. She passed away about 2.5 years ago. 

I haven’t been having recurring things happen in my dreams, but it seems like the majority of them are taking place in my aunt’s house. Just last night I had a dream that involved my coworker, and she and I were both college students in a dorm… but the dorm was my aunts house. 

For anyone that interprets dreams, do you know what this could mean? What does the house of a deceased loved one represent? Why do I keep ending up back in her house? It gives me comfort to think that maybe she and I are still spiritually connected somehow, and that I am subconsciously thinking of her in my dreams. ",2024-05-07 00:05:22

Now I’ve felt weird and sad all day. In the dream, I was with a group of people that included my (recently) ex father-in-law when a storm approached. Except that it wasn’t a storm, it was like…alien warfare? We watched as some sort of weapon detonated and then we saw the shockwaves (I guess?) come towards us. Two girls near me were just kind of like “well, there’s nothing we can do” and I turned to whoever it was next to me and kissed them? I wish I could identify them but alas. Anyway, felt like a weird reaction on my part but sure. Then the waves hit and I could *feel* it. It was like pressure but nothing? but also kind of warm and then my ears filled up and it went quiet and I woke up. But before I actually woke up I “woke up” in the dream I guess but definitely not in reality. And I don’t really know what to do with any of this and I hate it 😌",2024-05-07 00:04:37
683,Dreams,My dream of a full relationship ,"
Just fully lived a relationship, I have no clue who she is but her image is just stuck in my head.

I was meeting a guy that I hadn't seen in years and I was in his house, it was us, a friend of his and his girlfriend, my guy was being a **** and playing with his friend, so I just remembered leaving and his girlfriend left right after me and entered the elevator, we didn't talk that much just normal chatting.
After that I just found her on a hall of her college and we started talking and went for a coffee, she was talking to me about how that relationship that she was in just didn't make sense and she was ready to move on, after that I just remember that we were just constantly hanging out, going for groceries and getting things that her mother asked for while she was talking about her day, it was so fun, every time we were entering the elevator we would always try to see who would enter first and we were always laughing and having fun.
After a bit it just felt like she was part of my life and part of my routine.
And one last time we went into the elevator, no one was playing around or trying to reach the buttons first, and we knew something was about to happen, she started talking first, she was saying that she needed some time because she was about to take on a giant project and that we wouldn't be able to see each other as often, right after she finished talking, I answered we the news that I was just told that I got a job in another country (wich is the only true thing in this story, been abroad for about 6 months)
We both knew that it went from a ""we will have less time for each other"" to a full goodbye and just hugged until the elevator reached the right floor while tears were slowly running down our faces.

She was a beautiful woman, not a perfect woman like the ones you see on tv, no, she was a beautiful woman still with her imperfections and that just made it feel more real.

686,Dreams,i keep having dreams with the same underlying issues/emotions,"just posting to see if anyone had any interpretations of these dreams. 

ever since i was a kid, i’ve had weird dreams often that have the same kind of vibe. i’m somewhere (either a big mall, or a school, or something like that) where i don’t know how to get out, and all the exits are extremely confusing and unsafe. for example, there will be a huge spiral staircase with no railings and missing steps, or a rope that i have to swing across over an abyss, or floating rocks i have to jump across, or weird tiny holes and tunnels i have to crawl through that i fear i might get stuck in, etc. 

i just had one where i had to go on this weird escalator that was wavy (like one side would go high up into the air and then the other side would and u had to hold on) and had no railings so you were just being thrown around and at the top there was a hole you had to climb through (literally going UPWARDS) but i ended up doing it and i spotted my car and then my dream ended. i was also with my friend and she was telling me to go go go or else she would fall off and i felt the urge to keep going even though i was afraid, because i didn’t want her to get hurt. some dreams i have a buddy but i’m mostly alone in this. something else that always happens is that i have an objective, find the exit or find my car and then the dream will end signifying that i reached the goal. 

BUT, there are other people in my dream doing these things like nothing, not even thinking twice. they feel like video game NPCs, like as if they’re not real at all and i know they’re not real, like robots. like, it’s normal for them, they easily do these things and think nothing of it, meanwhile i’m here terrified and looking for other ways to get out because i’m terrified. i always find myself convincing myself in my dream, “everyone else can do it, these people probably do this every day or multiple times a day, so it can’t be that bad” but then i always think “i don’t want to be a follower, what if these people aren’t like me and i won’t be able to do it?” 

these dreams always scare me but as i grow older i’m able to conquer them or find a clever way to exit safely, but as a kid, i’d panic and the dream would end from my panic or from me taking too long to get out so i’d run out of dream time. very weird. i wanted to hear if anyone had any interpretations of this!!",2024-05-06 22:32:23

688,Dreams,When being ritualistic turns into a nightmare.,"Hello,

I often get asked to share this dream experience as much as possible. 

Over the course of one particular night I had a series of dreams stacked on top of each other. So, I would wake from one dream, and land into another. I tend to have extreme-consciousness inside of dreams, enough to talk, remember, and know im still dreaming.

This style of dreaming however was something I could never imagine. 

I had just left a theme-park dream, being on a rollercoaster, and I had awoken, inside of my room, as I have always, my entire life - It was the start of a normal day it seemed. I checked my phone, saw some notifications from my parents; lately we've been doing this conference thing, every morning and evening, in regards to a really big financial investment my parents were making and I know the lingo, easy. I put some rice on the cooker for breakfast, and then I call them up after via facetime and get the conference going. 

I'm eyeballing the time because of the rice on the cooker, and even with small-talk, these conferences really don't last beyond half an hour.

At the end of the conference.  I wake up. I'm back in my room, I had forgotten nothing, it was literally, just a moment ago. I check my phone, same text message, same missed facetime.

I call my parents again immediately, and instead of mentioning what just happened, I proceeded to speak with them, but using what I had just learned from them in the dream. They never found anything strange, or called me out for what I was saying - and this is an anomaly, because we're talking about finances here, my parents handle money so differently than me. very, very differently, they would call me out for saying gibberish or non-sense. 

I still haven't told them about this.

  
Thanks for reading.

689,Dreams,Ever had someone who's extremely vivid appear in your dreams?,"I had a dream last night that I've been thinking about literally all day. It centered around this attractive young man (whose name was Damian, I think) and our passionate, emotionally supportive relationship that was frowned upon by several other dream characters (primarily old people, so I didn't think much of it). He was some sort of athlete, and had gained fame and recognition for it. If I had thought of this while conscious, I would consider it extraordinarily self-indulgent fan fiction.

For reference, I'm a 20 year old bi guy, but I've never dated or been intimate with another dude. But when I woke up, I was so disappointed that Damian wasn't a real person in my life. I've never felt this way about a dream, to the point where now I'm hopeful that I'll run into this guy in real life, or see him again in my dreamscape. He just felt so... real, I guess is the best way to put it.

691,Dreams,Nightmare meaning? ,"So this might be a little long, but bear with me. I had the most terrifying nightmare of my life a few years ago and I remember it so clearly. I am posting this because I just watched a TikTok of someone who saw almost the exact same figure. 

I dreamt that I was in the old townhome that I grew up in and sleeping in my old bedroom. When I woke up (in my dream) I was confused as to how I got in my old townhome. The place looked identical to when I lived there, but there was absolutely no furniture in the entire place and all of the ceiling lights were a deep red color. My bedroom (the room I was in) was pitch black and all I could see was the dark red light shining through the crack in the door. I walked over to the door and opened it up. From my door there is a set of steps leading down the main door of the house. I noticed it was completely wide open. Then almost like a fuzzy cloud, a person oddly came into focus at the bottom of the steps. I got angry and started to yell at them to get out of my house. This entire time I am completely lucid. This is the only lucid dream I’ve ever had. I started to walk down the steps and I noticed this person was probably a 20ish year-old male and he was completely out of it. He was almost like half physically there and not at all mentally. It was almost as if I was seeing like a projection of him. Very odd. But he was mumbling under his breath and sort of spazzing a little bit. I continued to yell at him and try to force him out the front door but I could not move or touch him. So I walked over to the front door and noticed it was pitch black and foggy out, and there is a parking lot with a bright street light on (which is accurate to how it was in real life). But there was nothing in the background. Just black and empty. So I shut the door and turned around, and the man was gone. Now I’m in the living room. There is still no furniture in the house at all. I notice there is a white mask hanging in the corner of the room by a thick rope. The mask has long black hair hanging down the floor. Probably about 4 or 5 feet long. It looked as if it was a real person but with no body. I sat there and stared at it for what felt like 30 mins. So this freaked me out even more than I already was and I turned around and went back upstairs. But when I got to the top of the stairs I noticed something was different. One of the other bedroom doors was open and had normal lights. This was my parent’s bedroom and it was fully furnished. When I walked to the doorway I noticed there was a women sitting on the bed facing the other way. All of a sudden I was frozen and could not move. This part felt like hours. After what felt like an hour she slowly stood up and started walking around the bed. Then she turned and I saw her face. She was about 6’ tall and eye level with me, long black hair, semi-tan skin, what looked like a white cross/war paint on her face, razor sharp teeth with an unnaturally large grin, and blood all over her mouth and bottom half of her face. She slowly walked towards me for what felt like again… hours. Then she eventually got so close our noses were almost touching and she stood there grinning at me and that felt like again hours… then eventually I snapped and woke up. 

I should also mention I have only seen one thing in that townhome before that I cannot explain. It was a long black haired woman with wet hair sitting at my dining table facing away from me. Never really experienced anything since that or anywhere else. So it’s odd that I had a dream about that townhome years after I moved out and saw such a similar figure to the one I saw in real life (while I still lived in the townhome).

Not sure what this means, but the TikToker told a story that described the exact same figure with all of the same details. In her story the figure also grinned at her for hours…I am wondering if this is something others have experienced?

692,Dreams,Got shot at point blank ,"Had the weirdest dream that has left me feeling confused and tired? I dreamt I was sitting in the back of a cop car, because I was delivering food to a wanted criminal, so the cops wanted me to tag along. One of them was super nice to me, and the other kept being saying that once the chase was over, he wanted to see my license and registration (because i’m apparently a delivery guy). And then out of nowhere, the nice cop shot me point blank. Right between my eyes. 

I felt no pain, but I felt the wetness of the blood running down my face and thinking, how long will my soul be lingering until it’ll have a new body to enter. And just feeling so alone in death. I thought why death was taking so long, and remember reaching out for the cop’s handing and forgiving him? or asking why he did that? 

Any insight into what all of this could mean? Doesn’t seem like the plot of anything I’ve watched or read recently. Woke up right after I reached out to hold the cop’s hand. ",2024-05-06 20:36:57

Any help/advice?",2024-05-06 20:27:09
694,Dreams,Vivid Dreams,"Lately, I've been having very vivid and sometimes even graphic dreams. For 2 weeks, my dreams felt way realer than they used to. I'm confusing my memories with my dreams, which is really stressful and somehow frightening. What is interesting, is that my dream self also recognizes that something is wrong, I found myself (not lucid tho) taking pictures of things that don't feel right to me or talking with people about how things work and trying to make sense of it. If I was lucid dreaming things wouldn't be that bad because I would know it's a dream, instead my dream self struggles to understand what's happening and when I'm awake my memories melt together. The dream can be just like real life talking with my friends or texting and then out of nowhere someone walks through a wall. 

Is there a casue of why its happening to me?",2024-05-06 19:23:40

697,Dreams,Dreams you remember years later..,"What are some dreams you remember from being a kid?  Good or bad.

1.  Bad, I had a dream my older brother got crushed in a big ball of garbage.  This was back in the 70's.  Everytime I hear the song blinded by the light it reminds me of the dream. 

2.  Good, my family was moving to a new state, I was 11,  before we moved I had a dream that I was throwing a tennis ball against a wall and this girl in a tube top came up to talk to me.   After we moved,  I kept an eye out for a girl in a tube top.  

I am sure there are others,  but those are the two I remember of the top of my head.   Both were over 40 years ago. ",2024-05-06 18:12:40
698,Dreams,Tormenting dreams of finding love,"I am single and have been completely content with that for a long time, but for the past 6 months or so I have this dream about every other night where I immediately connect with someone, and I feel this intense love feeling between us, and seem to bond with the person in the dreams. It feels wonderful in the dreams and I feel completely at peace in them, but then when I wake up I slowly realize it was just a dream and none of it really happened, the person I imagined and their actions weren’t real; this puts me into anguish for usually the first half of that day. Then slowly as I go through the day it means less and less to me, until I eventually shrug it off because I don’t feel those emotions anymore, and then I have the dream again a couple days later and the cycle continues.

It’s usually centered around this one person in my life that I’m attracted to, but its been other random people or people I’ve never met as well.

701,Dreams,Dream diary day 3: Not the best birthday party,"TW: Graphic mentions involving death

I was celebrating my birthday in big building I can only describe as a mall/swimming pool hybrid. The lighting was very pale and cold, sort of Black Mirror vibes.
At some point my friend Megan walked out, all upset. I followed her outside to ask her what was wrong, but I couldn't find her anywhere, so I called her on the phone.
She was crying and sounded so upset and angry, but I couldn't make out anything she was saying, it was basically just very upset sounding word salad.

As I was walking outside and talking on the phone, I could see through a big window of the mall/pool and I saw my other friend, Lexi, falling down several stairs. It was such a nasty fall and I immediatly knew this couldn't end well, so I rushed back to the entrance, wanting to go see Lexi as soon as possible.

Megan noticed my responses were a bit more distracted at this point, and she got even more upset, crying harder. ""See? You don't even care. You don't give a **** about how I feel.""
This made the dream so panicky, because I was trying to be a supportive, caring friend for Megan, talking to her on the phone, but I was also worried about Lexi, needing to see her as quickly as possible, and I was also suddenly very confused about finding my way back through the hallways of the mall/pool, tons of people standing in my way. It all felt very rushed and scary.

Then, I finally entered this very gloomy looking pool area. Flickering fluorescent lighting, people in swimwear sitting on the floor, crying. Candles on the ground.
I was still talking to Megan on the phone, and as I turned around the corner, I heard Megan say, in a very quiet, shocked voice: ""Omg, MagicalBae... I just got a message that Lexi died.""
Right as she said that, I saw &gt;! Lexi's incredibly mangled corpse on the floor of the pool area and I understood the reason why all those people were crying. !&lt;

That jolted me right awake.
Fiancé later told me I was making such upset sounding noises in my sleep that he even considered just waking me up.",2024-05-06 17:26:28
702,Dreams,A nightmare that I almost found.. enjoyable?,"Not sure if ""enjoyable"" is really what I'd use to describe it. It's more like I liked the dream because I'm curious what its like?? Idk. I had a dream where I was chased down and shot multiple times. I keep thinking about it because I had mixed feelings about it. Ofc, it was scary while I was experiencing the dream, but afterwards, I wanted to experience it again. Like, maybe its the adrenaline chase?? I have no idea. I just feel like that's something I *shouldn't* want to dream about.

Just remembered another detail that is consistent throughout all of my dreams where I get injured. I always see stories where people who get hurt in their dreams immediately wake up (cause of shock or somethin), but for me I don't wake up right away. I usually end up realizing its a dream and start lucid dreaming, or sit around waiting for an ambulance until I actually wake up. Alright, this is my second post here today, so I'm going to go back to just lurking lol.",2024-05-06 17:10:56

704,Dreams,I had a dream about a YouTuber and I don’t know what to think.,"
Before I tell the dream I want to say that I have mild autism; a few one or two big; you’re an adult; things I can’t do myself and this person to the YouTube channel; their **** structure; how they look; looks similar to me. Almost as if they are what I would be without my autism. Ok. Cool. Don’t know what to think of that.

In the dream we were in a grassy field with trees surrounding like a photograph you’d see on google. Flower field this. Flower field that. Anyway, we were in the grassy field with trees surrounding. They come up to me and say; ask, “Can I hug you from behind?” They then hug me from behind with their head on one of my shoulders and I slowly put my arms; hands on theirs. In real life that **** isn’t easy for me and I guess in the dream I can fully a bit more.

Then next thing I know it; I’m on their lap under a tree; whatever kind of cuddle that usually is and they are saying, “shhh it is ok. A sensory attack of uncomfortableness at random whether something happens or not is normal. Here, take your glasses off here; mine too and how’s about we just sit here and take a nap.”

The end.

Why I dreamt of them is beyond me as clearly I don’t know them. But it did feel perfect for me for some reason.

Not going to say who the person; which YouTube channel it is in the dream.",2024-05-06 16:50:53
705,Dreams,Horrible reoccuring nightmare,"Ever since I was like 6, (I’m 14 now) I’ve had this horrible nightmare every once in a while. It always starts with me in usually a giant room, I mean giant, the walls are painted light blue with fake clouds attached to the walls. The room is filled with beautiful strong happy colors, sunflowers and roses, the flowers usually have faces. They dance and smile and everything is like in a cartoony style, like drawn kind of style. It’s just filled with happiness, and I too is happy. The room varies from dream to dream but it is always like that. Then it happens, I get teleported somewhere, and I have done something wrong. Something so horribly wrong, I get every bad feeling in the world. I’m going to try to explain it. Everything is horrible, I ruined everything. I’m going to **** die. Everyone is dead. It’s going to crush me, it’s not working, whatever I’m trying to do is not working. Everything is horrible. Every bad feeling in the world. It just happens so fast, I get teleported somewhere. The bad thing, that’s bad in every dream, it’s a thing that just doesen’t fit or is missing. One of those nightmares it was like a giant pole, a spinning black and white pole. There was a part of it, that had a different pattern of white and black. I don’t know why but it was horrible, something just ruined everything. Just the thing that it didn’t fit just, everything was bad and horrible and it felt like everyone was dead. I have never experienced anything horrible in my life, yet. I don’t understand what might be causing this nightmare. It is very weird. It’s so creepy how it is always so wonderful and happy, and suddenly the worst possible things that can ever happen happens all at once and it hurts so bad. My dad told me it might be a horrible experience an old grandfather had that transferred deep in my mind through genetics to me giving me these nightmares, but is that really possible?",2024-05-06 16:48:40
706,Dreams,Dream of giving birth and raising a baby girl meaning?,"I(19f) usually have very vivid dreams but I can tell the difference from reality and my dreaming. This morning was different. I laid down to take my nap and had a very real feeling dream of giving birth to a baby girl and naming her Lauren. She was so strong and I felt like our bond was so close even though I just had her. We struggled a lot since I left her dad and had to raise her as a single mother but no matter how hard it felt to raise her I was so happy to have her and lay her on my chest and do her hair all the time. I just remember myself being so stressed and then looking into my baby girls eyes and falling in love/ a great feeling of calmness seeing how she smiled back at me. In my dream I raised her until she was 5 years old before I woke up and when I did I could not stop crying because it wasn’t real but I wanted it to be so bad. Does anybody experience the same or know if those dreams have any meaning??

707,Dreams,Run away dream,"So I often have dreams where I'm at my house (either of the multiple residences I've had in my lifetime), I'm alone, and I just feel an overwhelming dread, telling me to run away as fast as possible, as far as possible.

Sometimes there's some kind of creature following me (it's like a ""common character"" kind of creature, in some dreams I **** them in droves, in others they chase me :D ), other times there's nothing chasing me, but I just KNOW I have to get away.

Anybody ever have a dream like this?

Also, this is entirely different to dreams where I just run around because I want to, I have those dreams as well, but in those cases I don't feel compelled (and I don't feel a deep dread), and I run because I want to (and in most of these dreams I can jump very high for some reason).",2024-05-06 16:43:05
708,Dreams,Keep having dreams of my best friend that I haven't seen in years,"Hey everyone, I have a few questions about my dreams. One of them is about my best friend that I haven't seen in years because we had a fallouting. But I still keep having dreams of her. The dreams used been her wishing I never existed or just her missing me so much. Those dreams used be frequent but now they're slow but still common but less of her being mean and more of her missing me and becoming friends again.

Sorry if this doesn't make any sense just trying as much as I can but still try to make it bite size without rambling. I can give more context of our past if it helps. Please know what this means and thank you all for your guy's time I really appreciate it.

Edit with more context: So me and my friend met in High school. It was my Freshman year. We became close friends and I slowly started to develop a crush on her because she help me grow as a person and she all around amazing. So in my Junior year and a bit of my Senior year we dated. But February of 2020 we broke up (Probably because I was afraid of losing her and didn't seem emotionally stable: She didn't tell me this I'm just guessing) felt like my whole world was falling apart (I ran away from her when she was trying to help I was scared and didn't know where to go. She got scared of me running away.) Fell into a depression and kept taking breaks on contact. Had a bad day training at my new job. So I thought I could call her because her voiced always calmed me down but she didn't wanted to call and just wanted to text. I asked her if she missed hanging out and replied with ""That's a complicated question"" it came off as she didn't want to be friends anymore. I insulated her and her brother (I have apologized to her brother.) But that was the end of our conversation. I do regret my actions and know I'm in the wrong. I do miss her but can now look at all the memories better except those two bad memories. I hope this context helps and sorry if it seems to rambly.",2024-05-06 16:38:08

710,Dreams,Weird dream,"So for some reason when I take naps I get very weird dreams/nightmares that I don’t get in just gonna try to explain it the best I can…
So I fell asleep and I felt like a woke up but my senses were all off. My hearing was dulled it felt like my ears were filled with water and I couldn’t hear. My eyes looked extremely blurry and crossed eyed like they werent open. And I couldn’t move my body I struggled so hard and nothing was working. I could only hear one voice talking but it sounds like a million voices all at once. Then nothing I woke up. 
I knew from before I have to stay up for a second to prevent from getting “paralyzed” again so I did and then fell back asleep. 
Of course I had like the weirdest combination of dreams after that. But the thing that confuses me the most is that I saw myself. I was sitting on the couch with my boyfriend and I was holding a babygirl (few months old) and I knew I was looking at myself and I believe the dream me also knew I was looking at her. I do not have any children yet (22) and neither have I ever had a miscarriage or pregnancy. But I continue to have dreams about this same baby girl very often. It just freaks me out that all of my dreams are in “POV” and I’ve never seen myself just sitting there like that. Is that even possible to see yourself like that? I only ever hear of people seeing their sleeping bodies but I was just like any other character in a dream. (Sorry for the long story)",2024-05-06 15:56:08
711,Dreams,Strange dreaming experiences ,"Hiya! 
Recently I've been having kind off lucid dreams. I can't completely control them, or set the scene, but I am aware of what happens, feel it, and think about 'new' actions to perform. 

First of all, I'm mentally stable, not stressed as far as I know, no depression, no recent 'traumarizing' experiences or anything. 

Last night, I dreamt about that I met someone, idk who, or why, and we just had a chat. Suddenly, my dad joins (somehow?) and makes the person I was meeting angry, by 'protecting' me from said person, as he thought she was bad. I realised that person got angry, and thought, consciously, 'maybe she has knives, get out of here'. That moment, she threw 2 throwing knives at me, followed by another 2, first around my stomach, then my throat. 
That moment, I woke up. Feeling strange after any dream I remember, I was genuinely scared to reach for my stomach, scared of feeling knives. 

Some nights ago, I had a similar dream as well. The strange thing is, my dad's not like that, I don't have any experiences with knive attacks, or recognise the 'killer'. 

I'm just wondering, if this would 'mean' something, or if there's any way I might be able to 'control' it more? ",2024-05-06 15:51:07
712,Dreams,Alternate Universe Dream,"In my dream, I was meeting up with a girl that I know from elementary school but literally haven't talked to in 15 years and never thought about her. She was going to stay with me while she is in town. I was going back to my apartment complex and she was meeting me outside the building. The apartment complex from the outside looks the same as the one im living in irl, but once I entered it was not the same. There was a tiny dunkin donut shop and so we went to grab coffee before heading to my apartment. For some reason, I was being rude to the cashier (not like super rude, but like I'm v soft spoken irl). We grabbed the coffee and went into the elevator, and once we exited the elevator, the whole layout of the floor is different. There was an elderly woman (creepy) who was entering the apartment next to mine and she has two dogs. I love dogs so I wanted to say to one which was white and fluffy but it ran away. So I was just going to head to my apartment w the friend but the old woman stopped me and asked if I wanted to pet her other dog. She then showed me the other dog and it was a brown **** dog (like Chinese crested dog). I noticed my apartment door is weird but still entered and everything inside is messed up (like someone rummaged through it). I then told the friend to stay in the unit while I go down to the front desk to see what is up. I didn't want to go into the elevator and took the stairs instead, but it lead me down to this creepy parking lot and I ran outside. This time, I am no longer outside my apartment complex but rather in a big city. 

I think the dream stopped there and I woke up but I never had a creepy dream like this before and the fact that I still remember it. I also randomly searched up the girl and she is in the same city as me! I didn't know this and our elementary school is like 8 hours drive away. (norcal vs socal). She just never crossed my mind and I literally forgot her existence. What does this mean? ",2024-05-06 15:23:37

714,Dreams,Dreaming about falling,"Hi. 
I had the weirdest dream last night, and I’m still thinking about it 24h later. I remember very little detail, the feeling and how it felt when i woke up. 

So basically I had just returned to work after a work injury. It was quite small, but seemed like a small fracture to the wrist and some bruises and cuts. My coworker talked to me and said that “I’d soon be able to use it like normal again”, and I still remember how my hand looked in that moment. It’s almost as if I can see the small bruises and wounds when I look at my hand irl. 

My workplace had changed drastically from my real life workplace, but the job was the same. I work in a warehouse, but in this dream it was in a huge, unfinished skyscraper. (Imagine a build site with scaffolding). We were 100 meters up in the air, and I had to walk out onto the scaffolding. It was a crappy scaffolding, basically made of a couple of planks and some steel. (I think I got it from The Last of Us 2, where Abby and Lev cross this “bridge”). As I’m standing there, I can hear something crack - and as I look towards my coworkers and try to run for my life, everything falls apart and I fall. 

Nothing to hold onto, nothing to grab. I’m just falling, screaming and eventually realizing that there’s nothing I can do and I stop screaming.  I fall for what feels like hours, and right as I’m about to hit the ground, I wake up. I feel really warm and my heart is racing, everything felt so f-ing real.  Woke up at 2:30 am (ish) and felt so scared that I had to watch some TikTok to think of something else lol. 

I don’t really know what I wanted with this post, I guess I just had to write it down somewhere. ",2024-05-06 14:49:06

717,Dreams,Dreaming about cheating on my boyfriend.,"I (21F) have been with my boyfriend (23M) for almost 3 years now. We have been in pretty great relationship very little conflict (aside from minor things like washing the dog, taking the trash, doing the laundry, but hardly any real stressors to our relationship) I feel very secure in my relationship. 

About a month ago I had a dream I was cheating on my boyfriend. I woke up kind of startled by it never had a dream like that before. I didn’t think much of it. (I’ve never cheated on my boyfriend or any prior partner either) As time went on I started having more dreams about intimate settings with other people. It hasn’t been the same person. Some of them are people I went to highschool with and some of them are people I have never even met. It’s been really weird to me.

Last night was the last straw for me. I had a recurring dream same person I went to highschool with him. I haven’t heard from him or spoken with him since my freshman year. In my dream he looked like himself as a freshman. I had just gotten married to my boyfriend in the dream and I left to go to the bathroom to freshen up before the reception. I walk into the bathroom and let’s call him Daniel. Daniel comes up to me saying I look very beautiful in my dress. I tell him thank you and that he shouldn’t be in the woman’s bathroom. I tell him this while looking through the mirror at him not actually to his face. He tells me to turn around and face him. I roll my eyes and do so. He then grabs me by my wrists and tells me that I’m making a mistake. He asks me if I still love him. I just gaze at him. He keeps getting closer to me asking me questions about if I truly love my boyfriend, and if I truly loved Daniel. I answered yes to both. He asked me why would I give up on us (Daniel and I) if I truly loved him. I didn’t know what to say I just stared before he ended up kissing me, and I kissed back. 

I woke up shortly after that heart pounding and sweating. Backstory on Daniel if it matters. I was head over heels “in love” with him since the 6th grade. Now I put into quotes “in love” because he knew I had the biggest crush on him, yet he dated all of my “friends”. Found any way to poke fun at me, and was just an overall complete ****. Around freshman year was when I kicked myself in the **** about being so love struck by him and killed that. I never thought about him again.

With all of these dreams I’d say I’ve had maybe a total of 8 or 9 3 of which being Daniel the other 5 being people I don’t even know. I’m just weirded out deeply by all of this. It freaks me out so much that I withdraw kind of from my real intimacy with my boyfriend. Again I want to emphasize I’ve never cheated on my boyfriend or any partners prior. I’ve also never considered cheating or found anyone else during my time dating my boyfriend even at the slightest bit more appealing than my boyfriend.


I guess my overall question is. Has this happened to anyone else. If yes how did you get out of this cycle of dreams about anyone other than your partner. 

PS. call me crazy but I did a deep dive on succubus but I feel like that could be a thing I don’t know what are your thoughts

 Dreaming While Half awake

March 15 2023

I’ve been having pretty crazy dreams lately some being so realistic then others, but for the most and I’d forget bits and pieces of my dream when I awoke so today is the first day I decided to write it all down 
                                    Time stamp: 4:38am 

On the Grayhound with a long ride back to Nashville Tn, I had my most eye opening dream. It felt so real when I opened my eyes I could feel the storm that was brewing when I slept.  Just had a layover in Louisville Kentucky and when headed out a storm was coming lightening stricking, heavy downpour and slick roads a little scary for a 18 year old to be riding by herself back home so I decided to fall asleep we had 4 more hours til we reached home it was 2:57am when we pulled off and would reach Nashville by 5:30. While I turned around in my seat that I had alone I was small enough to curl into a ball and sleep on the seat comfortably, not scared of a bus full of strangers but wasn’t ready for the dream I was about to have. Falling into a deeper sleep with rain drops and thunder singing a melody in my ear and after 5 mins I was in Dreamworld or as I call it A prison for the imagination.


“Sirens , police and News broadcasters” Warning I repeat this is not a drill seek shelter now the storm is coming the storm is coming!!! Warn your neighbors, lock your doors and read your bibles for this is nothing like what you’ve seen before!!!
I’m walking down the road warning people you have to go and hide, the storm is coming and it’s bad hearing thundering in the background. I’m running to every person I saw on the street. Sky’s getting dark and before I knew it the calm beautiful day it was turn grey and glumly and night set fast. While getting back to my house I started to notice something strange big holes in the ground like meteors had fell down to earth and hit ten feet apart in every direction I decided to look off down into one and was appalled by what I saw. (Lighting striked) I jumped before I could even fully process what I saw in the holes on the ground.

I run into the house lock-ing all doors and windows, getting my neices and nephews on the couch calm before the storm rolled in. I run to the front door and look out the blinds and see the storm getting closer my sister turns on the news the broadcaster repeatedly saying this isn’t a drill , hold on to your loved one and take out your bibles. I’m still looking out the window and see two people walking there dogs and so i opened it to warn them. “Get inside the storm is coming it’s not safe!” After my last words all the power in the house goes out. The storm was here. All I can remember is the news broadcaster saying this is like nothing we’ve ever seen before ancient animals from the prehistoric time was coming and they were angry. Remembering what I saw in the holes it was horns and half covered of body’s of rhinos and Dinos way bigger then the ones at the zoo, and they were standing as if stuck in place or a statue. I lock the door and turn to head to the couch when I see a homeless person run to the front door demanding that I let him in.

I can’t let you in I’m sorry!? Please seek shelter elsewhere. In my head I didn’t know this man from a hole in the wall and we had 3 little baby’s to calm before this storm arose. He’s banging on the door please please I need you and for 5 seconds it felt like the earth stood still not a sound to be heard the calm….
And before I could look out the door for the man he was gone the house started to shake as if a 10.4 earthquake would hit earth. I ran to the couch holding on to my nephews while my sister is holding on to her 7month old daughter we are scared shaking the house felt like it was getting picked up in a tornado and spun around. I could hear the rain hitting windows so hard it shattered from lighting. I held on to the boys as tight as I could praying this would be over soon, the house rocking back and forth and hearing dishes break and shatter I could feel me heart racing. My sister tried to grab on to us but in the mist lost grip of the baby and in a second the storm carried her away. We couldn’t believe our eyes the screams and tears we let out fighting to save my niece but also in fear. the house was off it’s foundation currently being spun in the air like a tornado and every raindrop sounded like a knock from the devil himself. Wiping tears and holding on tighter to the boys I saw a figure go past the window. It was the rhinos and dinosaurs from the ground they had arose and was angry damaging everything that got into their way. I looked at my sister while her husband is wiping the tears and devastation off her face knowing she may not see her daughter again I started to pray and tears filled my face. I just wanted protecting from this storm and before I could finish my prayer the bus hit a bump and thunder rumbled loud startling me awake. ",2024-05-06 13:47:49

I can’t remember the dream exactly (anything that happened before or after) but I remember being at a random clothing shop with my mom (54)  and my sister (27) and there was a man kind of lurking and just walking around the shelves as we looked at the clothes. The next thing I remember is him **** us on at a time and leaving us there. It was really off putting and scary dream and I don’t know at all what to think about it.

721,Dreams,"I have dreams of dying that terrify me, but irl I have been depressed and indifferent to it","The dreams are usually seeing the whole world crash and burn around me but instead of me accepting it like I am irl I am terrified and always run for my life. I’m a 21M college student who everything has gone wrong except my family life (failing classes as a former gifted kid, no friends, seeing others from my class graduating a year early, etc.), and for the past semester or two I’ve been dealing with so many terrible thoughts that it wonders me why I am so terrified of these specific kinds of dreams/nightmares. Is it something akin to my inner self truly not wanting to die or could it be my mind just preparing me for my eventual demise or something else?

722,Dreams,Got revenge against an old bully in an almost horror movie fashion.,"He was beating up a couple of my old friends from middle school. They were cowering in the corner of the room under a big coat.

I stood up and I'm not my little boy self from all those years ago. I'm my adult self. The bully swung a baseball bat at me. I grabbed the bat, yanked it out of his scrawny lil hands, and tossed it in the garbage.

He ran from me and I calmly followed him from one side of that school to the other.

He closed a door and locked it? I break it with a sledgehammer. He throws a baseball at me? I catch it and throw it into his big toe. He hides in the principal's office? I cut the desk in two with an ax.

He ran outside the school and thought he was safe. I kinda teleported behind him, pulled out my pocketknife, lightly cut his cheek with a little flick of my wrist, and disappeared again. I was a monster lol.

He freaked out and ran screaming into the woods while I'm standing there laughing and yelling ""Yeah! RUN ya little ****! Don't mess with my friends! RUN! HAHAHA!""

I ran back to my friends, hugged them, shook their hands, said goodbye, and woke up.",2024-05-06 13:19:51

724,Dreams,A house full of friendly zombies,"I had this dream when I was a kid every time I went to bed for about a month.

So I start in front of a rickety old house with a dense fog around the whole area. I can't see any other houses just an iron fence around the yard. I get closer to the entrance and step inside, when I get in it's just as rickety as it was on the outside just with old tattered furniture. 

So I round a few corners and I'm suddenly greeted by a group of about 15 zombies with glowing yellow eyes. I didn't scream though, and they didn't attack me. What they did was invite me to tea. So i sit with these zombies and have lengthy conversations and on recurring nights the zombies would be doing other various leisure activities which I would always catch them in the middle of.

They weren't Walking Dead zombies though, they spoke. 
I had full on conversations with all of them. Until one day the dreams just stopped, and it made little me sad that I couldn't see the zombies anymore. Is there any symbolism behind this?

(Obviously there's more details but I'm 22yo and can't remember the specifics now)",2024-05-06 12:54:48
725,Dreams,Dream Highlights ,"I had a dream that I didn't write down, but ended up returning to.

In the first dream, I was at my old elementary school. I was wearing dirty victorian underwear, with stains, dirt/mud. I knew that they were dirt stains, for some reason. I was wearing a band tee. I don't think I was given it, I gave it back. I had went into the school and saw my partner's friend, who looked amused. I gave him the shirt, which would've left me topless. I can't remember the dream well, maybe I woke up. Yes, I did. I did return to the room I was in. I took off by myself, venturing down the hall. My dad and brother later showed up, going into the room again.

My brother was being creepy and following me. I think I saw potato salad at one point in this dream. A pole/lamp got my attention, I broke it apart, trying to **** the pieces together, hoping it'd turn into my man. I acted like the silver lamp was my boyfriend, holding it affectionately.

Later, I was in my bedroom; watching a unsettling vhs tape. Sometimes it's a unknown disney tape. This is a reoccurring thing I dream about. I rewound the tape, trying to get past the end and credits of the video.

I was inside my sister and her boyfriend's house, staring into the mirror. It was dark and the lights were not on. I took pictures in front of the victorian door to the bathroom. Thinking that's where I was standing. It seemed I was actually in front of my niece's bedroom door. I stood in front of the bathroom mirror, in flannel pants, fleece material. I probably had a gray tank and flannel shirt on me. I took pictures, scared of the energy that was in the room. It felt like a ghost was watching; looking into the viewfinder and steading my hand, I called out for my partner to watch over me. Protect me from the other ghost in the room. The room had been renovated a little, covering the cobalt blue walls with white drywall. You could see the blue peak through it, unfinished probably. It was moist and shoddy. There's wooden art nouveau butterflys that were always on the blue walls when I was over there. Which I didn't see in here. I eventually looked in the other end of the room, seeing a closet. It was dark/unable to see. It was my niece's. I wondered why it was in the bathroom. I have a memory of feeling like a ghost was standing in front of that closet. So that's where the connection to that is.

I then transitioned into the next segment of the dream, going into a creepy deli store. My niece took me into the car with her great-grandma and other aunt. I wonder if I was borrowing her phone? probably. A few colonial homes were upahead, because we were about to pull in to her great-grandma's house. A mcdonalds inside of a house was at the end of the street, followed by black cages that were also black colored. The mcdonalds looked like a mausoleum on the front, floral pattern, mimicking wrought iron. We went inside, making me uncomfortable and feel unwanted. A surplus of food surrounded me. Stockpiles of food everywhere. My family could never afford this. I think I felt like I had used her phone, because I was inside her house. Too intimate for us, since we haven't talked since 2015. On my way out, I saw a box of something with apple, motts likely. It wasn't like the new streusel bars that are out now, it was even more luxurious. The apple was used in a streusel, sorbet, creme, etc. The dream literally transitioned into the next, taking me to that store. I walked there, by myself, into the building. No money to use. I was likely barefoot, bare on the inside too. I passed by a few aisles of stuff that was related to my memories. Bratz petz, bratz, celebrity endorsement products with late 90s/early 00s people, y2k stuff. A black guy approached me, instantly enthralled by my presence. I borrowed his phone, to take a picture of a wallace and gromit figurine. It was a bottle for a drink or even ice cream, shaped like him. On the bottom of the freezer shelf, touching the floor. He was slightly annoyed, standing up with me in front of a display that had glass mirroring our reflections. Our left arms were raised, holding a blue action figure. I made a comment about how virgo he is, trying to joke with him.

A few bundt looking cakes of creme brulee got my attention, reminding me of how poor I am. It would be expensive just to make it at home. I used my lucidity to picture and mention, 'brazillian cheese cake/bread.' I think that was what brazil-cheese food I was in the mood for. We both took notice of a deep blue milk with  jelly beans in it. Purple and green colored beans. Probably yellow too, or a different color. I lost my pants, and instead of fighting about losing my belongings, I just wanted to go home. I chose to leave with him, feeling a weight lift off of me. We passed so many people wearing clothes that looked exactly like clothing I owned, unwilling to search for my one pair of pants. When I'm watching movies, I'm **** and dysphoric if the main characters lose some material belongings. We weren't the only ones to have lost clothes in this store, apparently. Some snarky adults/old people harassed us, making us stop and answer '90s trivia if we wanted to leave. The questions I had were about the year 1997. ****, I wasn't born yet! It was questions for people who lived through the year '97. Ah ****, we're never gonna get out of here. I thought to myself. Somehow, we got out. We ran down the hall trail that led to outside, waking me up not long after.",2024-05-06 12:53:44
726,Dreams,I dreamed that I replaced madonna in a show,"I don't know **** was my brain thinking to give me a dream like that, because I'm not into following artists and I don't even like madonna music, I guess it's because of a show that she did recently here on brazil and I was hearing people talking about her a lot, well here how the dream goes:

I was in the backstage of a show of madonna with some people, then someone returned from the stage saying that madonna is too tired to continue and they need someone to replace her, everyone choosed me to replace her (I'm a guy), I was very nervous to do such thing, I asked what I should do on stage in front of everyone, one person said ""don't worry, just dress like her and go"", I put her clothes and appeared on stage, the public thought that I was madonna and was very happy, I was so nervous that I didn't knew what to do, I heard her music playing and recognized that she wasn't trully singing, I was confused about how people don't recognized me and asked to a person that was on the stage with me ""how they don't recognized me? I'm clearly a guy, my beard is appearing."", he answered ""don't worry, on these shows madonna never appears, we always replace her, the public is too **** to notice it"", after some time I woke up.

Honestly it was one of my most bizarre dreams that I ever had",2024-05-06 12:47:46
727,Dreams,"Exploring Death, The Meaning of Life, or Deep Thoughts","I’ll skip the in-depth details leading up to the main part of my dream. Basically this girl we’ll call “Natalie” for the story, broke a door in my house, I was livid, etc. 

So I stopped to walk down a separate door, and she followed me in, I think she wanted to figure out why I hated her. I don’t know how but I could sense she was sad as if I was sort of seeing her side of things too in a 3rd person pov for short seconds. This is where things get weird. Inside the door was a staircase going down. I was trying to get away from natalie so I ran down super fast and at the bottom was another door to another staircase. This time the staircase was going up so I ran up, which lead to another door, always checking if Natalie was behind me, trying my best to get away. This next staircase, was very strange, going up, each step looked like vertical smooth edge puzzle pieces, it was like I was climbing up a rock wall. When I reached the top there was no door, but a small rectangle shape cut out on the floor (imagine a vent but more wide) that you could only fit through by crawling. On the other side was a typical work office floor. It was saturated in a mixture of green and purple neon lights in the ceiling which replaced the typical fluorescent lighting. As I crawled into the office, the small space I crawled through ended up 7-8 feet high coming out through a wall in the office. I fell and landed on a table and in the motion of me rolling off the table I knocked over some pencils and papers which gave away to natalie that I had been there. I headed out the door of the office and found myself in another staircase, this one again, not a normal stair case, it was a small space surrounded by this purple/ pink rock like material, it resembled a McDonald’s playground, you could go up or down, but you had to climb back and forth through small gaps and weird shapes. This was my chance to escape natalie for good since there were so many directions to go I knew she wouldn’t find me. I once again had to get down and crawl through a super small rectangular space and entered another room saturated in a mix of green and pink light. Looking like an arcade, but was a big open room, I walked around and found a hallway with a big opening
Into another room. This room of course, being a dream, was very strange. Imagine in real life you’re playing VR and you are picking the game you want to play so you’re in a big open space with a
bunch of floating signs from left to right telling you which game is which. That’s what I looked like for me. But was way more creepy. There were 5-6 floating signs. I can only remember 3. They were, Exploring Death, The Meaning of Life, and Deep Thoughts. I chose to go with deep thoughts, the way I entered this “game” was by standing in a little indent in the ground like a bowl shape, with tape on it that read “stand here”. I stood on it then I pulled a handle on a chain above me. It was like the scene in Harry Potter where they traveled by standing in the toilet and flushing it. I arrived inside a bedroom. Keep in mind this whole time all the lights still gave the hazy, saturated color look to everything. I walked around the bedroom wondering how this was supposed to be “deep thoughts”. I was on my way to leave the bedroom when I saw a sign that said “try not to hear 80% of the sounds”. 
I was so confused. So I opened the door, assuming I shouldn’t try to hear a lot of sounds around the house so I just peeked out for a second assuming I’d be fine. As soon as I opened the door I saw that I was on the second floor of a huge mansion with a giant courtyard looking thing in the middle downstairs. I was looking right over the banisters. Out here the lighting changed to a blue saturated haze. After I saw everything I could, just other rooms across the courtyard and hallways (everything else was pitch black) I started to hear a fan buzzing, and the wind whooshing. I started hearing more and more noises like sensory overload which kind of freaked me out because it said TRY NOT TO LISTEN TO 80% OF THE SOUNDS. Just then, everything went quiet and from the long pitch black hallway to my right, I heard a soft girls voice say “who are you”.  my head snapped, I turned to look down the pitch black hallway, nothing. I then slammed the door and looked around the room for a second to see if there was another way to get out. I looked back at the door. There was a vertical rectangle window on the door, sort of resembling a classroom door, but there were blinds on it. Everything now was completely silent, although I was still freaked out because of the warning. I figured I had heard too much, I was fearing for what was going to happen. Just then through the half folded blinds I saw a big round grey head, it has super scaley skin, almost looked like the texture of a rock. I saw it’s mouth open. It’s exactly what you would expect from any demon in a horror movie. A smiling grin with layers of big razor sharp teeth. It was looking at me with eyes so squinted you couldn’t see it’s pupils. Just looked like a thin black line for eyes. It began trying to communicate to me but I couldn’t understand it. It either couldn’t speak so it was making noises or it couldn’t speak English, probably speaking a demonic language. It completely terrified me when I saw it, I didn’t know what was going on or why it was there. I saw a lock on the door, so I went for it,  jumped to the door quickly to lock it. It was one of those old fashioned locks where each “lock”  is connected to to the door from the wall. (Imagine the motel door lock movie scenes where they open the door a sliver then shut it to unpin it). After I had locked the door,  for some reason, that caused the “thing” to leave. I don’t know if I ever got out of the bedroom or if the thing came back, but that’s the last thing I can remember.

I wonder why my subconscious was trying to portray this as “deep thoughts” and what it meant. I am also curious what I would have found in the other 2 “games” “Exploring Death”, and “The Meaning of Life”. Maybe I’ll revisit the same dream soon.",2024-05-06 12:46:33

729,Dreams,Lucid entities,"Hello! I’ve been lucid dreaming and teaching astral travel for a few years now. However for the past year or so I’ve had weird **** happening, I haven’t found any information on entities in lucid dreams. They have been following me and trying to keep me from getting lucid. I’ve had few entities that have tried to “help” me in the dreams. Saying things like run before they get you or wake up wake up. **** like that. There is also a dream creator he calls himself. He’s caught me up once or twice saying he will **** me if I keep getting lucid. Obviously I just started flying away lol. But any info on the entities in dreams would be helpful and any experiences with them. I’m what feels like stuck they try to keep me inside places and don’t want me out flying around . I feel like they have taken my consciousness and put it on another plane of existence and I’m in a cardboard reality . That might not make sense but! Thanks !

730,Dreams,how to make it stop ,"i’m gonna try to keep it short. I ended up having the most dramatic, vampire draining, emotionally ab*sive relationship with a man I met last year that went on too long. stop talking in november, FINALLY moved on for good, I woke up finally at peace.

happier than i’ve ever been, blessings flowing to me, my life is full of light, I never think of him, never miss him, wish him the best. BUT right after I moved on, I ran into him in nyc (never ran into him before) the restaurant we had our first date starting popping up *everywhere* I couldn’t escape it, then people started trying to get me to go to his favorite bars (they didn’t know) and then last night he came in my dream and told me that “we are not done, there’s unresolved stuff, and he’s coming back for me” mind you he’s even appeared in my mothers dream two months ago.

um absolutely not, can someone PLS tell me what to do?? I would like go to bed peacefully ",2024-05-06 12:14:04
731,Dreams,Two dreams related to sexual assault.,"This is a bit difficult for me to talk about, but I should because I need opinions.  
TW: ****, **** assault, CSA, death/suicide

So, I'll start with the dream I had two nights before last.  
I was in a rather large mall, said to have over 6,000 restaurants in it. Well, by what I remember seeing on a poster. I remember my mother was there, and she said, ""Why isn't there Walmart?"" (Not sure why that was in this messed up dream).  
We walked out of the room we were in, which may have been some sort of bedroom. My stepfather walked out with us as well. We walked up some stairs and made it to a high, indoor overhang hall-like thing within the mall. We were walking down it when I spotted someone in front of us, who in my mind I saw as rather handsome. My stepfather turned to my mother and I, saying, ""he's a child molester.""  
Just as that was said, something strange happened. Someone jumped off the side of the overhang. People around paused before others, too, began jumping off — even my stepfather and mother. I rushed down to where they would have fallen, seeing multiple bodies and a lot of blood.  
I remember suddenly thinking, ""why would I dream this while regressed?"" (as in age regression, which is a trauma response/coping mechanism). Then, I woke up.  


The night before last, I had no dreams.  


Last night was even worse.  
I was at my grandmother's house, and there was some large party. Despite myself being rather shy, I walked around and introduced myself to people I didn't know and hanging out with the people I did know.  
I walked into the entryway room — which is rather large with a pantry and washing/drying machines — and saw just two people in there. I walked to the closest person, who looked rather shaggy and I remember he smelled terrible. Yet, I politely greeted him.  
The man gestured for me to come closer, so I did. He then whispered to me, ""I'm sorry you're so hot, but I'm going to **** you.""  
I was stunned and I remember barely even realizing he grabbed my wrist, forcing me to stay near him. I glanced to the other side of the room, where a man was gathering some papers. I breathlessly  — due to my intense fear, I couldn't talk or scream — asked the man for help. But, he didn't even glance my way and left the room.   
Another man walked in, so I asked him for help as well. This man looked at me with a sorry look, yet shook his head and left.  
Then, a woman walked in (who I feel could have been my sister). I mouthed ""help me"" to her, not even trying to talk anymore. She walked over and grabbed my arm, forcing the man to let go of me, and walked away with me close to her.  


  
Now for a bit of explanation on what's going on IRL, because that has to be some reason for my **** up dreams.  
Two days ago, I went shopping with my sister. We went to Walmart, Five Below, Walmart again...(funny how this was after my first dream). After we went to Walmart, I turned to my sister and said, ""I'm going to say this very simply, but Dad's messing up.""  
My sister asked for elaboration. So...I answered her.  
Basically, my father is abusive. Psychologically, physically...sexually.  
I feel that could explain last night's dream, why I was saved by someone who I felt was my sister.  
Please, do not try to give me advice on how to get out of my current situation btw. I've contacted CPS (who did nothing) and told my therapist about everything.  


Now, I also believe I was possibly **** by my father when I was ten years old. I've had odd ""memories"" (showing in dreams, smells, tastes, and feelings) that all seem to say something about ****. For the timing...I say it may have been around ten years old because at that time I gained an unexplainable cist in my gentile area. I did go to a gynecologist for it who asked me twice (before and after checking the cist) if I had been sexually active. Of course, I said no. He (odd for a gynecologist to be a man am I right) was unable to rule out the reasoning for the cist.  


But, yeah. That's my dreams and some explanation. I don't know why I had to add in the last part, but I feel it was possibly necessary. My mind is saying it is.",2024-05-06 12:05:11
732,Dreams,dream world,"when I was in high school one of my friends told me that he has a whole new identity in his dreams, he was sort of a warrior and had an army, and he could fight other people and some of them were evil or something, he even could meet anyone he knew in his dreams and travel etc. I once told him I was having recurring nightmares and he said someone might kept me prisoner in the dreams world, he said he could check up on me, at night I wrote his dreams world name on a piece of paper and put inside my clothes and went to bed... I was doing this just for fun I didn't think anything would happen but man that was the worst night I've had so far, I had the worst nightmares and were so vivid, I kept waking up from a nightmare to have another one and another one and I could feel everything like so real, I really started believing what he said was true after this.. it wasnt a game anyways the next day he told me I was no prisoner I was fine but I'm curious if anyone else have heard about this?

733,Dreams,Dreams about dead parents,"Okay, so my dad died 10 years ago. I just had a dream last night that he and my grandma who died about 7 years ago came back to life. However, in this dream everyone knew they had previously died and now are back. There was a timeframe of how long they could be around before leaving once again, but no one knew that timeframe. I was able to call and talk to my dad, have him pick me up, and I even tried asking how long I get to have him around.. but he couldn’t tell me.. I was only 10 when I lost my father, so i don’t have many memories with my dad, nor did I ever have the relationship where I could call him.. I’m just confused as to why I’m having this dream.. I’ve had it maybe 1-2 other times but it’s been a long while since then. ",2024-05-06 12:02:36
734,Dreams,Meeting the Two Tall Men and Seeing a Dream Anomaly,"I've been having a series of interesting dreams over the past several months. For some context, I have my own herbal tincture that helps me sleep and dream. It contains Motherwort, Lemon Balm, Mugwort, Passionflower, Blue Lotus, Skullcap and Valerian Root. It is a potent nervine relaxant that create a nice body calm and mental relaxation and yes, it does give me more vivid dreams. I also have been an active meditator for years now and just started doing the Monroe Institute's Gateway tapes.

**DREAM RECALL:**

Last night, the dream I had was relatively short. About a month ago, I had my first lucid dream where I became aware that I was dreaming. Last night, something similar happened. I was standing in my room and a really tall man was asking me questions. I got the impression that he was a UFO investigator not because that's what he revealed himself to be, but that was the thought that was in my head (or maybe there's part of the dream that I don't recall where that was revealed). I remember him having a sense of urgency and asking where his partner was a lot. At some point, we make our way outside (it's at night btw) and his partner appears and I notice an anomaly in my dream state. It was something that looked out of place in the dream. I don't remember exactly what it was, but it was off in the distance above the treeline (or perhaps above other houses? I can't remember exactly). I faintly remember it looking like a vortex of some sort.

I asked the two tall men (who I don't really believe were ""men"" if you catch my drift), ""hey do you see that?"" As soon as I acknowledged the anomaly, I woke up in my bed. 

**END**

I've been doing lots of research about lucid dreaming sometimes being a portal to astral traveling and remote viewing. I'm just going to put it out there...I get the impression that those men were aliens. Not to say I was really communicating with an entity, because I was still very much dreaming and on the verge of lucidity. But when I woke up, and thought about the two men...I remember looking up at them and seeing two large, alien-looking eyes. It's almost like, as I was becoming lucid...I was snatched out of the dream state. Maybe it was my ego preventing me from going further, maybe it was something else. IDK, but that's my dream.",2024-05-06 11:59:32
735,Dreams,"How do  i stop the thought ""This is a dream"" from waking me up from my lucid dreams","I'm not really a consistent dreamer due to poor sleep schedules and pickiness about writing in my dream journal, so on the occasion i get lucky and become lucid i'd like to prevent myself from waking up. which has happened 75% of the times

For someone to become lucid, they naturally have to come to the conclusion that ""this is a dream"" but i never thought that focusing on it even a little AFTER becoming lucid would instantly pull you out

I know youre not supposed to do it but i cant help but wonder if lucid dreaming is that unstable where an intrusive thought just kick you out?",2024-05-06 11:52:24
736,Dreams,recurring dream with an old 1-1 teacher? ,"hi! im just seeking an interruption / advice on my recurring dream as im kind of new to understanding dreams and all of this!! 

Some backstory: i got given a support worker whilst i was in college, she helped me with all my written work, and mental health requirements etc. by the end of my college year I would say i had gotten quite a lovely bond with her, i trusted her massively and got a lot of advice that i still use and apply in my own life 3 years on… i still have contact with her via WhatsApp too. 

She’s been recurring for around 7 months now... But recently they’ve turned weirdly ****? In my dreams i seem to enjoy it when she is that way??? I dream very realistically- so i always very clearly see her face. However: i am in a very happy stable relationship with a girl I love so much, so im finding these dreams extremely weird and uncomfortable. They make me wake up and feel disloyal. My girlfriend knows about these dreams too and reassures me but I can’t help how I feel with being so uncomfortable. 

I also have ocd which isn’t helping this at all… if anyone knows why this is happening or what it means please do let me know. I feel like it’s so wrong and im going insane with it.",2024-05-06 11:47:58
737,Dreams,Dream Journal #5: Bus ride,"Had a dream where i was on a bus coming back from a trip with my sister. It started being a very normal dream but then we started talking with everyone on the bus and slowly we all got to know each other really well.

 The bus continued but things started happening, we were attacked by looters, the bus broke down after a while and we had to switch to a Cadillac lol (and yes, everyone on the bus had to fit in the car now), then the car broke down and we had to push it up a muddy hill next to a cliff where some dolphins were going crazy and trying to eat the car.

After that, things calmed down and we stopped to buy a type of cake that i tried once in Morocco irl but can't remember the name. Luckily one of the girls from the bus was from Tanger and she got us a good deal on the cakes so we ate a lot of it. After a while we arrived to our destination but the trip was not over yet. When we got out of the car a group of people with basketballs and rugby balls where there waiting for us, and they wouldn't let us through if we didn't win in a match against them, so we played until we won. 

Then right before the end of the trip, we found like a small door in an alley, and decided to investigate, but right as we stepped in i recognized the room. It was from another dream that i had a while ago where we got stuck in a room with gore 'puzzles' like in the Saw movies, but every trap was toy themed. So basically we got the **** outta there before anyone stepped into a trap, but it was cool seeing a place from a other dream just appear like that.

So anyway, we had to take the subway to get home, so we all went there and before i left to go home i said goodbye to all of them, told them i was very glad that we all met that day on a random bus trip, and wished them a happy life, as we would probably never see each other again (now that i know it was all a dream that last part hits different lol).

739,Dreams,"Explicit dream about Satan (insanity, I know)","I had a vivid dream where a completely red, lanky, horned devil was on top of me. His eyes were completely black and I couldn’t say anything from shock and he was saying something and telling me to look into his eyes and then he had **** with me.

It felt insanely real, it was all set in my room, and the lights were off just like I had left them. I clearly remember looking into their pitch black eyes-not just the pupil, the entire eye in the socket was black- and he had animalistic, terrifying bumpy blood red face. 


I’m curious if this means anything, because it was clear as day to me this was Satan in the dream. It was the devil. I am not religious at all, I’ve never been into anything like that, so I’m curious if this could mean anything?",2024-05-06 11:02:46
740,Dreams,Dreaming about my old crushes,"I been having reoccuring dreams about school the last couple months, this one specifically is the third one I had this week. 


I’m back in highschool and I remember being really angry. I walk into class late and see my two old female friends I had crushes on but was too scared to tell them sitting together. I walked up to them and we started talking, what about I forgot. but then a student said something to me in spanish, I felt like he was insulting me so I beat him up over that but he started begging me to stop and I remember the whole class being quiet and just looking at me. 

Then the weirdest part of the dream where my teacher gave me a cup and told me go **** it for my drug test. Thats also when I woke up. Does anybody else have experience with these type of dreams

741,Dreams,Weird dream where I basically told my narrator to f*** off,"I'll skip most of the random details because they made zero sense leading up to the scene I'm going to talk about. Basically, I dreamt that I accidentally left a kitten in my car, and I had to get a lift back to my car to get it out. By the time I got there, it died of a heat ****. Throughout the entire dream there was a narrator that dictated everything that happened, and at that moment he said ""The kitten had died from a heat stroke"", and I proceeded to climb out of the car, kitten in hand, looked to the sky and said ""no""...""he didn't"", in the most casual voice, like this was a common occurrence, lol. And then the kitten was alive again. I don't really remember the narrator saying anything after that.   
  
Side note, why do such random, bizarre things seem normal when we are dreaming?? Alright, that's all I had to say.  ",2024-05-06 10:39:33
742,Dreams,I saw the physical form of death in my dream. What could that mean?,"There is a dream that has stuck with me for years, I was maybe 19 when I had it, and I really want to know what it means because I can not shake it. My mind always goes back to it.

I woke up and glanced at the foot of my bed. Standing there, still as a statue, was Death. Death reached its hand out and I can remember feeling calm, I was not scared of it at all I was relaxed and it felt as if a friend came to say hi. I rolled over, pulled the blankets around me some more, closed my eyes and whispered ""not yet."" 

Then I actually woke up. That feeling of calm, no fear, has stuck with me and I can stoll picture Death standing at the foot of my bed. 

It was so vivid, and I have not have a dream like that since. What could it mean? ",2024-05-06 10:31:37
743,Dreams,Dreams that have emotional effects after waking.,"I had a silly dream recently. I was hungry when I went to sleep this night. 

I dreampt that I woke up after my family had gone to sleep. I walked into the kitchen and saw an Arbys fast food paper bag, And a rallys fast food paper bag on the counter. 

I go to look inside the bags and theyre completely empty. 

In my dream, I start crying. So physically upset that I was hungry and my family got food but didnt get anything for me. 

Then I actually woke up....dazed and confused about why I felt like I had just been kicked in the stomach with actual tightness in my chest - real emotional pain. 

And then it dawned on me. My family didnt buy me food in my dream. Hah.

746,Dreams,Beautiful Dream Girl,This was just last night that I had a relatively short dream where I was sitting in this big room with my dad and some other random people. I think it was like a party or something and I remember seeing this girl my age that was so beautiful. I don’t remember much about her appearance but that she had blonde hair and was white but that’s it. I don’t remember how it happened but I think I asked if she could be my girlfriend and she said yes. But throughout the dream she kept disappearing in the crowd of people and I was just looking for her throughout the entire dream. Once I had found her I was very happy but she seemed kinda uninterested in me and wanted to keep walking. That’s all I remember before I woke up. It’s weird how I can feel such love for a person when I can’t even remember what they look like. I’m trying to write more about her but it’s hard for me to put it into words without it not making sense. It’s like she had some aura around her that made her seem not even real like not even human I know it sounds ****. I’ve just been thinking about her all morning and I don’t know what to do.,2024-05-06 09:32:59
747,Dreams,I sometimes can’t tell my dreams from reality,"I have very vivid dreams, very long ones where a lot of stuff happen in them. 

So this happened like yesterday, I was going home and I suddenly thought I had sent an inappropriate picture to one of my guy friends where I was in the bath asking him to join me and I was like “why the **** did I send that I have to delete it” but when I got to our dc messages, I realized that I didn’t send anything.

I was so confused as to why I would’ve dreamt of something like that. 

And then, today, I watched the stranger things cast puppy interviews, where Finn mentions my favorite song of all time “This is the day by the the” and I was like, “aww it’s a **** shame that it wasn’t real and was just in my dream” but then I thought it through and I was like “wait it actually did happen”. 

Does this happen to anyone else?

749,Dreams,werid but instering dream I had,"a few days a ago I had this dream where I had found out about this tourist atraction that was in some country that I can't remember, when I got to the toursit atraction I apeared to be the only one there, It on a highway and it was a giant warehouse that was like 10x bigger than an airport, there was no doors or windows so i had to climb these stares which leaded to a small crack which i managed to fit through. When i got into the warehouse I was standing on top of some dead grass, it was completly dark in there but when my eyes adjusted I could see that there was hills of dead grass that where in sqaure shaped and they looked like they had been man made. When I was looking at this weird landscape i realised that I could barley see the end of the warehouse which made me realise how big it actually was. I stepped back out of the crack because i had the feeling that there where squatters or some animals lurking in there, when headed back to my car i bumped into some man that had seemed to of already been here, I asked the man if he knew anything about this weird warehouse and he told me the full story: So basically back in the 80s there was going to be some upcoming wilderness surviving reality shows like ""Survivor"" or ""Bear grills"" it was basically just about people trying to survive in the wild, but for some reason the directors and filmers didn't want to film in an actual forest so they build a whole entire landscape that was said to go on for miles in that giant warehouse, but the whole tv show got cancled for unknown reasons.",2024-05-06 08:39:31
750,Dreams,Sticky sweets and a Korn mosh pit,"I get some the weirdest dreams that don't seem to make any sense.

Last night's dream, I was at a concert venue. The audience area was an open concrete pad. To my left (facing the stage) was a shaded sitting area. There were steps leading down to a boardwalk with other bars and restaurants. 

The Korn concert was about to start and the audience area was full. A mosh pit broke out when the music started. I quickly left the pit because it was way too violent. 

The next scene had me in the shaded sitting area eating what I can only describe as McDonald's apple pies. I looked out to the concert audience and it was empty. Only a few people remained. I turned around to see my friend's ex wife and she said to me ""I don't know why he gets like that when he's drinking"". I shrugged it off and called him. He appeared but acted like he just wanted to be left alone. He and his ex wife went down the stairs to the boardwalk. I stayed back for a minute to finish my pies then went down the stairs to find them.

751,Dreams,"Dream Analysis with Emotions, Themes, AI interpretation on Lucidity","Hi dreamers!

Some may remember me from about 10 years ago when I first posted about my app, [Lucidity](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.b3nz.lucidity&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US). After that, the river of life took me in its flow and the app was let aside for about 8 years. A few months ago, with the advent of AI, and after a personal trip that changed my life, I decided to get back on Lucidity and make it become the best dream journaling and lucid dreaming app out there, and I’m still pursuing this goal and working **** it.

This week, I’m excited to have released a major update to the app with **integrated Dream Analysis**!

# How does it work?
After writing down a dream, you can click the “Analyse my Dream” button, and Lucidity will automatically:
-  Extract your **Emotional state** during the dream
-  Find the **Themes appearing in the dream**
-  Give you an **AI interpretation** of the dream
-  Give you a small **Dream Insight** specially crafted just for you!

I think the analysis is pretty cool, but what’s even better is that this allows to **classify dreams, connect them together, and find dreams that are similar or have recurrent patterns.** I’m currently working on this part with advanced statistics, and it will release in the coming weeks!

You can download the app for [android here](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=ch.b3nz.lucidity&amp;hl=en&amp;gl=US).

For iOS users, good news! The app is coming at the end of this summer 2024. You can sign up to receive an email when it’s out [iOS here](https://luciditydreams.com/ios-release-notification/).

If you want to read more about the dream analysis I wrote an article on my blog:

User experience, user feedback, and excellent customer service are some of the core values that I strive for in this project; so I’m listening if you have any comments or suggestions. Thanks!",2024-05-06 08:33:52
752,Dreams,"Old lady in white, Why..something..something..evil? What's Leah Remini doing here","I was in a science lab with different people locked in cages and different scientist doing experiments.

The first was a younger guy in a cage and a lady scientist, it was Leah Remini kept asking this same question over and over, ""Why is... I can't remember.. Why is something evil? it had a name in there somewhere. 

Anyway she started the experiment on the guy by hooking wires up to him and she implemented everything evil from the internet the guy started foaming at the mouth and when it was over he whispered to **** him. Few moments after the guy got up really energized with red skin and a some guy went into the cage with him and they started ****, the red skin guy started saying stuff but I don't remember.

It then cut away to Leah Remini talking to 3 old ladies in a cage she said ""See those were easy questions weren't they"" the 2 old ladies were frightened and were hugging each other. I was just standing there watching. The 3rd old lady in white stood up with her mouth wide open and eyes bugged out. The 2 scared ladies got up and walked to the corner of the cage while I was still standing there not moving the old lady in white grabbed me that's when I started panicking and screaming. She threw me on the bed and used both her fist slammed them down on me and that's when I woke up breathing heavy. ",2024-05-06 08:31:50

But still, from time to time I have dreams about her. Can't tell what the dreams about, I can't remember. But I know shes there and very next thing when I woke up I want to meet her, text her, etc. It fades in the same day, my logic wins, I think, but I don't like her anymore, we are different....

Even **** tiktok reminds me of her, even though I don't follow her or nothing, I get notification when she post something, does my phone like to joke with me to? Not just my head but even my phone.

758,Dreams,Two Dreams That I Can't Forget,"**Dream 1**

The first dream happened roughly 4 years ago. It was entirely from my POV, and I was some sort of medical scientist. I spread a serum on a badly injured patient (4th degree burns, extreme necrosis, gangrene, missing arm, etc), which healed him quite rapidly.

Then a nurse that looks and sounds like a Deadite from Evil Dead barges through the door and tells me that I'm going to die. Suddenly, I was grabbed from behind, and look around to see the patient (who's regenerated to the point where it looks like his flesh is mostly pink) is restraining my chest and neck. At that point, I very nearly jumped out of bed.

**Dream 2**

The second dream was from less than a month ago, and this time it was more of a third person story that follows a girl as she's being chased through dark streets by a monster. Fyi, this monster had the build/proportions of Jason Voorhees, the clothes of The Creeper, and the face of Freddy Krueger.

She eventually runs into a shopping centre (think Rundle mall, but covered in screens, glass and neon lights), until she runs by a television. The television stars playing a BBC-esque documentary about some retconned history where the killer is basically the best guy in history, the ruler of humanity, and has 'overthrown tyrants and conquerors' (\*flashes to old paintings of popes and kings\*). She then exclaims 'what the f\*ck', and I woke up.

**Questions**

I have three questions about these dreams that I'd like to ask.

Firstly, why can I remember virtually everything about these dreams? I've had more recent dreams, even ones where I've woken up just after (especially due to fear or elation), yet I can't remember anything more than fragments of these dreams.

Secondly, why do I know details that weren't even part of the dreams? For example, I knew that I developed the serum in the first dream to heal the injured/sick and that it was responsible for the nurse becoming one of these creatures, but that was never part of the dream.

Lastly, how do I channel this kind of creativity into my story telling? I scarcely ever have original thoughts for stories, let alone something as ridiculous as the second story.

Sorry if this feels like some stream of consciousness, shower thoughts kind of thing.",2024-05-06 08:07:17
759,Dreams,being drugged for several months by a stranger ,"*hi everyone! i just wanted to post this dream as i am quite confused by it, and wanted to see if anyone could give me any insight on it ^-^ !!*

My memory has forgotten certain aspects of most of the dream but I know there was a part where I was driving and escaping the police like it was GTA at one point. I started playing some music and it was a really sad song I had apparently made before. It had my old mixes and everything and I was confused on if I preferred that mix or my newer mixes.
I got to this building and lost the cops, just like on GTA. I don’t really remember why but I ended up stealing a cop car but then got called by the cop I had stolen from right after. It was a woman, and we were sorta flirtatious with each other. She proposed that if I gave her back her car then she wouldn’t arrest me and also would give me the car that she used to get to me, which she proposed was a Mercedes. When she got there, it was actually a van, but I was still interested in it, which was weird. Maybe it was the fact that it was still a car? From this point I don’t really remember much. I remember waking up in my room feeling very dazed and feeling like a lot of time had passed. I remember at one point being with this person and shopping for Halloween with her. Keep in mind we met around September of this year. I remember looking at lashes that had chocolate on them and wanting to get it. She also found some Halloween-style lashes that she wanted to get too, but after that, I don’t really remember much. I just remember being very withdrawn, controlled and obsessed with this person, although my memory whilst being asleep **in my dream** is very vague. I just know that one day I woke up not wanting to eat anything she was giving me as I knew something was up. I asked her what day it was and she told me it was Christmas. That upset me because I thought I missed my 20th birthday. After doing some digging and checking my phone I found out it was November, which was still shocking because that meant I was still knocked out for two months. Once I noticed this I immediately ran downstairs and told my mum that someone was drugging me and that I needed her removed from the house. At this point I memories came back to me of there being another time that I refused to eat something I was being given by her but ended up being tackled and forced to eat it. Once I remembered this, I made sure to be extra careful when dealing with her this time. She came downstairs but for some reason was in the form of a child. **I met her as an adult and she WAS an adult up until this point**. It was almost as if my sister was trying to wind me up, but it wasn’t her. it was someone who was simply her height. I didn’t really get a good look at this person so I don’t know how they looked. At this point of the dream, I told her she needed to leave. Even my mum also said so. She started refusing, so I picked her up and put her out. She kept finding a way to open the door but I made sure to bolt it, even though she kept finding a way to unbolt the door too. I then asked my sister to go outside to keep the person distracted. She did a great job of that, but it also seemed like I was kicking her out too, which I am sure I wasn’t. Whilst she was distracting her, I ran up the stairs and found as much of the person’s clothes as I could, bundled them up and threw them outside to her. I don’t remember what happened to the person after this, but I remember my mum saying that I owed her an apology. (*we recently fell out so this could be something in my subconscious*) I then proceeded to apologise to her deeply and even started crying. I was happy to be safe again. I no longer had someone manipulating me and my sense of time. It felt a lot better.

TL;DR: stranger i met drugged me for months to mess with my perception of time, and I kicked her out once noticing this…

760,Dreams,I hit the ground ,"Soooo I’ve always had dreams where I was falling but I don’t remember ever hitting the ground. 

In this dream I tried to jump from very high into the middle of a big body of water. But it was windy I was blown all over the place and ended up hurtling towards the ground away from the water. In the dream I remember thinking I was at terminal velocity because I’d been in the air so long and was travelling so fast I knew I’d die. But then there was this moment of acceptance and just being like ‘ok this is it, goodbye’ no screaming, no panic, just chill. 

Then I hit the ground and remember it being really sore and I tried to get up and walk but I couldn’t and I was all messed up. 

That’s all I remember.

The second time I dreamt I died was when there was a killer in my house, so I went to my room to hide but saw there’s no where to hide so I laid on my bed stomach facing down and closed my eyes knowing he was coming and felt the knife stab my back I felt real pain like actually stab me

767,Dreams,I had a dream where I was crazy,"Since I am not good in English, I translate this text, so there may be mistakes.

I had a dream where I was a young adult moving away from home, from a small village near the snowy mountains. I only took a few clothes and a briefcase of coins with me. I started wandering to another, bigger city I wanted to move to. After reaching the place, I saw some strange things like a flying house.However, I thought that this was normal, because I had never been outside my village before. I entered a small stall that had been set up from fabrics and wooden beams.I wanted to buy a home there, and during the payment phase I opened the briefcase.To my surprise, however, there was nothing there, but looking around, I noticed that the wind had thrown the money against the wall of the opposite house. I tried to grab all the money I could get out of the air, I was already panicking, but the seller of the house started shouting something, grabbed me and knocked me unconscious. I woke up later in a small room to a knock on the door. A woman entered and smiled at me as if I were a child.I asked where I was and got the answer that they were worried about me and I had been sent to a mental hospitalI asked where I was and got the answer that they were worried about me and I had been sent to a mental hospital. I tried to convince them that this was just a misunderstanding, but I could see from their expressions that they didn't believe me. After a few days I tried to run away. The next time the woman opened the door, I rushed out as hard as I could. I succeeded for a while, but then I was knocked unconscious again and woke up in a mental hospital. Only the third escape attempt was successful. I found a small hut with an open door and hid under the bed. I waited there for a few hours until a group of people a little younger than me entered the lodge and started waiting for something. I finally decided to try to infiltrate them, and to my relief I was successful in the attempt. After a while, an older adult, a large man, entered the hut and asked everyone to follow. I decided to go along and started walking up the hill towards to see the small camp center. One of the young people started chatting nicely and told us where we were going. I found out that we were participating in an art camp. Everyone acted like I always belonged there, and when I woke up I wondered if I really had gone crazyEveryone acted as if I had always belonged there, and shortly before I woke up, I wondered if I had really been crazy.

768,Dreams,computer virus dream?,"So, I've had this dream about 3-4 times but only when I think they're gone do they pop up. The dream started with my mom on my computer trying to go on an online school website and the one I know is real is NOT popping up on Google at all. The only website I remember from this dream was ""19 . um"" (Please don't go to that, I don't know what it is.) Every time she clicked one, it automatically started logging in and giving our information away to fake websites. She clicked on one (one that gave me a computer virus in the dream) and some virus downloaded called ""REBSTERS"" (I think?) which I'm sure was supposed to be Red Lobster because the logo was a red lobster, which would be weird cause I've never been there. It kept popping up error messages like a lot of viruses would. I couldn't get help because my phone wasn't there and neither was hers. After that I woke up, my heart was beating really fast. I don't remember anything more than this though. ",2024-05-06 07:02:40

772,Dreams,Violent dreams,"A couple days ago I was telling my girlfriend that I die and/or **** someone in at least 90% of the dreams I remember having, and she seemed really concerned. Her reaction confused me, because this has been the case for almost my entire life, and at this point I’m **** to it that it didn’t even strike me in the moment that it’d be alarming for someone else to hear that. A lot of my intrusive thoughts in my waking life (of which there are many) are either me committing acts of violence or having then committed upon me, so it makes perfect sense that I have so many dreams like this. I’ve also talked to several therapists about my dreams and intrusive thoughts before because I was worried that I was a sociopath, so I suppose I have already made my peace with the level of violence occurring in my subconscious.

775,Dreams,Spine chilling old lady in people's dreams?,"To clarify, this dream was out of my control however I had conscious of myself only. I was able to move and talk in full control and the dream felt like 6-8 hours though it was 2.  Scariest **** I have ever experienced whilst dreaming. I had a lucid dream that began quite nice and quickly abrupted into havoc. There was an old lady faintly similar to this woman from Shameless. Originally I was treated kindly by her and she was some sort of waitress or server at this restaurant me and a few mates were at (none of this was even close to reality) and she stopped me on our way out. The woman pinned me against the wall and began hugging me very sensually, groping my back and rubbing my sides. I got her off me and began leaving to go to the car as my SO came to me and asked if anything was going on or something being wrong. The lady came back and tried to begin touching me again so I, no joke, grabbed her arm and slung her into a car. She violently slammed into the car and planted head first on the ground, I felt like I had blood on my hands. I continued leaving and she approached me in a lobby of some sort. She, again, pressed me against a wall and began hugging on me and harassing me. Everytime she would get close to me or touch me she would be smiling like she was in love with me or something saying ""It's ok!"" In a comforting voice. The nightmare has left me restless and super paranoid. She's engraved in my mind and im worried if I sleep again she will come back. If the dream reoccurs I will update.. 

I spoke to my partner and she told me she has had the same woman and apparently others she know have aswell in the past month or so. This woman was super polite however there was some kind of evil to her. Her look in my eyes and the way she smiled was something out of a movie.

776,Dreams,Really confused ,"Just woke up from a dream that isn't easy to forget...

It started at a place I didn't recognise, kinda looked like a private school. The only class I remember is the science lab where they had everything under lock and key. The only faces I recognised was my mother, step dad, son, and my sister. 

I had been snooping around the school and found a room full of cages that had people in them. Alot of them were seriously injured or near death. I talked to this one girl that was in there and found out that all these people were run aways that were caught and brought here to be used for testing for bio weapons. They would either harvest flesh off people to test their bio weapons on or they would take one of the run aways in to the lab and secure them to a bed or table and watch the effects of what ever invention they had created and the effects on a living test subject. Well one day things went very wrong and the subject had coughed on one of the w scientists, infecting them. This bio weapon was one that started to turn your organs in to liquid. You would start coughing up large blood clots and eventually die from blood loss. They locked down the lab thinking they could contain it but that was far from the truth. Somehow I got infected and started coughing up large blood clots. I ran to the medical part of the building which some how I end up at a hospital.  I went to one of the bathrooms to cough so I didn't consurn anyone, and my sis was there. When she seen how much blood I was losing, she ran out of the bathroom. I tried to get medical help but every one became panicked.  ",2024-05-06 05:23:18

780,Dreams,i need help identifying my dream,"so i know dreams have meanings, but mine was quite real and if so had many layers i need help identifying the msg its trying to tell.



the dream: 

i was in a small movie theater looks hand made like in a rich persons house, each row had cameras look at all of us watching some sort of documentary or movie, i was jealous of someone in the movie saying i should have one but they did instead,

i made a funny joke into the camera in my row winked in the camera and told some girl that was sitting next to me in my row, ""i how they send me that clip, they have my email, i know they do"". it then cuts to us in a large town home, most are in the kitchen talking then the lights go out, there must have been a skip in time and with all the lights out in the house i sat next to a kid with a face mask texting on his cell while 2 others in electric scooters where next to us, the kid on the cell was muttering someone along the lines of ,""dont make her mad"", i was confused in till he started to bully the old lady to the left of me in her electric scooter and for no reason i yelled at her, ""SHES CGI,SHES CGI""!!!

she then gets up and turns into this wierd old lady monster with a very large grin on her face, weird thing is, instead of her trying to **** me, i some how turned her back to normal, by closing my eyes and putting a blanket in front of me for 2 secs, then a rowdy party of what sounded like kids across the street started getting very loud, she turned back into the monster, slammed open the front door and ran after the party to i guess ""punish them"", i ran outside and saw no car in the driveway saying to the others that where with me, ""they took the car and ran, wtf"", i turn back at the house, one of the kid that was hiding in the house drove off on a bike i guess to save the kids and i look back at the house seeing about maybe 5 others running out of the house, i started foucesing on a parked pickup truck with a fishing boat on a trailer and my dream ends....

i know dreams can make no sense, but idk why i figuratively remember this entire dream, with people ive never met, places ive never been.





can anyone tell me what or if it means anything or multiple things?",2024-05-06 04:29:44
781,Dreams,A plane that won't gain altitude.,"Hello everyone, 

  
I just joined, and I am writing this while it's fresh; I woke up five minutes ago and it's already fading. I am requesting your interpretations, as plane-related dreams keep happening to me. In some, I'm piloting them; in some, I am on the ground watching them crash. I always go ""Hey, that plane is way too close to the ground,"" and then it takes a nosedive a few blocks away from where I am. 

Tonight's dream, though, was particularly strange, long, and violent.

The dream starts with me and other passengers running along the pavement, chasing a ticketing kiosk where our tickets are processed. For some reason, mine includes a questionnaire about the currency I'm bringing with me. 

Airline employees are running all over, and they rush me into the plane. I am worried that my documentation has stayed behind, as if they've kept my passport, but I am shown to my seat. It's in the back of the plane; however, in front of me, there's an open window which covers the width of the wall. I have a massive view of the world outside, as if this was the front seat on the second floor of a double-decker bus. The seats look old and worn off. 

The plane takes off; the terrain is mountainous with snow-capped peaks. The plane is flying, but it never truly gains altitude; we keep flying just above the ground, nearly missing houses and trees. There is a climate of hostility among the passengers; I feel as though I'll be attacked. 

Then the plane is suddenly landing, and it is being transported on the top of some vehicle across a city. I remember still images of that city, it looked old, like one of those picturesque Italian villages, but bigger. Fights break out among the passengers, and when those are resolved, we are shooting into the sky again, but I look out the windows and the turbines are no longer there; they appear to be rocket boosters. We fail to gain altitude again, but the world beneath us is now covered in water. Cities are being covered by waves, and the storm is forcing us down. 

We are now stranded. Outside, there are massive floating structures, like rafts. Fights between passengers begin again, and this time they're very violent, physical and over the top. I'm seeing people killing one another, and even I am forced to fight, but when I leave the aircraft and hop into a raft, I notice passengers are tying balloons to the structures; we're beginning to float again, on those gray rafts. We continue toward our destination.

I have no idea what any of this means. I'm not even sure I believe dreams *have* meanings at all, but some version of ""plane won't gain altitude"" keeps playing in my head, and I have no idea why. 

I'm mainly curious about what other people think. ",2024-05-06 03:41:43
782,Dreams,Please help me the dream is getting to me ,"I had a really horrifying dream and i think it genuinely traumatized me . 

First for context , this dream happened during a 1 hour nap , but in the dream it was like 8-9 days , there was no skips in that dream , i lived through the entire 8-9 days , every second 

The dream took place where i lived , it was an exact replica , it was mostly people i knew 


It started normally , i was hanging out with my family , in the parking lot outside , we were playing cards , it was a fun time , then a friend of mine asked if she could drive my new car , i said yes , she was just driving around near us going back and a fourth , then she she started taking more time between every lap , until she finally just stopped passing bye entirely , i even said jokingly that ill call the cops if she takes more than another hour . Then i heard my little sister calling for help running towards us. I ran to her , only to find ( please bare with me i know this sounds completely made up and it does make no sense) , rachel ( from friends ) she was a friend of mine in the dream , her right hand was cut off at the wrist, it was bleeding an awful lot , she said our friends were getting attacked, i ran there , to find the rest of the friends cast laying in the middle of the street, all bloody, missing limps and chunks of meat , then rachel just turned into something close to the terminators that turn their hands into huge blades and started cutting at what was left of who ever was still alive , i grabbed my little sister and ran to my car , that rachel asked to drive earlier, as i was running to the car with my sister inhand i got a couple of slashes on my back from the thing , i managed to make it home with my sister, on the second day , was news showed that there a global outbreak, and it wasnt any sort of virus, all we knew that it would switch to new host once the host got weaker , right after the news i tuned into one i killed all of my family, there was so much blood , there was no blur no nothing , it was just gore and blood it was horrendous, nothing i can say can even get close to the things i did , it was like my body was being controlled and i was just watching things unfold  , there was so much detail that it felt so real , i could also feel pain , never knew that was possible in dreams , i could feel everything, as I slaughtered my family , after that the thing just hid , there was no one else close to **** i ran to our medication cabinet, I remember chugging down an entire box of tramadol and lyrica hoping it coud **** me , it didn’t, to summarise the rest , i was stuck for the remainder of the dream while the thing took control , slaughtering every human it saw , every animal , any living thing , every **** , had so much detail , so much blood, i feel like i can remember all of it , ive been struggling for the past 3 days , i know this sounds ridiculous , but it feels like i killed them , please help me , it’s starting to get to me .

783,Dreams,I dream episodes from another life / another person,"A bit of a weird one, this.

  
First of all, context, quite a lot of it.  
  
Me: I always had trouble sleeping (since childhood), I was either a very light or very deep sleeper and that continues well into my 40s. My day/night cycle has also been out of sync since forever, so as a consequence, I might end up where at 1800 I'm tired physically, but my brain is not, so while my body takes a nap, my brain just ""surfs"" sleep, so to speak. For this dream to occur, it has to be a nap, I have to be tired but mentally alert. If I can bring these conditions about, I'm almost guaranteed to have it.

  
Dream context: The dream isn't a single one. Imagine watching a long running soap opera or anything serialized. You watch an episode from season one, then skip it for 5 episodes, watch one again and you kinda have to fill in the blanks as to what happened in the series to whom, context, events and so on. You're missing things, but the behavior and actions / speech of characters helps you orient yourself and by the end of the episode it is like you didn't miss any episodes at all.

That is why I'm hesitant to straight up call these serialized ""dreams"" just a dream, since they feel more like glimpses into another life. But since I'm an engineer by trade, education and mindset, I'm a bit wary of jumping to such hypotheses, though I must admit, it does feel kind of fitting.

Dream character: whatever the main character does for a living is inconsequential (something technical), because the context I encounter it in, is always about old cars. Taking them to be serviced, buying, selling, driving, hunting parts. Central European setting,

Start of the dream: the most confusing ever, because I ""drop"" into the dream with either me having to do something to a car, but I don't know what car, where the **** did I park it, why is this person talking to me about it, wait what/who/where/when. But in a minute or so I get my bearings, things ""come back"" to memory (which is a weird sensation, remember in a dream about another dream) and I start filling in the blanks from the ""episodes"" I haven't seen/dreamt. Yesterday it was about an old Skoda I bought for some reason (for context, I am a motorcycle rider, I drive extremely rarely, know next to nothing about cars), which needed bodywork and I had to take it on a trailer to a bodyshop. I ""remembered"" that I parked it in ""my lot"". Drive there, find the Skoda, also find that two other project cars have been finished in the episodes I missed and now they're ready to go on sale. Load it up on the trailer, take it to the bodyshop, where I have a conversation with the shop owner, a confusing one, because he kept referencing another job that I don't ""remember"", but I act along like I know what he's about, drop the new car, end the conversation and leave, relieved that I've faked it well enough to make it through the day, wake up in real life.

There are also dialogues or things I need to do/places I need to go to. But I can never reach the final point of my journey.

788,Dreams,An elaborate nightmare about a screamer vid," 

this morning before waking up i had an elaborate nightmare that i still remember enough to write down and it affected my ability to wake up

so in my dream i saw news of a screamer video that is so frightening that people are being prohibited from watching it and the government are making attempts to keep everyone from watching it

spreading warnings and taking down any reuploads of the vid on the internet

apparently the video came from a disc meant to be played on a PS1 of all places and the ones circulating on the internet is ripped from the disc

people who watched it are reacting extremely towards it  
some victims are seen hysterically crying  
the situation is so dire that everyone was making sure their beloved doesnt watch it  
my parents warned me to look out just in case i stumbled upon the video  
a friend called me to make sure im okay and haven't watched the vid

after it i saw my hand holding a disc

idk how i know it  
or how it came into my possession  
but its the disc that contains the screamer vid  
i contemplated on ripping the video myself to see if it actually does what the news said  
but eventually i decided against it

then i saw the news again  
there is a mockup screenshot of the screamer video  
a painting of a cupboard (or cabinet?) with a head of a woman slowly appearing from the right side of the screen  
i tried to illustrate it below 

&amp;#x200B;

https://preview.redd.it/f22k1vyk5ryc1.jpg?width=810&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;s=920f46ca3ab88271fe6a7f0dc3e50ae5954a7d53

weirdly enough  
the mockup didnt displayed that a scary picture popping up or a loud scaring sound playing after it

after seeing it  
i saw many of the screamer videos i know one by one  
complete with the screamer sounds  
before waking up

.

now for my speculations about that dream

for one i am aware that the ps1 part came from me trying to rip stuff from a ps1 game recently  
and also the cupboard part is cause i played a **** mystery themed hidden object game recently   
so my brain definitely put it there

as for the screamer vid  
i cant decide if its an actual haunted cursed video  
or an elaborate crafted psychological attack

i think the screamers flashing in my dreams before waking up  
is the effect of the forbidden vid

its causing the phenomenon of getting scared by the anticipation of something but to an extreme degree  
the victims that saw the vid could be experiencing mentally scaring images from their own minds

idk what to make of this  
if someone wanna write a horror project or an scp entry out of this go ahead

 

a friend pointed out that i apparently just saw something like this

[https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dybbuk\_box](https://en.m.wikipedia.org/wiki/Dybbuk_box?fbclid=IwZXh0bgNhZW0CMTAAAR0FsGGE-U82YtyTiHH6oEXBObDsRhBaHoI3yKXiDitm0V1-cXFQE_5xg50_aem_AZBjOzraE1-4nkHH_SX4HraG1ughtKA6r6IN1xvZNJicTKxsI5dHSUiC6RpHbVQQAHqN24Y07swIaDbed3qr6iR-)

789,Dreams,Some of the Monsters in a Reoccurring Dream Series,"
All aliens: have a hive mind. 

Converted humans have two fates: be left behind as eyes and ears for the aliens or be taken by hazmats to the ship for further expiraments if they show leadership qualities and have a mind that’s hard to control.

Big boi: shrinks on command to find a specific target, but is otherwise huge like Godzilla size. Is fast but clumsy. Zig zag running is best to escape him or if you can sense him coming, hide. 

Entity- can sense when you want to be outside of your body and when you’re hungry. Looks like a jellyfish and electrocutes prey.

Hazmats- aliens that disguised themselves as human to trick humans into come out of hiding and/or trap humans together to convert them into aliens. 

Strikers- can sense vibration and can find you if you are not perfectly still. They have mouths that look like an x and they open up and down. They have a chain like tail that can pierce their prey in milliseconds and sharp **** nails. They can also shoot their tongue out at will to capture prey. 

Slizzards- also sense vibration and will bite/sting anything that moves near them. Easy to defeat tho. Small like a salamander but looks like a kimono dragon. 

End of dream always ends the same: it is a scene with a city that’s on fire and the aliens are invading lol. Idk why this has been reoccurring but it’s low key a fun dream verse to enter. Sci-fi is fun. Should I try to draw the monsters from my dreams? ",2024-05-06 02:29:41
790,Dreams,Seeing and hearing things while sleeping,"
Hey y’all,

I’ve been experiencing this for a long time, since im younger (~13 yrs old) and now I’m 21. 
I usually see people or having people talking to me while im sleeping, most of this happen when i try to take a nap. I take a lot of nap but not necessarily because I don’t have enough sleep, i just like napping a lot.

Now, this things happened once in a while and happen more often when i lived with my parents. It’s usually i am able to open my eyes and can’t move, i believe it’s called sleep paralysis.

But there are daysss, i sense people talking to me, about different things but can’t see the face. Or maybe because most time i try to close my eyes so I won’t see anything too scary. This comes with physical feelings as well, something pull on my bedsheet, today i hear the sound like my dog breathing but I haven’t seen her in years. And there’re 2 people above my head try to talk about me and i can hear the conversation,….

Back when i was in high school, i would usually sleep on my side. About 5 mins into my sleep, i would feel like a breathe next to my ears, and then the bed next to me shrink down like someone has just lied on it. Sometimes i will feel like there’s hand on my waist as well, but all of these feelings are very light, unlike the feeling when my family or friend/ real people do it to me.

I used to have sleep paralysis constantly during that time as well, the feeling that you’re awake but you can’t wake up as somethings try to press you down.  Later on, when i talk to my parents about it, we believe it’s supernatural related and got advice to put an old used knife under my pillow. That method works and it’s obvious since one day, my father moved the furniture in my room and took the knife away, I didn’t know and slept like normal, i started to have same thing happened again and have to knock his door to ask him to put it back.

Every time it happens and i got to wake up, i feel like there’s some eyes on me but i try not to think about it as i feel like it only make me more stressed.

I never feel like i will get injured during these experience but they’re all scary and I always try my best not to look at things.

The way I use to get out of it is actively trying to wake myself up and sort of wrestling with the force to get myself out of it and truly feel like im 100% awake. Usually my head will hurt a lot after this.

So far, i have lived a nice life and try to be kind to people, my family is religious but not super religious and i would consider myself as a buddhist, still, I don’t believe i have done anything **** to get involved in a demonic practice. I don’t usually watch horror movie either and not a negative person in life.

These are all truths and i’m willing to explain more if you have any questions.

792,Dreams,Trippiest dream I’ve ever had ,"
Dreamt I was lying in bed. Go to turn on light, light doesn’t work. Bedroom light not working. Figure there’s a fuse issue. Go check fuses. House feels demonic, shifting shadows, new hallways, things I don’t recognize/ get back to fuses, one is out. Fix it, lights working, back to bed. 

Again wake up, lights not working, scary noises coming from somewhere in apartment. Go to fix fuse, this time fuse room is super abnormal. Decorated like old timer classy cigar lounge or something. Ornate Mirrors of various sizes all over the walls, upholstered leather chairs, etc. fix fuse, come out, see the back of a scary gross crackhead looking male hurry into a hallway leading to my back rooms. He has long greasy hair and bad teeth: he’s shorter than me, looks like a rat. Chase him. He’s with another seedy looking portly guy. The vibe is that I’m a ghost and they’re showing my apartment. Try to fight both. Can’t, landing on chin but arms are weak. Realize it’s a dream. Wake up in bed

Gl to try lights. The switch seems to be controlling something outside now. I flick the switch and the streetlight starts flickering and a light outside my window goes on but that’s wrong. Go check fuses again, room is more normal but as I leave I notice boiler is about to explode, it’s hissing and bubbling and the heat reading is way too high. I try to remember if I left the hot water on anywhere and rush to the kitchen: stove is erupting with hot water. Try to call emergency number for property management on fridge. Can’t. Get burned by water. 

Wake up. Try light. Light works. Now typing this. I’m awake. I know I’m awake

793,Dreams,I dreamt of accidentally killing my crush,"As the title said, i dreamt of killing a girl i like or i thought/think i like. I dont know how much backround i need on this but i talked to her for some time and developed some feelings, looked like she did too turned out later she was leading me on and said i took her way too serious. Non the less ignoring that situation overall she’s a pretty good friend, cool to hang out with and just a funny person but this has bothered me a lot. I had a few dreams about her but nothing too extreme like this. 

Me and my bestfriend and her and her bestfriend were on some roof talking when somehow a computer got in my hand like a missile launcher and i started clicking random stuff and i clicked her name and then i teleported off the roof and me and my friend just watched that missile completely getting that building to the ground while she and her friend were on. I wasn’t really emotional in the dream i was just like oh my **** 

Sounds like a **** dream but as soon as i woke up i knew what that meant. Still tried to find it on google but not really this kind of detailed dream of accidentally killing that girl at such a gruesome way, also everything u found on google was way too vague.

If someone can tell me what this means it would be perfect.",2024-05-06 02:03:19

797,Dreams,"My boyfriend died in my dream, what does it mean?","
Hi, I just woke up from a really horrible dream. My boyfriend and I have been together for more than a year now. It’s eithere I don’t have dreams or I don’t remember them most of the time. When I do dream, I am usually aware that I am inside one and am not really bothered.

But this morning I dreamt that my boyfriend died. I don’t really remember everything in detail but what happened was he died when we were, I think, out together or I was the last person he was with before he died in my dream. 

Everything felt real in my dream. Even the surroundings like my house and my bf’s house was exactly the same. From the furnitures to the rooms there was nothing off (from what I remember). Which was probably the reason why I couldn’t distinguish my dream from reality.

I had a call from his aunt, saying that he died. It was like my mind went blank and I couldn’t process it. During the wake/funeral I was silent and just stared at every guest who was weeping and crying. I remember I only sat down at the corner of the room like an empty shell who lost meaning to her life (like literally). I couldn’t even hear all those words of those who tried to comfort me, it was like I was underwater. I wouldn’t even bring myself to eat or drink. I was just staring off at empty air and I understood nothing of what was going on.

For some reason, I began to realize midway that this it was a dream. What happened was we were in my house, together with his parents and mine. Someone from his family probably called a medium or something (idk what they’re called) for us to be able to communicate with him. Suddenly, all of us were able to see him. He looked see-through and was dressed in really good white clothes. 

I don’t remember much but it felt like we were sending him off far away. Everybody was talking to him, crying, and smiling with reassurance that they’d be okay if he wanted to go. I, still sat in one corner of the room and stared at him with empty eyes. I didn’t talk nor stood up from my spot, I still felt empty.

I saw him look at me before he went through a door. I didn’t know what had gotten into me, but I suddenly stood up from my seat and bolted towards that same door. 

Outside it was bright and sunny. I saw him waiting for me like he was expecting me to come after him. I remember I cried so hard that I let all those pent up feelings out. I kneeled in front of him and begged him not to leave me, saying that it was all my fault why he died and I should’ve been the one who died instead of him.

iirc, he tried to reassure and calm me down. There was nothing that could be down to calm me. I looked like a hopeless mess, kneeling on the floor and begging him to stay. 

You know the feeling that you’re almost waking up and the dreams begin to dissolve or fade, that’s what happened.

I just remember the last thing that I said was “How could I live without you?”…And I finally woke up.


I woke up struggling to breathe. I was gasping and tears were falling non-stop from my eyes. I continued to cry for more than 5 minutes up till writing this post.

What does this mean?

These have happened a few times different scenarios each time but always in front of someone. This really scares me as I'm not in a great state mentally and I've had a lot of dark moments. I've lost a lot of people and I've felt lost and alone. I don't know if it has anything to do with the dream but I thought I should've added it. I wake up crying often times when these dreams accure.

Her daughter called me and told me her mother, who was the lady that died, had wanted to see me. i told her that's impossible since she was dead and she told me no, she's not anymore that shes alive again. Well, somehow I found out in my dream she performed the ritual, and i got mad and yelled at her that that was wrong and that she needed to stay dead because she had to rest in peace. I told her I didn't want to see her, and in my dream, I kept running away from both the daughter and mother who died. Any ideas what this dream could mean?",2024-05-05 23:45:51

Him and I have never dated I had feelings for him and they occasionally come out. We had hung out the night before and he stayed the night at my place. I do not remember it crazy well but I remember we were at the church and I ran up to her told her something and she left crying later when they were on the alter I ran up to him and I told him how much I loved him and we left together.

802,Dreams,"False Awakenings/ Different Realties, maybe??","Okay, so let me just start with stating that this is my first Reddit post ever 🤧.
So like a day ago, I experienced what seems to be false awakenings. And multiple in a row in the same sleep span, okay? 😃
 [So tbh it scares me and I just want to say that I’m associating it with different realities for some reason because that’s the feel I get. Maybe it has nothing to do with different realities or what not but It kinda feels like it 🤷🏻‍♀️.]
So it was about 2am when I was able to fall asleep after a going out to the beach at night and I was pretty tired. 🫡
[Tbh I’ve dealt with depression for a while now so I think it has something to do with my mental health possibly 🥲] 
Anyway, I go to sleep and then I randomly wake up.. and I’m like dizzy and I’m like out of breath and it’s a complete different house from the one I live in now with my siblings and my mom. I still have the same consciousness as I do in my actual life⁉️(this one) and I hear someone tell me “are you okay?!” And I’m like barely spewing words out and like out of breath and I go “no.. not really… i don’t know what’s… wrong with me..  I feel very weird…”everything’s just blurry and the person who asked if I was okay seemed to be my mom? But Its actually a woman that I’ve never seen in my actual life.. I’m Hispanic and this woman is blonde and I’m so confused and I ask her “who… are you😦?” And she says something but at this point I’m passing out and couldn’t make the words out 🫠. So I end up (passing out) and I wake up and there’s doctors hovering over me trying to get my attention but everything’s so blurry. I can tell they have me in a hospital bed running down a corridor, like the lights are passing by and stuff and there’s an oxygen tube on me. They have the light blue uniform the head cap and a mask on. I was so confused because who are these people?? 😟 This isn’t my usual life… Hello?! 😨.. so I try to get words out but I gasp and pass out once again 😑. Then I wake up and it’s pitch black so I’m thinking.. ‘oh, our lights must’ve gone out or something 🤔’ but then I feel a presence nearby and it’s cold and I know I’m having sleep paralysis but I could move so it was a dream🫥.. I feel as the presence grabs my right leg as I try to stand up, I grasp onto my headboard quickly and try to keep myself on my bed but it lifts me and I feel my body being upside down and then it just starts violently flipping me around like a rag😵‍💫. This terrified me and so I start praying to ****. 😓
[Yes I’m religious, I recently got back into Christianity]
So then I wake up again… and I can tell this one is real, finally.
 [This really terrifies me because I’ve had another sleep experience where I woke up in another “reality”]
So, I was driving a white van (eheh.. creepy I know 😝🍭). It was also in one of those tunnels with the orangeish lights where cars go through when you’re headed to like a city or something but anyway; one of my exes was in the back passed out (ew like why 🤨-) and his friend was sitting like with his back against the door of the car but he was awake. Then, I start to feel dizzy here, like a **** type of dizzy. And so my ex is randomly in the passenger seat now and asks me “are you okay??” And I’m like “no, take the wheel ima pull over” so I pull over and we end up taking a pause but somehow we don’t see any other cars which is just weird. 🧐
[At least I don’t remember them]
But anyway my ex starts to ask me “what’s wrong with you? And slapping me awake.  And I’m like “I don’t know, everything feels weird man, I think ima nap” but I end up actually passing out while attempting to lay down like in the back part of the van which seemed to have the seats missing, so there was a lot of room. I just collapse. And I wake up in my bed but I’m on my stomach so I just feel as something gets on my back. (just great 🙂)
[Mind you sleep paralysis is really common for me and it’s always this one presence and she does the same thing]
So, I feel her quickly get on my back and just hover her face over mine to check if I’m awake. If I’m not she will violently shake my bed to wake me up. 😖
[This happens on random days] 
She always ends up hugging me too and kinda of like spooning me. (I know it’s weird 😐) it really terrifies me and I always pray to **** when this happens now. 
[Only reason I know it’s a she is because I’ve seen her once at my grandmas house and that was the only time I “saw” her. She kinda looks like a mix of the girl from the ring and the grudge. White dress and everything, pale white/blueish skin] (ERM- 😅)
So when I was at my grandma’s sleeping over in the living room couch one time and I woke up and turn around to face the way where the hallway was. And I just see something standing in the hall, I try to fix my eyes on it and I realize it’s some sort of entity so I just go “nah, I don’t have time for this, leave me alone I’m trying to sleep😒” and like I NEVER actually would, I turn my back to it and face the way I originally was in and fall asleep. 
[that took me a lot of courage to do, or maybe I was too tired] ✋🏼🙂‍↕️
But yeah, that’s how I know what she looks like. And this whole experience just weirds me out and I don’t get why I keep waking up in dreams and feeling like I’m so confused and that my life’s a lie and that I’m actually living in different realities simultaneously 😣.. someone please share if you know why this happens or if you’ve had a similar experience. 
Thanks for reading this 🙏🏼. **** bless you and to those out there who have ever experienced this, I really pray you don’t EVER. It’s terrifying. 🙁

809,Dreams,A meme song in a dream,"It’s hard to explain though text but I wanna write this down before I forget. 


The song went like this 
“You say somethig, then I say something, then you say something, then I say something,then you something, then I say something back ,then we repeat that” 

and as the song goes on the end line gets more and more aggressive so 
“And then you best believe we repeat that” 
“YOUR NOT GONNA BELEVE WE REPEAT THAT” 
“Then you say nothing back BUT I SAY SOMETHING….” 

So in theory this song can go on forever but you can change the last line each time and obviously add some “you’re not gonna fu-£/);@;&amp; believe, we repeat that” 
But what was fun about it is you could do it to any turn that works so it was just a song that would start and the person who started could continue it forever if they wanted and it was just to annoy the **** out of people around you because it was kinda catchy so this endless song would get stuck in people’s heads.

812,Dreams,Years long reoccurring nightmare,"Hi all,

First time posting here and since I just woke up from this same dream thought I'd post it and gain insight. 

So for as long as I can remember I've been having the same dream at least 2 or 3 times a week. It's always the same, I'm in my house or in my bed, and then someone will begin shooting me. I never see their face but I feel every bullet enter my body. I can feel the pain of each bullet ripping apart my organs and I feel myself dying. I always wake up in a panic and I can hardly breathe. It takes me days to feel safe enough to sleep in my room. I often sleep in the living room with my cats or I call my friend who works nights to try to calm down and go back to sleep. 

Can anyone help explain why this happens or tell me ways to stop this reoccurring nightmare. Outside of this I don't really dream or have dreams. It's always this one and I don't like it lol. ",2024-05-05 21:40:55
813,Dreams,I don’t know what this means.,"I am not well versed in sleep paralysis and what counts and does not count, but I can’t figure out what is happening. I truthfully haven’t delved deep into research or anything, but after a couple of quick google searches I decided it’d be best to ask someone with experience. I do not intend to be spiritual with any suggestions in this post, I just want a rational explanation because I am scared out of my wits rn. 

 I woke up from a mishmash of dreams. I’d only been asleep for an hour and a half at most, but I had a thought in the dream of a prior experience because I spotted something familiar. My mother passed Christmas 2023 and for months after I felt as if I was being haunted but not by her. Obviously this wasn’t the case, but I had reoccurring dreams where I was in my room and couldn’t wake up. I could move up, or try to, but my eyes would close again and I’d be laying down on my back again. It felt as if I was experiencing a lag of sorts. In these dreams I’d see horrible things around my room, typically feminine figures. In my dreams I’d see them too. The worst ones were when I’d see one in my room, dripping wet (my mother had drowned) and when they’d inch closer and closer. I realised this is likely stemmed from grief, but it came back almost a year and a half later after a long interval and I am scared.

 Tonight I woke up from my dream and had not yet opened my eyes, but felt a gust of wind that gradually picked up and became a strong gust. I felt it across my face and over my arms, and I tried to heave up off of my bed but realised I couldn’t. I would move up, and find myself back down. After too many attempts to count, my eyes were closed again. I felt my cat, who’d been sleeping on the bed, licking my lips. (I had a horrible feeling it wasn’t my cat but I’m pushing past that because I know none of it’s real and don’t want to entertain that thought.) I heard my phone vibrating like mad and felt it. I woke up again after seeing odd visions of my cat on top of me and felt as if my heart had stopped. I looked to my cat, who hadn’t moved. He was still sat on the bed, staring at me.

 I thought it was over it it wasn’t. I tried to move but was forced back down again, that same feeling of lag. I was beginning to panic and for some sense of reality grabbed my cat, who I was able to hold onto. He obviously didn’t like this sudden grab and struggled against me, but I didn’t let him go. I looked in the corner, where my cello was, and saw a woman. She was coming out of the wall, had long dark hair, and a centipede or snake like body. I was terrified and screamed, which finally woke me up.

My cat still hadn’t moved and I haven’t moved either. I’m petrified. I was almost tempted to run and sleep with my dad but I’m 18 and to be honest, I am now terrified of the dark corridor outside.

I don’t really know what to do and don’t want these nightmares to come back because I have been doing better than ever.",2024-05-05 21:26:28
814,Dreams,"Dream of collecting dirty money, and I woke up feeling and hearing stuff in my ear.","In the the dream, I was picking up dirty dollar bills off of the ground. I realistically felt them in my hand when I picked them up. They were all $1 bills.

For some reason, there was these litter boxes (with 💩 and garbage mixed in them) with some dollars bills them, I left those in there, especially since it was only a few $1 bills anyway.

I was outside some kind of bank, and went in to try to exchange the dirty money for bigger (and clean) bills, but they refused. Not because the money was dirty, but because I didn’t have an account there.

Then I found myself in my room, and there was this weird setup in the wall next to my closet. It was like part of the wall had an internal shelf in the wall, and my (well, a smaller one) TV was in it, and my Nintendo Switch. The Switch was on/in this metal shelf thing that slid in and out, and I was struggling to make a cable plug through a slot in it to plug into the Switch.

Also (I THINK before the money/bank part) I was in some, like warehouse/back of a store kind of room (pretty sure I’ve been there before in other dreams) with computers.

I was trying to ex out of **** and clear the browser trying to do so without someone behind me seeing that it was ****. (I watched **** before I went to sleep, and, you know…..).

When I woke up I heard all this popping and cracking in my left ear. THAT WAS REAL. I held my nose closed and blew to pop my ears, but only my right ear popped, nothing happened with my left ear.

I even felt some, like eardrum pressure changing during the day (and right how, although blowing actually worked and then yawning made it pop).

I can’t help but think my ear doing that was supernatural/paranormal, but other things make me think that I’m experiencing that type of stuff……

Why can’t I ever dream of Jesus. I’ve seen demons and stuff like that in my dreams multiple times, I maybe saw Jesus one time before, but He definitely wasn’t as vivid, clear, and realistic looking and feeling as the evil spirits usually are.

Even these dreams that aren’t actual nightmares tend to feel uncomfortable, so vivid, realistic, uncanny…..",2024-05-05 21:17:20
815,Dreams,3rd time dreaming an ex from 2001,"I had a dream with this ex in it, after the first time in 2022 I thought maybe it was a sign as I have been single since 2013 and in the dream he was letting it be understood we were going to get married. I tried to reach out but never got a reply.
After the second dream in 2023 I thought maybe it's just my brain trying to get back to a mental place of comfort since I was trying to reach the place he was in. This last time it was pure **** and nothing else so I am thinking maybe it's just I would have expected him to be like that if we ever met again...but truthfully I think he's married or he would have replied after I tried to reach out.

816,Dreams,Has anyone else ever problem-solved in dreams based off of previous dreams?,"First off, I wanna start by saying that I am a very active dreamer and I dream almost every single day. Also, in many of my dreams I have remembered places I had been to in other dreams (a neighbor's house, a park, a school, etc.).

So, a couple years ago I had dreams where I was at my house and started running away from someone. In the beginning of when I began getting these dreams, I would always turn right down my complex and hide in the behind the bushes by the side of my house. This used to work, but eventually I began getting caught the more I ran down this way. I remember, one time, I was in my dream and I was playing hide and seek with my brother for some reason and ran outside my house to hide. When I did this, I remember thinking to myself in my dream that whenever I take a right and hide behind the bushes, I always get caught, so this dream, I decided to take a left. This kind of worked, because I wasn't found by my brother in my dream, but I was found by my mother who said, ""You're not allowed to hide outside the house."" In a couple other dreams I've had I've gone out of the complex to a nearby neighborhood to also evade.

I haven't gotten a dream like this one in a little while, but I still remember places and often take similar routes. Has anyone else ever done this?",2024-05-05 20:24:18

Then in this dream I decided to take myself and my dog away, in which my mom replied “you know how much this stuff means to me.” She was crying and very upset and I felt bad leaving but I couldn’t stay in that house. I told her the house looked horrible and scary. My friends took my dog in a car with other dogs to there grandmas house and I left after to go there for my dog, but then put in the wrong address and became super late and they were texting me rushing me.

820,Dreams,The Messenger Dream,"Hello everyone, I'm Gorkem. I had a very interesting dream last night and I want to tell everyone. First of all, I had a Lucid dream. I was aware of what I was doing, I jumped, I flew slightly, etc... Then my consciousness went away and I went back to the normal dream. I had a great peace inside me. (I had misunderstandings with my family, especially with my father. I was very angry with him, but now I interpreted these events and I understood. My anger is gone, most of the things in my head are cleared. But there are still things I haven't talked about and I'm looking for time to talk about them.) Towards the end of the dream I was saying goodbye to my father. There was a great peace in me, but there was also pain, as if my father had died and I was saying goodbye to his soul. Then suddenly 3 side by side pyramids came in front of me and there was 1 star on each of them. These stars got bigger and bigger and bigger and covered the whole sky and it was white and then I woke up. After I woke up I started crying (because of my regrets and fear of losing...). So what do you think? After that I searched the internet and typed in the constellation of Orion and the pyramids and there were pictures of exactly what I saw. And no, I haven't searched for such things recently, I haven't seen pictures etc. What I saw was like the picture below:

821,Dreams,Lost my child in a dream ,"Last night I had one of the most heartbreaking dreams I ever had before. For context I normally had very vivid unsettling dreams and even nightmares that often linger in my day. This one has been stuck with me for longer for a different reason: My dream son was taken from me. 

I dreamed me and my partner had a son. Neither of us  want kids in real life. So it was odd I had a newborn son in my dream. His name is Warren. He has my eyes. He giggled Everytime I came into the room. my dream didn't have too much of a plot at first. It was mostly me and my partner looking after the baby. I even remember a scene where I was still laying down in bed, and my partner went to comfort the baby and then me. We had two little dream cats too, one orange and one black, they loved the baby too. They would sniff the baby as my partner would hold him, and the baby would giggle. I remember in my dream he giggled a lot. 

Then more happened. I guess the plot kicked in. Somehow, until this end, I didn't know me and my partner had superpowers and were part of some superhero agency ****. I could fly, my partner would do spiderman stuff. We were called to a ship quickly and I remembered putting Warren in his little baby carrier. He never made it on the ship. I remember asking my partner ""Where is the baby?"" I won't forget how vivid their face looked. How shocked. 

I guess I told all the other superheroes and they blew me off a bit. They said there was a major supervillain attack. We would find my baby when we could. I suggested if the anti-hero(an anti-hero/villain in a price of media me and my partner watch in real life)had my baby, but no one replied seriously. I felt so heartbroken. I told myself I would hunt down the anti-hero and find my baby. 

I felt the pain of missing him when I woke up. I told my partner. I brought it up once more later in the day, they told me I shouldn't hang on this dream anymore, but I miss my baby. I still see him smiling. I miss you Warren. I hope I see you again.

823,Dreams,Movie about boy with talent for making artisanal meals out of live animals…,"To summarize, it looked and felt like an early 90’s big budget movie trailer about a boy struggling with society’s feeling towards him carving meat off of living animals like a gyro to make artisanal meals. Evidently, the story is about the boy’s decline into madness as he develops a preference to consume the meat raw. I was treated to a first person perspective of him consuming a **** of flesh still attached to the face of a living creature.

For unknown reasons the boy and at least two other people end up on a ship transporting livestock… During a very severe storm, a confrontation between the trio and possibly the crew erupts; this is when the ship begins to sink and everyone in that confrontation begins to panic. Impulsively, the boy opens a porthole and almost immediately the area is flooded. The porthole is too small for the boy squeeze out of, so he drowns…

This figure was about my height and looked like one of my classmates but it had a slender man-like face to it. The only thing that made it different was that it had a mouth. Aside from that, I saw may cat coming towards me so I waited, still watching the figure next to me. When my cat finally came to me, he threw up a **** mole rat. Then the figure beside stood up. I then grabbed my cat and started running back into the school screaming for help. While I was running I saw the same human like creatures in the school.

830,Dreams,I've been dreaming like Sisyphus,"Hello lovely people!

I've been dreaming about a recurring format in my dreams. In the dreams I am givin a task or objective that I am supposed to complete, and every time I fail in a new way. 
In the most recent one: Me and a group of friends wander into a paradise world by day but by night it turns in an evil shadow world. There is a clear goal, get to the other side of the river. We try various ways of escaping but all end in failure. Sometimes someone died and it's my fault, I die, we get recaptured, or we make it but it is still somehow a failure. 

Live, Die, Repeat, Live, Die, Repeat, Live, Die, Repeat.
Every night the dreams change. Sometimes I'm by myself trying to deliver something across town, or I can't make a decision, or I'm trying to **** Dracula and escape their castle (In one ending, Dracula was my father) 

The location is never the same, the task are never the same the people are never the same (except for myself) It usually ends in death and the dream always keeps resetting. Sometimes I can use the information from the last attempt, but nothing changes except for another gruesome death.

I am getting really tired of these. The only nights when I don't have the recurring nightmares is the nights I either don't remember my dreams or I don't dream.",2024-05-05 16:11:37
831,Dreams,Dreaming of dead relative,"Hi everyone,  I'm hoping someone could help interpret this dream or give an insight.

For context, my great-grandmother passed away when I was 14 (currently 31). 
In this dream I go to her apartment (she never lived here in real life, it's a random apartment) to visit her. She tells me to let myself in, which I do, and she then opens the door to the bathroom and she comes out real quick telling me to wait that she will be right out, and then goes back in and closes the bathroom door. 

Now, this isn't the first time I've dreamt with her since her passing, so that's not the part that confuses me. It is actually how the front door was. 
When she closes the bathroom door, I hear what sounds like someone trying to get into the apartment. When I go to the front door to double check it's locked, the door is not closed all the way but yet it is locked and won't open. The same thing happened when I had arrived, yet managed to get it open.

834,Dreams,"Dream diary day 2: Most hilarious dream ever, woke up laughing.","Welcome to day two of my dream diary.
Because I only just started, I have quite some catching up to do, so today I'll share my favourite dream. No, I wasn't on acid or any other sort of drug, I swear.

Alright so, the dream:

My fiancé (let's call him Harry) and I were walking in some sort of park, and we walked past this gate that was guarded by some FBI looking guy. We heard some people talking about lost episodes of Arrested Development as the FBI guy opened the gate for them and they walked in.
Harry and I were like ""Omg! Did you hear that? More Arrested Development episodes!?"". Harry gave me a knowing smile and took my hand, guiding me towards the gate that still hadn't closed, and we snuck in.
I was all nervous and surprised, whispering to Harry: ""Is this even legal? Won't we get in trouble?"" And Harry was all like ""Nooo, don't worry. Watch!"" And he walked up to the FBI guy, super casual, ""Hey this is cool, right? As long as we don't touch anything?"" And the FBI guy was all fine with it, joking around about calling Harry's mom (Harry is a grown **** man) if he'd find out we did something wrong.

So, anyway, we continued following this path, which lead us to this huge S.H.I.E.L.D. looking building. I don't remember much about that building, I just know that we entered the front and left through the back, which lead us to the most hilarious part of the dream.

We exited the building, walking into a wide, bright looking field. In the distance, I could see  a large body of water. Above the water, in the sky, we could see ghosts/spirits floating towards the field, carrying DVD boxes, and it made sooo much sense in my mind. I was like ""Omg, ofcourse! So that's how shows and movies are made! Duh! This is where the lost Arrested Development episodes must be!""
I walked closer and saw two figures standing on the waterfront.
It were none other than... wait for it... Pikachu and Pichu. Bright, cartoony colours and everything. Pikachu had a notepad which he used to write down all the shows and movies that the spirits brought in.
I looked to my side, highly amused, wanting to see Harry's reaction, but before I knew it Harry had turned into a Pichu as well (which made all the sense in the world at the time) and ran over to Pikachu, telling him how much he loved Japan and Anime (those aren't things he's all that interested in, in real life).

I woke up laughing. Best dream ever.

Edit: We never found those lost episodes, unfortunately.",2024-05-05 15:12:09
835,Dreams,Reaccurring nightmare got me thinking and I want to analyse it,"I had this dream a couple of times but always forgot about it. At least until last friday when I had it again after a long time. And I want to analyse it mostly because I usually get a brief moment of lucid dreaming to snap out of the situation and change the dream. But this time I was ""trapped"" until I woke up. This will e a loooong post.

The dream starts with me having a ""normal"" day in that dream. Its not a normal day though I feel sick and dizzy like something is severly wrong. I don't know the region its supposed to simulate. The gras is dead and brow, there is a lot of hills but no trees, no forest or houses. Just one path after another and some benches. People walk it up and down. Im with a person but I don't know them IRL.  
Slowly but surely I start to hallucinate. The person asks what is wrong and I tell them ""I'm hallucinating again, the wardrobes are spawning every now and then.""  
There are two wardrobes. One is white and a square like form. The doors are a little like western saloon doors but no fancy shape, just the stripes. The wardrobe is very modern. Purely white and shiny and the form has no extra design poking out. Its also supposed to be mounted on a wall so it flies above the ground.  
The other is older. Dark wood and many decorations are carved into it. Its a rectangle, tall and standing on the ground. But still in a good condition. Its the one that will become important later again, the other will only appear in this part of the dream.

After that the scene changes. Im suddenly in a house that is a single room with my mother next to me. In the room are mostly small children playing with each other. We are sitting on a bench that is higher elevated then the children. Next to us are two other adults.  
We can also look outside to a small playground. Im just talking to my mother when the dream becomes very violent and the true nightmare part beginns, its also very confusing. So I will censor it if you want to skip it.  
&gt;!It starts with a plane that comes crashing down from the sky in a mountain. Somehow a quad falls out of it. Its on and while spinning and falling, it catches one child from the playground that is now stuck in it and after that the other 2 are killed before the quad crashes into the building. Thats the moment I turn around and hug my mother, trying to persue her not to look. But she does.
The other two adults step down, wanting to stop the masacare but are killed too. I can hear the screams until they die down.!&lt;

After that my mother is terrified but I urge her to come with me and say something like ""We have to move, it will beginn!""  
So we run into the first of 8 stages to get out of the dream. But I know that I have only ever gotten to 3 of those stages. Usually I die before I get past stage 3. Its also the only dream I am actually capable of dying too. Usually I become a ghost, get revived or just survive whatever happend. Not in this dream. In all stages we have to find the old wardrobe and the person by my side needs to take the item inside it.

Stage 1 is with my mother. We rush past small and tight streets. The streets are wet and the walls have a dark green tint from moss. In my dream I knew it was a city but the houses had no windows and we couldn't look up because the walls were so high and the sky so dark from the rain.  
Behind us is a humanoid creature. The stature is similar to auntie ethel from Baldurs Gate 3 if you know her but the creature can not talk and only make sounds. Its representing a woman. Her eyes are fully dark and she has a teethless big smile that goes from ear to ear.  
There is one moment that I get close to it and we both stop and look at each other but after that its back to running until my mother and I found the wardrobe. Once she opens it there a cooking set. Pans and Pots. She grabs a pan and this section of the dream ends and Im on my way to the next stage (Literally walking to a castle through a city).  
The interesting part of this is that my mother only cooked for me and my siblings, when we were small children. My farther took over and I can't remember my mother cooking at all. Also this time she has been leading the way. Whenever i had the dream before I was the one running infront of her.

Stage 2 is in a castle. Suddenly there is my sister and her roomate (But I think when I had the dream when I was younger they were different people) and my brother. My mother is also at my side.  
It starts with me waking up in the castle in a room with said people. Im still incredibly terrified from stage 1 and woke up with a panic attack because 2 serventans, one male, one femals, enter the room to get us to dinner. We go through the castle. The walls are made of pure glas and the stone is a very light grey. I like the place but I know what will come next.  
We will meet ""The whisper king"". Yes he even had an english name in my dream, even though the rest of the dream is in my native language german. The whisper king hates any kind of loud noises. So we can only whisper and whenever we even raise our voice a little bit we are sssh, by the servants. But a big issue is that the glas door of the castle creek. And they are loud.  
We meet the whisper king in his dining room. build like a very small square arena. The king is sitting in the middle of the bottom. I sit next on his table. The other 4 people take places on the seats above us, mostly watching as we just talk. The king also played classical piano music in this room to calm himself down. But that was the moment I woke up this time. Simply because of sheer axiety since I knew that one of us would be loud and he would transform into a monster and a chase to the next wardrobe would ensue. I believe I would either take my brother or sister to the wardrobe for their item, but I'm not sure what will be inside.

The whisper king is what is the most interesting to me as I can kind of see myself in him? The whole castle asthetic is something I like. Big rooms, big glas walls and windows, there is a lot of light everywhere, playing classic piano to calm down (its my favourite genre and plays every night while I sleep, but the songs were none of my playlist), being bothered by loud noises, especially the high pitched ones like the queeking doors.

I can't remember stage 3. I just know I had the dream before and have been to that stage before.

Any help untangeling the mess is appreciated. Especially the wardrobes and the whisper king ""bother"" me. ",2024-05-05 15:07:57

837,Dreams,Reccurring dreams causing relationship issues,"I keep having this reoccurring nightmare where I'm being attacked by someone (probably my dad or older brother)

She said I shout so loud that the whole house is wakened up. But I don't remember any of it. What should I do?l 

It happens when I'm asleep so i have no control over it. But it’s bren going on at least once a week for the past year. 

She first told me about last Spring. A year ago today. That's why I'm worried. 

It’s probably been going on for years. And the thought of me disturbing everyone around me for years now frightens me.

I think it's because when I was a kid, I was bullied and beaten everyday by my dad, older brother, neighbours and classmates. I think it's caused serious childhood trauma. Repressed trauma which I never knew about until today. I'm not an emotional man. I never laugh or cry. So the fact that I become a mad man when I sleep is alarming. 

Now I'm just unsure about what to do. Or how to deal with. Ya know?

842,Dreams,Dream Highlights,"I was able to write down the first thing I dreamt about. Then went back to sleep. I had a few other dream segments. They came out pretty lucid. I'm now starting to remember a dream I had of my old best friend.

In the dream, I was looking through drink and pudding mixes. I'm sure I forgot some of them. I immediately tried to memorize them when I woke up, forgetting some because it was such a vivid dream. There were several pudding mixes I was looking at. And because I could've added milk or water to them, which could create more recipes that my brain could comprehend. I took notice of a box of pumpkin with pistachio jello instant pudding, seeing a victorian 'm' on the front. Strawberry mix, which I put into some bread pudding. There was a pastel green mix too, that looked like lucky charms. I can't remember what the mix was from. Or if it even was a drink mix. The other thing was a cream tea. It was turning into cream tea, because I was adding milk to it. Audio from hannah montana was playing through my head, leading into my next dream. I'm pretty sure it was the next dream and not the first one. I was now in algebra class. I didn't take any notes from yesterday or days ago, seeing the font words on the smartboard. 'notes' and something else. The few papers I had had notes written down on it, but not the actual assignment. I missed the notes that I needed for today's class. I had no work done on my paper. I did this in real life sometimes. I contemplating asking my sweet teacher for the notes but I felt intimidated to do so. Even though he's not a harsh/strict or stern guy at all. I was digging through my bookbag, looking through stuff I took from home. A flying insect flew out from my bag, flying through the air. The girl across the room who was staring at me noticed it, very annoyed or uncomfortable by it's presence. More disgusted by me. There was something pink and important I saw in my bag that I can't remember. It connected to that other dream. I assume the strawberry mix, or maybe it was strawberry wafers. I looked down at myself and saw I was wearing black cargo pants. Probably had a babytee on. After this, I woke up in my living room. I was crying, thinking about how much I miss algebra class/school. So this must take place in the present/current age. It was dark in the room, nighttime. The app for youtube was on the tv. I saw a thumbnail with my partner on it, breaking me out of my tears and sadness. It felt like a light came over me. 

Other thumbnails showed felix and peter pan from ouat; videos that I watched more than 10 years ago now. I scrolled through them, then clicked on netflix. I hate netflix and their hypersexual movies, neverending supernatural genres. I turned on a series that looked interesting. It was about a couple. Which I would never click on, since that's a giveaway something's gonna have **** in it, and it makes me uncomfortable or bored. I like nerdy **** or action movies. I didn't like disney much as an kid. I watched the show as if I was actually conscious and awake, it was so vivid. The intro faded in black, couple laying together; the camera closed on on their faces. They probably were kissing. It implied an afterglow or after ****. They were laughing happily. The girl revealed to the guy that she was bisexual, which ended up **** him off. He became possessive and a stalker. I feel as if this wasn't a dream but it was; a girl with blunt bangs cut her bangs more. I don't think it was something I saw while awake. A brazillian mom then stood outside the door to her husband's bedroom, hearing moaning from a woman. She closed it. There was hurt in her eyes. I knew that he was cheating on her/she caught him cheating. ",2024-05-05 13:24:40
843,Dreams,I had a dream with specific numbers,"Part 1: I was at a party? (not sure what it was) and I seen T sitting down at a table with a few other people I knew so I went over there. (THEY WERE **** AS ****) We were talking for a minute and T said who wanna smash (😀) i jokingly said me and her **** dragged me to a room and idk what happened specifically but I think it was fun- then I woke up.

Part 2: when I went back to sleep we were at this festival thing with food so me and T were getting some food , I had *$27.63* so I could pay for it. Well someone yelled “ALL BABY MAMAS START FIGHTING EACH OTHER” and apparently there was a LOT of baby mamas so I started walking the opposite way to not get caught in the mess but T stayed and started beating people lol. Later we were trying to figure out how we would pay the people back for that good **** chicken so we while were trying to think of ways I was dreaming inside a dream ****. That dream was really clear and it was about me asking T out and us being together.. then my phone started ringing. I answered, it was a friend from somewhere and when I answered it played a girl in red song……….. she was into me but I was into someone else….. then I woke up.

844,Dreams,Meaning of being forced to kill a child in dream,"So this kid (maybe 8-10) was trying to **** me, and he was searching for a gun in the house to shoot me with. He said as soon as he found the gun he was gonna blow my brains out. I knew he was serious. I had a big axe in my hands and once he grabbed the gun off the counter I knew what I had to do to stay alive, I swung the axe at him and it got gory, it was so realistic that I almost threw up after waking up, first I dismembered the arm with the weapon in it, and then I kept swinging at his head until he stopped moving. I feel like a **** psychopath and I would never do something like that even if I knew they were going to **** me. But I want to know if there’s any meaning to this dream",2024-05-05 13:13:47
845,Dreams,Teeth... Shedding?,"So, Im no stranger to the ""Teeth Falling Out"" dream. Not by any means. But last night, (or this morning?) I had the usual feeling of my teeth being alien in my mouth, so I helped them along because it was annoying me, and then, suddenly, there are these soft tooth shaped masses in my mouth. Over the rest of the dream they slowly hardened and became actual teeth again that didnt feel alien to me.

In case it matters, the rest of the dream was about my best friend getting a gf. I was really proud of him because she seemed like a really cool girl! We went to various wacky locations during the dream, the specifics have gotten away from me though.

So, one simple question: ****?",2024-05-05 13:11:56

But somehow I managed to get out of the car, albeit easily, and use my phone to call emergency services.
But somehow my car started to feel lighter and started floating and bobbing to a grass bank nearby and I remembered a old lady coming forward to grant my arm and pull me out along with the car

850,Dreams,A strange dream I had last night.,"I had a dream last night, that took place in some large hotel-esque building. I was chilling around, but in the background there was almost this anime like plot of some teenage girl who had a cursed friend or room mate, though most of the details of that escape me. Then I was walked in a hallway with many classrooms, and went into one. There was an old lady teacher and her students, elementary age. She told me ""you have no place here"" or something like that, to which I responded ""I'm just dropping by to thank you for everything you've done"". The teacher's name was Ms. Meg. I do not recall ever having such a teacher in real life. As I left the classroom, I quickly caught a glimpse of the opening to the 1998 Godzilla playing on a projector. Then the part of the dream that stood out to me the most, was when I went to the aquarium. It was probably a freshwater tank, since the sediment at the bottom and the brownish hue of the water were reminiscent of a lake or slow moving river. Yet in the tank was an interesting combination of creatures. There was lampreys, sturgeons, a nurse shark, an octopus, several giant centipedes, and an atlas beetle chilling on the bottom. Yeah. Also, somewhere in the dream my dad personally knew Walter White, so that's also weird.

Could this have any meaning?",2024-05-05 12:09:26

852,Dreams,I had a weird ass dream involving a school friend and running from the cops,"So I had a weird **** dream where my school friend stole her dad’s car and I was in the back seat, and she was joyriding around on highways which were on and around mountains. But for some reason she was driving very badly and drove into oncoming traffic before crashing into a car. That was the only part of the dream she was in. Then I was eating lunch with my dad at a local outdoor shopping center, when sheriff’s deputies arrived in a crown vic to arrest me, my dad then wanted to come with me so I would know my rights??? But the cops took off with me in the back of the car before he could get in with me. Then I teleported back to the shopping center and I started walking home, but then went to my friend/neighbors house. But he wasn’t home so I just walked around in his house before continuing home. There were multiple cop cars outside my house, and a van with a K9. I then surrendered to them and got teleported back to the shopping center, and tried walking home again. Then a motorcycle cop saw and recognized me, and then he started shooting at me. I then was teleported back to the center again, and was in a guitar center (which doesn’t exist in the actual shopping center) I was then found by a nice sheriff??? Who dropped me off at school so I could eat lunch before they booked me??? I then woke up and saw that I had overslept by a whole **** hour…",2024-05-05 11:57:13
853,Dreams,Dreamt I was sent to Hell,"Last night I dreamt that I had died and was sent to ****. I remember walking around for the first part of the dream in a mostly A-typical desolate fire and brimstone, red- brown -orange, lava, boulders and sand landscape. I could hear screams and crying from all around me but couldn’t see where it was coming from.

After wondering around cautiously for a while I finally came across someone else, a former friend who was super nasty and unpleasant right from the get go and then within 5 min of conversation about how we got both ended up in ****, he was babbling hysterical nonsense and I had to literally run away afraid for my life. Then I ran into someone else, same thing, then another same thing. It kept happening with different people I had met throughout my lifetime. All of them were people I had lost touch with over the years.

I remember walking alone after a few of these encounters and either asking myself out loud why I ended up here. I live a mostly good and honest life, try to provide as best I can for my wife and children and keep to myself. I don’t steal, I don’t lie or cheat or gamble  do anything that would make me end up in a place like this.

Then a voice spoke to me almost telepathically that was so loud it was almost deafening and said that  I had ended up in **** because I refused forgiveness in my life. I never forgave those who hurt me (which is true) and I cannot make it into heaven without forgiveness in my heart.

The voice not only terrified me but it sounded almost alien …yet familiar like a voice I had heard before but with a filter on it or something like that. I shouted out loud to stop, denying that was a valid reason for someone to be sentenced to ****.

I ran as far as I could before I saw what appeared to be some sort of **** like hole in the rock walls ahead of me. I saw others clambering over each other to squeeze into the **** like cavity telling it was an exit and a the only way out. 

I was freaking out. How could I be certain this was an exit? Maybe it was trap or some kind of test and I’d end up further into ****? But what was the alternative? Stay in this level of **** forever? No way I thought.

I squeezed my way through the **** terrified but determined to escape where I was. I remember a bright light as I pushed through but I didn’t feel like heaven.

Then I woke up. Sweating and hyperventilating. I couldn’t go back to sleep after that.

I’m not a religious person nor have I had religious dreams before. I mostly identify as agnostic. 

That being said there no denying the message that came through. I’m going to try to work on forgiveness.

I’ll remember this dream for the rest of my life.

858,Dreams,I was warned not to tamper with old street signs,"I was in some weird park, wandering around. Everything was too neat, too perfect, and the more I looked around the more artificial the place looked.

Everything was all sectioned out, with each area of concrete being mostly one or two colors.

I walked into an area that was all beachy colors, pinks and sands and some bright neon stuff.

I walked over to a street sign that looked out of place. It was dark brown, black, and an **** mix of textures. It was *wrong*.

I reached out to try and read it, and the girl of my dreams (yes she's in almost all my dreams, no she's not real) ran towards me from out of sight, and forces my hand away from the sign.

She moved so fast that she was a blur. She hugged me really tight and spoke really quietly. ""No, (my real name) honey. Don't touch those. The ancients really don't like it when someone messes with their street signs.""

She wasn't kidding. There was no plant life within 3 ft of that sign except grass, and a rat skeleton on the ground under it.",2024-05-05 11:21:37
859,Dreams,Dreams of a disappearing woman twice in my home town during visits to my sister: ,"More like reoccurring themes rather than a specific dream. Both times I’ve been to my home town this year I’ve had dreams of me and a friend, who also lives there, being told of a woman who disappeared for no reason. In this dream, it’s pretty choppy, so I can’t tell you in detail, but we were being told about a woman who was walking on the side of the road who disappeared out of thin air, seemingly. A person going by noticed she looked rough and tired and dirty and was going to offer her a ride when she just vanished from the Road. We were being shown pictures and little Nick knacks that were sitting in little wooden cubbyholes on a giant shelf that she was constructing in her barn on her farm. I don’t know who the person was that was talking to us just that he was somehow involved with the woman before. The whole dream was really strange and eerie and since I woke up shortly after I got a chance to explore the shelf it felt like the middle of a longer dream. 

The last time I was in my home town, was several months before this week. That dream , if my memory serves me well.. was about a woman who supposedly drowned in a river after disappearing down some rapids. Her group of friends were claiming that there was a possibility she was still alive and did not drown. Some guy, who was one of the woman’s closest friends was taking us down the river in his kayak. 

In both of these dreams I’m going off of patched together details of the morning, after waking up. I suspect these dreams may be about the same woman but that’s just me trying to make sense of dreams I don’t remember too clearly. The weird part is they have both happened during a time of visiting, but I haven’t had any creepy disappearance mystery dreams since coming back home. For extra context it’s been years since I’ve watched any true crime documentaries so that probably isn’t s factor as to why these dreams are happening either. ",2024-05-05 11:11:06

 I saw a microwave and rembered how scared I was boom self-aware. I tried flying (like Minecraft creative mode) it worked but almost fell 😭. I also spawned a mortal cycle and was driving through my old home places. Through the dream, I was almost awoken but stayed in. 

😔 towards the end I was going to do something I probably shouldn't have done. Then

 **BOOM** Paralysis demon 🤠. 

I looked at it, sat up, moved my hand,(in a buzz off thing) and said “shoo shoo” like a disappointed mother talking to a dog.  Then laid back down And woke up. 4 minutes after I was laughing and that was maybe 10-15 minutes ago?  🧍 did I do a bad thing? it also looked like a black version of this thing from Albert’s myth videos ",2024-05-05 10:45:27
862,Dreams,Did my dream determine life or death?,"Okay, I always hear about people who have had a death experience seeing the gates all that, my experience though is different. I was 20 years old delivering my child from a c-section. All was well for a couple days. I notice a massive lump forming in my abdomen, it got hot, heavy and extremely uncomfortable. Days later it's infected, size of a football the lump now is. I can't walk due to pain, I go to hospital, I have an infection (obviously) at this point. I get admitted, none of the antibiotics are working. At this point it is 11 days after c-section, I had a traumatic experience of a doctor coming into my room with a plastic set of tweezers and pryed open my healed c-section cut, it traumatised me everything gets pretty blurry from here and all the days feel the same. About day 17? 2 surgeries later cleaning the inside of my stomach out. I get told I'm going into the 3rd surgery!! This time they are going to be leaving me open and putting foam in me? (Still not sure what happened with this) I get put to sleep for surgery.. anyway. 2 weeks later I wake up in ICU, being told everything that had happened the previous 2 weeks. In the 3rd cleaning surgery while they were doing it, bloods came back that I had blood infection (sepsis) and the infection was too much for my local hospital to control in this surgery. I was put on life support in a coma and transferred to a better equipped hospital. I had 4 more debridement surgeries where they eventually got the infection under control (I had no idea this was happening) my family was told that the chances are not looking very good as they can only remove so much tissue before there is nothing else they can do to stop the infection spreading. Anyway I wake up after all this and l've never been the same since, when I was in this coma I must of still been dreaming! Dreams that I had no control of when to wake up it was terrifying I won't even begin to explain what happened to me in them, they actually did and still do feel real to this day like it actually happened. Anyway one stood out to me and it was so strange. I woke up and remembered this so vividly, I was having a dream driving with my boyfriend and kids along a road on a cliff, it went black, the car was on the side of the road, I hear ringing in my ear, l'm so exhausted don't have an ounce of energy to even speak, I just want to go I don't have the energy to fight any longer I don't want to deal with this pain for a second longer. I was imagining how damaging this is going to be for my kids, my mum, my whole family, I know they didn't want me to go but the urge was indescribable. Nothing else mattered. My boyfriend is yelling at me saying ""don't go to sleep. Don't go to sleep"" ""you can do this, you can't leave our kids"" the ambulance has showed up to the scene of the crash telling my boyfriend to move out of the way but he wouldn't and he was a mess, I got so angry at him telling him ""leave me the f*#* alone"" the first time in this dream I had any energy for anything. it got me that angry, that's the last thing I remember of the dream. I truly believe this impacted whether I died or lived, I have no proof but this happened to me while I was on life support in a coma so it's just what l imagine what the dream was about.. it has now been 8 years since this happened. And I still wonder what would have happened If I just gave up in my dream and my boyfriend walked away, if I would be here today or not. I ended up surviving have a lot of mental health issues from the experience and physical in the abdomen, I ended up with 70 staples. Which is now a pretty scary scar.

864,Dreams,I dreamed about two moons in the morning sky. What could this mean?," I was in a white balcony that streched to the infinite. I knew in my dream, for some reason, that i was a old white man.

 To my side, there was a teen black girl, and we were looking at the sky during the day, no clouds in sight.

 She pointed to the sky, and there was two moons side by side, the sun was nowhere to be seen. They were so close to the earth, they covered 1/3 of the horizon. The moons started to approach, until the moon on the right was covering slightly the left side moon. 

 The girl said to me ""The moon is covering the other, but once it disappears, you will be able to see the other moon in better detail"".

 The right side moon disapeared, lefting only the left moon behind. 

 Then i woke up.

 I am not sure what this dream is trying to tell me, but i am pretty sure there is something to be understood here. What do you think it could be?",2024-05-05 10:30:16
865,Dreams,Smoking,I was alone in my family home it looked a little different from what it normally does but I walked across the street to a gas station and I was able to only get one cigarette I had dreams of smoking before so in my dream I thought this was the first one in months it was only one too not multiple. I started smoking it in the garage but it didn’t taste good at all like last dream when I smoke but I still wanted to smoke it anyways. Someone I used to be friends with but no longer talk to showed but she needed something from inside so I took her inside and she saw I was smoking. I’m not known for smoking at all I never actually smoke so it was a little bit of a shock to her but she didn’t say anything I just saw that she kept looking at my cigarette I had. After we went inside another old friend showed up I never talk to anymore this girl I used to have a crush on but I no longer have feelings for and I moved on from she showed but with her bf and some other guy too and welcomed her inside if she wants and her bf too since I know they are together but the other strange man I said had to be outside I don’t welcome strangers. My sister showed up too at the time I was telling the man I didn’t know he had to stay outside she noticed my cigarette right away and started getting upset and asking my I was smoking and being rude to that man. In my head I was annoyed because why would I let a stranger into the house when I didn’t know him and smoking was my business. My old friend got upset too when I told the other guy to go outside so I turned to them both I haven’t smoked in months and this was the only cigarette I’m having in months so back off and I said if it upsets you I’m putting him outside you can leave and go with him outside. I walked away after shutting the door on the strangers face and I went to my bedroom. I could hear my sister yelling my name more aggressively but I just shut and locked my bedroom door. I called my girlfriend not to tell her about anything that happened I just wanted to talk and be on the phone with her she answered and I said hi more sweetly to her and we started talking about her day and other nonsense I thought in my head my sister was going to tell everyone in our family she found out I smoked but I also didn’t care I just wanted to be on the phone with my gf. That was the end of my dream. Not sure what any of it means but it was interesting I haven’t had a dream about me smoking in a while. Usually when I do dream that I smoke multiple cigarettes in my dream they taste good but this one I just wanted one and it didn’t taste good at all but I kept smoking it anyways. ,2024-05-05 09:32:39
866,Dreams,Had a dream about my late grandmother last night. Today is her birthday.,"I had a dream that I was visiting a mausoleum and that I ran into her there. In the dream, she was wearing a white dress and a white veil. And she started speaking to me. I recognized her voice and realized it was her after she removed her veil.

She told me not to wear a certain wedding accessory with another wedding accessory at my wedding. I can't remember what items she was talking about because my mom called my phone and then i woke up to answer it.


I am 38 and single (I also mostly date or have relationships with women now, I don't really date men anymore).

I tried to google the dream interpretation and all of it sounds great except for the mausoleum part. Everything I read about being in a mausoleum uses predictive language telling me that I am about to be ill.

867,Dreams,NDE-like dream,"I’m not sure if this post belongs here because I’m not sure what exactly I experienced, but most people I’ve told about it are divided between a dream and an NDE. I’ll choose the dream route. 

For context, I’m 19 and not the healthiest person, I drink energy drinks frequently and smoke. Sometimes it’s cigs and sometimes I’ll have some zaza with a mate. Not endorsing this whatsoever, these just happen to be things that are apart of my lifestyle. My family has a history with heart problems and sometimes I have light palpitations. 

Yesterday morning I woke up briefly in my room, the whole room was unusually white, like there was flecks of white all around the place, like my vision was slowly being overcome with it. I was very comfortable and felt very light. I heard a masculine voice say “We’re waiting for you.” I felt like my essence was slowly rising from my body, and I panicked. I thought, “No, absolutely not. I’m not ready.” Then everything went black, I felt like I was falling back into my body but subtly, because it hadn’t risen that much in the first place. Then I was back in my room, and it all looked completely normal. It could’ve been a dream, but it definitely didn’t feel like one, I felt very much awake the entire time but then again, I was also probably half asleep. ",2024-05-05 09:27:41
868,Dreams,Found the truth of universe in a dream lmao ?,"So I had this dream where I was taken in to a place , it was kinda like an office or something. So as far as I remember I had a notebook , and the person was telling me , here we have all the the knowledge in the universe. You think of anything you want to know and you will automatically start writing about it . So after that the person showed me around , it was like an office with people working , and he told me this is how we control all the knowledge in the universe and basically implying this is how we make the universe work . Then I asked him , is this like an afterlife , he said “no there is no afterlife when you die you’re just gone” . Then I asked what about the people working in that office , he said they are a select few that are chosen for this responsibility that can live forever. If I want I can also fill a form and they might consider me for selection . Now I was in the middle of filling the form when I **** woke up 😭. I so regret not finishing that form .

Next thing you know this spider comes running out from under my couch, the size of a toonie(2$ coin). It was really hairy, with big eyes and like red accidents on it. The dogs and cat were chasing it trying to **** it and we were screaming cuz the spider was jumping at us? I don’t know. Weird. 
My cat gets the spider and I’m like “**** yeah! **** it”
Then I see my cats eye widen, and I’m like what’s going on?! I see the spiders legs coming out of my cats ears and the tip of one leg coming out of his eye. It’s in the top of his head moving around. I’m freaked out. I smooshed the thing and killed it and FaceTimed the vet to look at my cats head and convinced him to fit me in so they could do surgery and get it out. He called me back and midway during the conversation with him the second time I woke up. 
Like **** was that?! What does it mean cuz I’m freaked out. 
These weird dreams happen to me all the time and I don’t know how to take it. I dream of teeth, snakes,spiders, people chasing me. I feel like it’s a lot to do with anxiety but this one was messed up. ",2024-05-05 09:13:42
871,Dreams,Do all women really have lesbian dreams? How many men do?,"Read this book from 1994 and was quite surprised by this. How true do you think this is? Women here, have you had a lesbian/homosexual dream? How many men have? Like if most or 'almost all' women apparently have these dreams could it suggest they are indeed subconsciously bisexual? How much would environment, conditioning etc play a role? I did look up some stats and one more recent study reported 39% of Spanish women had had same **** dreams, which seems far lower than 'almost all.' Maybe its not representative. Like...do most women secretly have lesbian dreams but just lie about it?",2024-05-05 09:09:46
872,Dreams,Had a dream of a loved one who passed away and woke up with a nose bleed,"I have spent hours trying to find a similar experience on here and can’t find anything so I wanted to post and see if anyone has any thoughts of this. Last night I had a dream about my grandpa who passed away almost 9 years ago. I was very close with him, he was basically my dad. He died when I was very pregnant with my first child. I had my baby 3 weeks after he died. I now have 3 children. I have dreamt of him many times before but few and far between and my kids have never been in the dreams. In this dream it was his birthday (which is actually in January) and the whole family was at my grandmas house that she lives in now. He never lived in this house. Everyone’s singing him happy birthday and he’s so happy. He’s waving his hands in an orchestra conductor style as they sing. My middle child is sitting next to him and I’m standing off to the side crying because I’m so happy to see him and see them together. I knew it was a very special moment and it meant a lot to me. Then he’s letting my middle child choose how big of a piece of cake he’s going to eat. And then I feel wetness start running out of my nose in real life (I’m still asleep). I think it’s snot like a really runny nose but I quickly wake up and realize it’s blood. A lot of blood everywhere. What does this mean? It seems really strange to me. I never get nose bleeds, I’ve only ever had one about 3 years ago during a really bad cold. Thoughts?",2024-05-05 09:06:10
873,Dreams,"""Say goodbye to them""","I begin a dream in which I'm in some kind of world populated by creatures, a bit like Undertale.

This seems to be the end of my adventure, I have to leave and say goodbye to everyone.

A black girl, whom I've never seen before, talks about her ambitions to go to university, her personal plans... and so on.

I change rooms and end up in a sort of exit hall. There are my parents, and two elderly people I'm not familiar with, a man and a woman.

My parents say to me: ‘Come on, J, say goodbye to your grandparents. And then, a bit like an over-emotional child, I rush over to them and give them a big hug, which surprises and amuses them.

End of dream, in tears.



For context, in my life I've never seen anyone from my family apart from my parents. I only saw my paternal grandfather for two hours when I was 15. As for my maternal grandparents, I only got to know them through phone calls and Christmas presents.

My maternal grandfather died of covid in 2021. Not having known him, or even seen a photo of him, I didn't cry when he died. Then, over the last three years, all my maternal great-grandparents have died. I hadn't seen any photos of them either.

I don't know why this dream affected me so much, I mean, to be honest,  why would I miss strangers?",2024-05-05 08:50:59
874,Dreams,Snake?,"i had the weirdest dream last night. it was the hardest i had slept in a while too. i’ve been awake for an hour now so i’m not remembering everything, but i do remember the important parts. 


i had bought a snake at a pet store. it was odd because the store actually exists in real life, but the oddest thing about it is that i am terrified of snakes. and in the dream i was scared too, but i got it because it was pretty? it was a pink and purple ombré color, and the head was big like the snake was built tough but it was small enough to fit in the box. the box was short in height but wide so it had enough room to curl up in, with bedding and little places on the side where you can see in. i kept it in my bathroom. the snake was not nice, but i think i made it worse because i was so scared of it. i didn’t wanna be around it. it tried to attack me and bite me, and i tried running away from it. eventually i told this one person i was afraid of it, and he took it out of the box and chased me with it around my neighborhood. the guy was scrawny, white, a bit taller than me with straight, dark brown hair coming down just to his ears. i didn’t see his face. but he was wearing a white shirt with light grey shorts. he kept trying to throw it at me, and i knew if he made it the snake would attack and bite me. he didn’t seem like my friend either, in a way i could feel that he had it out for me.

somehow the snake got back in the box but i thought the top was open, so i flipped it over. it was hard because it was heavy and i thought it would bite me. then it poked its head up and out of the box (i literally went oh **** in my dream) i knew it was going to attack me again. the guy chased me with the snake again, and threw it at me. i squirmed hard to break free and to not get bit, never once punching the snake. i feel like i provoked it beforehand though, and that’s why it was so angry at me. but even when i had first bought it it still felt like it wanted to attack me, but it wasn’t sure if it wanted that too.



i don’t know what any of this means, but i’ve never dreamed of snakes before. i heard they’re a bad omen. i tried looking online but the colors are supposed to be good, yet it kept being aggressive towards me. any insight to what it might mean is greatly appreciated",2024-05-05 08:39:34

877,Dreams,Strangely dreaming trought my life,"I have had weird long one-time dreams a lot in my life. These dreams are really interesting, because I remember them to this day very well. All of them are also pretty scary, but not nightmares, and in all of them I am another person. In fact, they scare me more during days, by making me think of them all the Time. It feels like they mean something, they are so realistic. I do wish that they don't mean anything, because horrible things happen in them, like in my most recent dream where everyone dream-me knew turned into black figures of themselves and black angels that formed from inside then started shooting arrows at me, or another dream where dream-me was sent to mental hospital three Times. Said like that, those dreams sound pretty ****. I would tell more about my most recent dream, but english is not my first language.=&gt;:)",2024-05-05 08:23:18

879,Dreams,Reoccurring dream. ,"I had this dream that started since I was in High School. From the girl saying “Hi” to going into dates and hanging out with some people inside my dream. It happens like once a month, and the weird thing is that whenever I wake up I forgot the face of this girl. I can only remember her lips and skin color. 

This year I’m already planning to proposed to my girlfriend, and last night I dreamt about this girl again.

Every dream, we are on a different place, she wears different clothes. I can hear her voice and remember it after I wake up but will forget about it after a day or two. The dream I had last night is that we are walking in an art gallery and the only thing I remember now is she saying “I hope you are happy”.

It’s freaking me out since it’s feels like real but I can’t remember her face at all.

Does anyone experience this type of dream or reoccurring dream at all? Is this normal?",2024-05-05 08:23:06

882,Dreams,"Does anyone else experience moments of horror when they fall asleep in a exhausted state?
","I find that on weekends where I stay up later than usual, I see a common occurrence where when I'm lying on my bed and start closing my eyes and eventually enter sleep, I suddenly these horrible images in my head. It's like the **** BFG blew nightmares into my room through my window or something. Yesterday night, I dozed off for a brief minute I think, then I was instantly flooded by some sort of lady Chinese Vampire. They were wearing some pearls and some sort of jade headpiece and it was demanding that I fix something that broke off from the headpiece. I start fixing it and after finishing, I go to place it back on their head. However, I did something wrong and managed to knock the headpiece off her head, shattering it in the process. The vampire lady goes in to a rage driven state and charges at me, hovering off the ground, her hands turn into claws and her mouth is wide open. At this point I'm flailing in my dream and I'm pretty sure I must have been doing the same in real life as well. I woke up after a while and felt like I experienced that scene in 'Get Out' where Daniel Kaluuya is constantly falling into some bottomless pit after being hypnotized, I was trapped in the 'attack' bit of my dream for like a good 6 seconds as I was straining my entire body to wake up in that moment. I also am not sure as my night vision is pretty **** in the first place but I felt like my sight was a bit blurry afterwards but went back to normal. 

I haven't really gotten around telling my doctor about it yet but I'm just curious if anyone else experiences this. It doesn't stop me from wanting to sleep btw, I happily return to my bed every single day and if I ever experience it, it's just a nasty shock for like 5 minutes and I'm dozing off again. I don't have anything like cold sweats, wetting the bed etc. just some awful imagery in my head.",2024-05-05 08:14:02

So last night i had a dream where there was a finger that was growing out of my arm (don't remeber if it was my right or left arm) and i started panicking i remeber seeing my dad and he told me yea that a finger like its normal idk and then i remeber some one else's hand bursting out my arm and later things became blurry (my dream was too graphic that my brain censored it lol) but i remeber alot of blood and me crying about not having an arm anymore (i belive that i dreamed some sort of body horror where there was someone or something growing inside of me) so what confuses me is like someone's else hand bursting out of mine i wonder does it have any sort of meaning is there a reason why i had such a graphic dream",2024-05-05 08:04:36

The world around me is always destroyed, it's like apocalypse happened there, and it propably is true because when i was younger i had a lot of dreams where i woke up in a apocalypse. Everything was destroyed, people we're getting sick. I think my parents even died, and i found a group of people that I'm with now. Which is weird because its like i have another life there.

888,Dreams,I’m having recurring nightmares. What do I do?,"I’m not sure what exactly this is called but there’s a couple of things I think might be the reason. Some background, I’m 19 years old. I’m starting flight school, and if you know anything about piloting, you know you can’t be on any prescription medication. From the ages of 8-18 I was on the same meds. The day I got off all my prescribed medication also happened to be the day I moved to a different bedroom in my house. Ever since the night that I moved bedrooms and got off my meds, I’ve been having weird dreams. These dreams always take place inside my bedroom, and typically it’s just a person standing in my bedroom watching me. I can’t tell if I’m awake or not until I turn my light on, but the problem with that is that I can’t feel myself wake up, so everything seems so real. Especially since it all takes place in my bedroom, and nothing looks different when I wake up except the person is gone. It’s never the same person either. What’s weird though is that I never have these “dreams” when I sleep other places. If I sleep in a different bedroom, nothing. At a friends house, nothing. At a hotel, on the couch, in the hallway, nothing. I only get these dreams in this bed. I can’t tell if I have some weird form of sleep paralysis that is just attached to this room, or if this bedroom has a bad energy. I need to know how to stop having these dreams. I haven’t gotten good sleep in almost a year now. It’s not just every once in a while either. It’s EVERY. SINGLE. NIGHT. I cannot take any prescribed meds. Melatonin doesn’t help. It doesn’t matter how tired I am or what time I go to sleep. I can’t make it stop. Please help me. I’m too scared to sleep anymore. ",2024-05-05 06:38:47

891,Dreams,"So, here's a very interesting dream that involves Bowser and Kamek.","So, about 7 months ago I had this dream that I still remember to this day. Basically, Bowser lived in my house. He went down the street until he reached a random house. He opened the door and it revealed a portal. He went in and Kamek, who had been following him out of fear Bowser was going to do something ****, followed him inside. They ended up in a forest that was completely on fire. There was a gate that let to a few buildings, which included the headquarters of my least favorite YouTuber. Kamek, who thought he was going to go into the headquarters, yelled: ""My lord! Don't go inside!"" Bowser then noticed him, nodded to the left (Kamek's right) and then went in that direction. Kamek looked left and saw what he was nodding towards: A school book store. He then came to the realisation that Bowser just went here to get some school books for his kid. Also, when they entered the building, the perspective suddenly switched to the fixed camera style like those classic Resident Evil games. I think the R.P.D. music from Resident Evil 2 might have even played, but I'm not sure about that one. Also, the place was bigger than a mall. You couldn't even buy anything special there, just school books. Also the place was entirely made out of wood.

Yeah, interesting dream indeed. I remember that dream every so often and think to myself: man why can't all dreams be like that?",2024-05-05 05:44:11

894,Dreams,"Eerie, vivid dreams","Recently I’ve had a recurring dream where I’m in a somewhat post apocalyptic world. It has a very zombie-esque vibe. The main thing that I remember is having to go with two people (in the dream they feel like close friends, although looking back I don’t recognize them), running up the backside of a tall hill in camo. It’s a very tall covered in short grass, with a narrow path that runs up the center. 

The overall feeling I have with this dream is adrenaline, mixed with a determination to complete a task and make it to my destination (in my recollection, an abandoned farm house in an empty field). No actual violence or confrontation takes place, it’s just the anticipation as the three of us running into issues as we are on high alert, trying to sneak to this house.

I’m almost certain this is a sort of stress dream, but just wanted to get it out there as opposed to being stuck with it nagging in my brain.

895,Dreams,dream analysis,"So I’m a believer of spirits and there is a spirit of a little boy living in my mom’s house. This boy has been there for years and he has never made any contact with me or my family, but I’ve seen his shadow form walking by a number of times. Anyways, one night I had a dream about this little boy in my house and I just KNEW it was him introducing himself to me. It was a very specific scene which I can explain in detail if anyone would like to know. I told my two friends about this dream, but I did not mention a single detail about what he was wearing, what he looked like, or anything of the sort. Somehow, my friend said that she feels like she can describe what the boy looked like. In detail, she described everything from the color of his hair, down to the shoes he was wearing. Another thing I didn’t tell my friends was the fact that this boy was holding a teddy bear while he was in my dream, but she knew that too. She said she felt like he might’ve been holding something in his hands, like a stuffed animal. Can I chalk this all up to her being very in touch with the spiritual world or is there another reason she was able to connect so well with me and list all these details???",2024-05-05 04:33:04

I follow him and pretend I'm doing a research project for school eventhough I hadn't committed to signing up in my waking life. I then see him again at my register this time he's intrigued because he noticed me in the library of the school. He doesn't say his name but eyes me up and down making me feel hot and flustered. I forgot to ring up 1 bag of chips and he hands then over to scan barcode facing up for me. Next time he comes in he smiles and says you again.... it felt so real like I'd already started to get to know him slightly. He grabs some snacks and as I'm ringing up his total he writes something down on paper and folds it in 4s. Then after he pays his total by card he walks away leaving the paper and his snacks. It's airheads mystery flavor 3 of them pink lemonade and a bag of bagel bites. I go to open the note and see an image of him walking out the front door of my job. This is where I always wake up.

899,Dreams,family imposter nightmares,"this is a dream I’ve had a couple times and honestly forgot I did until I had one tonight in the same universe.

so basically there are these imposters wearing my family members bodies that every night come and try to **** the surviving members of my family.

this dream I was in my house with my grandfather and we were locked in my room as I begged him to be quiet when the door to outside opened but he just didn’t understand the magnitude of the threat level here and would talk. 

I remember in the intermediates between each one coming into the house talking to my grandfather but I don’t remember what was said, only one where I said that we needed to leave after this and he agreed.

they came in a couple times, one left (can’t remember why) the second time it was my papa coming in to give us something? or to check on us? I’m not sure, but he was talking to a woman I didn’t recognize and when I saw her I knew she was one of them. She killed one of her own kind that was by the window and just blood everywhere I don’t remember if she killed my papa or not, but horrifying. 

I locked the door and waited again. This time, the one coming into the house I got a look at from the hallway as I looked down it, (legit getting chills thinking abt it.) it was the body of my uncle whose like 6’6, standing up straight up a completely blank face and I just got the feeling of evil all around me in the dream, so let’s rest on that image for a bit. ughhh.

I quickly closed the door and I’m trying my best in hand motion to tell my grandfather to be quiet, but I remember that I didn’t lock the second important lock. But he’s already there. (Now this is when my dream decided it was imperative for me to be able to see them even if my door doesn’t have a window going from an outsider pov of them to be crouched by the door over and over.) There’s a woman with him I don’t recognize who starts to taunt me, I don’t remember what she said, but I’m squatting at the door preparing to hold it.

At this point I’m starting to wake up, so I don’t remember what happens. But this feels like the predecessor to the other dreams I have in this same universe. It’s been a long time since I had that dream so I don’t remember a lot of it, but I do know that I was at my neighbors and my house was overrun by the monsters. My neighbors house is on a hill that overlooks mine, and I remember looking down at it being infested with them. Another dream involved me having to run down to my house to save my pets from the monsters.

900,Dreams,Been seeing the same person in my dreams every night,"So basically, i know a girl but I barely know her. Me and the girl only talked a few times due to my close friend. Tbh, we only ever say something to each other because of my friend (I'm shy/introverted, got a lot of social anxiety/trust issues, my friend is outgoing/extroverted and makes friends with everyone. Btw, I don't even know her name but I think I have a slight idea). I only see her where she works (a gym) and I frequent the gym. I've practically seen this girl for 5-6 months but only started seeing this girl in my dreams every single night for the past few weeks (probably 1-2 weeks now consistently)

Adding on to this, been noticing a specific girl name almost everywhere I go (including games), which has never happened before, (especially in the area i live in. it is a specific dominant ethnic suburb, so white names like the one I'm seeing is hella uncommon).

I'm not even obsessed, crushing or in love with this girl. I just see her, do my workout and clock out. Been feeling creeped out by this. Don't know what to think or what to do but this is what I needed off my chest. I rather not tell my friends cause they would most definitely tease me and get the wrong idea.",2024-05-05 02:26:35

905,Dreams,"Can sleep paralysis demons be aliens, parasites or other entities? What do they want?","Can sleep paralysis demons be aliens, parasites or other entities? What do they want?

My boyfriend has seen my paralysis demon and felt its presence at the same time as me, which inevitably makes us wonder if it’s possible for SP entities to be some form of an other-dimensional creatures.

Has anyone seen any scientific research or data about SP ‘demons’, do you get them without getting paralysed and do you think there is something they might want from you?

I always get the feeling that it just wants to be seen or feel powerful. We’ve both had tactile and visual hallucinations of the ‘thing’, we feel the same energy from it at the same time. The encounters are different in spirit as it tries to mainly scare me, and my boyfriend describes is it as an introduction or like it’s testing if it’s more powerful than him to get to me.

906,Dreams,Can someone interpret this dream?,"I just had a dream about a solar eclipse then an additional 2 moons (one is really colored with pattern of orange and red-almost cartoonish like) covering the sun again.  Then suddenly black winged horses with dark ""man-like"" creatures came down from the sky and started killing people. 
But before that solar eclipse, I was in a crowded city intersection, petting 2 stray dogs (I remember looking into these dogs eyes, one is a puppy and one is an older one and I think I had a thought of they knew that even though I am petting them, there is still the inevitable thing that I will still walk away from them?)
Then I was joined by one of my friends and that was when the solar eclipse happened.
As soon as she saw the winged creatures, she immediately pulled me and told me to run back away. But as I was running, I stumbled. And that was when I woke up.
Immediately tried sleeping again to continue the dream, but all I see are spinning Circles of letters blocking my eyesight. Then I feel an intense light on my left eye (even though I am in a blackout bedroom). That was when I decided to fully wake up.

Any ideas what these means? I am more bothered by the spinning circles of letters. Since I am consciously awake, and wondering why I am seeing this.",2024-05-05 00:42:00

908,Dreams,interpretation?,"recent wisdom tooth extraction had me taking pain meds that made me sleep HARD.

i dreamt that i was at work (i work in construction), on the job site i kept seeing my dad. it was welcome and friendly (like in real life). except i kept bumping into him in various locations. we saw eachother 4-5 times. i went to lunch, ran into him at the grocery store. he never pops up in the dream again after that.

upon returning from lunch, i found that all of my tools were comically large. completely unusable. my coworkers didn't seem to notice, their tools were normal. while standing there trying to make sense of it, i get a phone call from my best friends mom. (who i haven't seen, heard from, or thought of in years.) she tells me that my ex's kids mother had been hit by a city bus that morning and died. (in reality, the kids mom disgusts me. ex and i broke up within the last 14 days, because he was cheating with her.)

in the dream, i was indifferent to the news, until i realized that the children would be devastated and i wanted to comfort them. so i stopped everything i was doing and ran off the job site. i did not drive my car, i ran. harder and faster, and a longer distance than i could do in real life. (i live in the largest city in the continental US. running it is completely unreasonable.) about halfway across the city, while on a bridge, i became tired of running and jumped off the bridge attempting to swim the rest of the way.

then i woke up.

my life is chaotic right now, personally and at work. so i can see some possibilities as to scenarios, but i'd like opinions from people who are more knowledgeable on dream situations/symbols, please.

thank you in advance.

909,Dreams,Faceless woman gone ,"I remember standing on calm water, that stretched to the horizon in each direction, with that faceless woman. We talked and talked and imagined the rules of lives we might lead, we imagined each star up above being a different path to explore. Then she pointed out one particular star that was blood red, we hadn't seen one like it before, and as I looked at her I saw a tear run down her face before she just vanished into thin air and everything around me faced into nothingness.

I had woken up at 6 am and then fell asleep again which means I saw this in the morning. In my dream, there was a huge 3,4 goddess snakes, I am saying goddess cause people were worshipping it with pouring milk over its head, the snake was titanboa size and would shrink whenever someone was trying to present it milk. All the 3,4 heads of the snakes were joined together and her color was pitch black. I remember trying to pour milk over one of the snakes head when she bit me but still accepted the milk I offer then after sometime she showered milk on my head. I asked other NPCs (people) in my dreams that the snake bit me and heard one of them saying its normal, however the area she bit was swelling up and then I woke up.

918,Dreams,Trying to figure out this crazy dream! ,"Updated just to make easier to read hopefully. 

Trying to figure out this crazy dream! 

What in heck kind of dream is this?

So here's the dream. What in the heck?? Sorry, kind of long. 
From where I can remember, my dream started with friends &amp; I went to my late finance mother's house(my fiancee died in 2014). I didn't recognize the people with me. It's like we broke in &amp; I was afraid, but she wasn't mad. I felt a lot of deception within myself. 
 Somehow, the dream shifted to a hotel at an amusement park. I found a kitten &amp; some stuff happened, and a GIRAFFE ATE A KANGAROO. We were concerned about the giraffe like the kamgaroo was stuck in its neck .
 Somewhere in the dream, there were a bunch of people moving about in a large van. Possibly, how we got to the hotel. 
I remember this hotel being really nice and almost like a casino. Somehow we went to this special animal doctor for this amusement park but to get to him,
So this was a really important part of this dream. There was a hidden place in the hotel. You hit the 13th floor, then held down the 15th at some point.

 The elevator turned into a roller coaster. Up, down, side to side all around. THIS PART WAS SO INTENSE EVERYTIME. I WAS REALLY INSIDE AN ELEVATOR THAT WOULD INTENSELY SPEED UP, DOWN, AND SIDE TO SIDE. 

Then, around circular staircases.
 I had this kitten the whole time, and it was hard to control. This kitten was an important part of the dream. The vet guy was almost like a wizard but took to me. We went to check on the giraffe. stayed there a while. 
Then I went my own way—Fed the kitten french fries. I somehow, I ended up on the floor of my hotel room. I realized the kitten needed kitten milk. A special hotel maid helped with and took the kitten. Some people were in our room and made to change rooms. It was a big conflict. Like Family conflict. 

Then these CIA/FBI-type guys showed up. Acting good, but we knew they were bad. There were tons of people in this hotel. All over the place. The FBI guys were scanning the hotel with machines. Only we knew they were bad. We needed to get back to the hidden room. 

Went in and out of  multiple elevators, but couldn't figure out the right combo and were going up and down. And round and round over and over. Different people kept hoping in and out of these elevators preventing us from going this secret route to safety. 

Finally realized the elevator was stuck and couldn't get to the hidden spot. The maid that had the kitten and some guy working at the hotel helped us get there through these different circular staircases. The guy ended up being bad and just wanted to know the secret room's location. 

We went back down to the lobby. The FBI guys were all eating this soup, and we started knocking it out of their hands, and they switched from bad to frantically leaving the hotel. We were like fighting these guys. We were all about to leave the hotel, but all our adversaries and most of the people were leaving the hotel. 

We all laughed and relaxed because everyone was leaving. I woke up heart-pounding, feeling like I had just got off a roller coaster. 

I made myself stay awake. The dream felt like it lasted forever. I even think I got up to **** twice and went back into the dream. 

What do you think? I could have gone into more detail. It was very vivid and still is. ",2024-05-04 18:52:41
919,Dreams,"Trains work, nothing else does","I've had a good handful of dreams involving various vehicles (cars, planes, trains, bikes) and the only ones that work are trains.
Planes never take off, and just act like giant cars driving on the road, or I think they're taking off but it's really just going up a steep hill.
Car brakes and gear shifts don't always work unless I'm actively thinking about how it feels for a car to slow down/change gear. Which makes for a fun time when I'm trying to drive on a highway and can't slow down, having to zip through traffic to avoid any collisions. I've never gotten into a crash or gone off the road, so there's that at least.
The only ones that seem to work like they do in the waking world are trains. They shutter as they follow the tracks, but they always get me to my destination with no issues. The only odd thing is that sometimes they're in the sky, but then again it's a dream so it's not that weird.

922,Dreams,I dreamt that my dad’s girlfriend allowed a homeless man to eat part of my cat.,"Last night I had a dream that a homeless man knocked on our door, my dad’s girlfriend   answered and he told her that he was hungry and needed something to eat. Instead of grabbing some food from the kitchen, my dad’s girlfriend offered our cat to the man and he sat down in the living room and started eating him. 
For the first couple minutes of the man’s meal I was unable to move or speak, and I just had to watch it happen. By the time I was able to move again and stop him, he had already eaten two of my cat’s legs and part of his face. 
My dad took our cat to the vet who patched him up the best they could, but his face was still messed up, and two of his legs (one front leg and one back leg) were missing. 
He couldn’t balance well enough to walk, so he would just pull himself around the house by his front paw. He also seemed to be in a lot of pain because he was crying constantly.
I don’t know what this dream means, I love my dad’s girlfriend and I know she would never let our cat get hurt. It was probably one of the scariest dreams I’ve ever had, and I remember it very vividly. ",2024-05-04 18:10:44
923,Dreams,Sitting man in my room ,"Hello!   
I need to know what this dream is about. I have 3 nights in a row dreamed about a man sitting on my chair in my room and it's dark but the room in-front of mine has like a lamp, so it's not totally darkness. Anyways, he just sits there and doesn't say anything. I asked one time ""what is it?"" and he replied with ""its okay, go back to sleep"", and I did. He doesn't frighten me or anything, like I'm not scared at all, but I don't personally think this is normal.

To summarise it: The last 3 nights I had a dream about a man sitting on my chair in my room. I can't see him but I heard his voice and I don't recognise it. I talked to him once and asked him ""what is it?"" and he responded with ""Its okay, go back to sleep"".   
  
Im not scared etc, I'm just wondering what it means and if this is normal. And I'm not a vivid dreamer. Im currently on vacation in my home country in the Balkans so I'm not ""home home"", but I'm home (I'm ethnically from here but I don't live here with my grandparents).  ",2024-05-04 18:06:23
924,Dreams,This dream kept recurring with the same outcome until one day the ending was different and the dream stopped ocurring,"Hi, this is my first ever Reddit post and english isn't my first language, so please don't mind any mistakes.

I normally don't have dreams, it's like i go to sleep and then immediately wake up, but when I occasionally do have dreams they are either crazy and silly or very disturbing nightmares.

Now let me get to the point. First, let me explain the dream: I appear as a lets say 20yr old woman  who bought a new house and loves exploring it. I don't remember what was happening in the middle, like I said, it stopped ocurring. But at the end it would always end with a middle aged man chasing me around the house and later on k|ll|ng me in the backyard.

This dream would occur like once every 3 months or so but I always recognized it. Until once the same dream ocurred, however it had a different ending: I as the woman escaped the man with the help of some old lady (probably a neighbor) who called the cops.

After that it never ocurred again and it has been like 6 months and I just remembered this and wanted to share this.❤️ Also, I am still kind of freaked out by this and if someone knows the meaning of this let me know please! 🙏🏻

I hope you enjoyed my ramble haha😅 and stay safe!

926,Dreams,Have your dreams ever been so boring that you can’t stay asleep?,"I’ve always had vivid dreams. For the last 15 years or so I’ve had a major issue with work or school dreams whenever I’m in periods of my life where I’m overwhelmed and overexerting myself. From ~14-17 I worked multiple jobs at local arcades. I always had 2-3 jobs at a time throughout high school (was “homeschooled” so I was free all the time) and was juggling 40-55 hours between my jobs at any given time. I was definitely overwhelmed. When I’d finally law down for a few hours of sleep every night my dreams were filled with the familiar cadence of laughing kids, the sound of coins hitting their metal holders, and various arcade machine sounds. My dreams became continuations of my long work days. I’d have dreams like that 1-2 times per week.

Thankfully by 20 I just had one full time job and would occasionally have work dreams that felt like continuations of my days. This mostly happened when I would work clo-pens or doubles for multiple days in a row and again struggled with dreams that felt like continuations of my work day. Rinse and repeat when I started college a few years later. 

I recently started a new job where I work 12-13 hours a day. I’m always exhausted as it is, but those mundane dreams have recently started again. 

I’m a way I feel like my dreams are so dull and boring that I just can’t stay asleep, if that makes any sense. I’ve been struggling with them almost nightly for the last month. I feel like I’m slowly losing my sanity. I haven’t had any kind of restful sleep in about 3 days now. 

Have you ever experienced this? Do you have any recommendations on what I could try (aside from cutting my hours at work) to help avoid these types of dreams? I mostly want to make sure I’m not the only one. 😅",2024-05-04 17:39:46

Just woke up early from my nap thanks to her 😃

So it’s 11 PM here and I was dreaming about my old apartment building. It was unusually dark inside the level floor hallway but we had to go up but we were too scarred

So she started trying to push me down the open elevator shaft like “get in get in”. She dirn’t see that the shaft was open and when she realized she quickly ran away scarred. I didn’t get crushed, but someone else in further demonstration did.

When I woke up I saw that the room light was turned on and she’s folding her clothes or sum.

Dream 2: It was just like 3 white people outdoors, and for some reason, they were making a massive pizza and baking it on the top of a car. The pizza went far from the hood of the car to the roof. They spread barbecue sauce on it as well.",2024-05-04 17:22:34

930,Dreams,Dreams affecting me in real life,"Last night, I had a dream where I was burned on the backside of my hand, and it woke me up. When I woke up, I immediately felt an intense burning and tingling sensation in the exact same part of my hand for about 5–10 seconds, and then it fizzled away. this is what i really want to know: if this has happened to anyone or anyone has ever heard of it

Another time I was in a dream and I was being pulled down a never-ending staircase at about 100 miles per hour . remember the never-ending staircase in Mario 64?? literally exactly that—all dark, black and red . something was pulling me backwards at seemingly impossible speeds and my wife was watching me. i was sitting up in bed with my arms stretched out, shaking uncontrollably, going ahh ahh, ahh ahh ahh and drooling on myself . all while still completely asleep. she thought i was having a seizure . all the time, I could feel an intense breeze, like someone put a huge fan right in front of my face . That part happens to me in dreams all the time where i fly or am moving fast somehow and my whole entire body becomes super responsive, i guess to the air. Idk, its like I can feel every single atom of air on my skin at once, and it feels like someone is blowing a fan on me . its really a crazy sensation.

crucified,  
The dreams seem to be affecting me physically .

another time, a few months ago, I had one dream where I was horrifically murdered, crucified, and killed in everyway way imaginable from a first-person perspective. but i was not waking up . after I died, I would wake up in another place in the situation of being killed . I remember someone digging a grave and throwing me While I was alive, dropping 100 tons of boulders on me and squishing. , I would wake up in the middle of the desert sand dunes . anyone remember the movie tremors? and was being eaten alive by a giant 1000-foot freaking snake monster swimming thru the sands , then I was being chopped to pieces like something from the movie. when i woke up from this dream, I never felt so strange in my life . Emotionally, I felt as if this had actually happened to me . it affected me for days and i was supper depressed I actually felt in real life like I had been murdered horribly in multiple ways .

Anyway, id like your guys thoughts on this, especially the being physically affected by the dreams.

933,Dreams,Dream Highlights,"I had a uncomfortable dream earlier that I woke up from, then fell back asleep and it continued. I saw a streak of light everytime I fell into sleep. Would that be astral? I was in the space between sleep and awake.  I had a nightmare that was starting to get scary/anxious, and that made me call out someone's name. A mutual friend. He appeared, coming into my dream. Instead of waking me. I woke up after to fall back.

In the dream I was in my house, and it was strange appearing. Zombies were about to take over the house/space. It was like pet sematery, except they were shape shifters or droids. I assume. I can't remember the first half of the dream anymore. Well, the first whole dream, technically. I took too long to get up again. I was taking in so many details, constantly. Every second was being used with something gaining my attention. My little brother was important to the beginning of the dream, I know; not taking the apocalypse seriously. My other little brother and mom were there as well. I vaguely remember seeing a painting, gray paint. I was either painting or taking pictures; maybe I was taking pictures of the painting. That was likely what I was doing. I walked through the house, venturing past displays, furnishing and stuff that was sitting around. I saw a brunette guy with '90s hair. He talked to me about something. 

All the people in the room began to turn into zombies/droids, shutting down. In the second dream, it was happening there. I remember seeing a group of black girls; survivors. They were surprised and fearful to see me. There were virtually no humans left. There was an asian girl too. I was interested in the material things that were left behind. I looked at the paper that was on the table outside the makeshift area the girls were hiding inside. Along with whatever else was there, a photograph or vhs tape? The area looked cartoonish, or little-tikes like. They cowered on the couch. I memorized the color pink, which must've been their shirt color. I wanted a glass of something pink to drink, which shows I was lucid. I saw a vision of it forming. I then sat down on the couch, surrounded by a few kittens. They were frightened. Humanly, emotional. They may of been turned back to normal. Behind us, shadows of the creatures were lining together, outside the house or behind a panel of glass. The wall or sky was a deep cobalt blue color. The fabric of the couch or one of the collars on the kittens were purple. I mentally thought to myself that this was like evil dead. Connecting it to that film. I woke up around this.

In the next dream, I was in a room that was pastel, victorian. A dollhouse was within the house; also pastel. I took photos of it, right beside the wainscotting. Pink, teal, purple colors. You would think yellow too, since it was victorian. A blonde woman walked inside, because I had snuck into her house. 

A memory of my older brother stealing my mom's money to buy a kurt cobain memorial shirt flashed  through my brain. Which I wasn't even alive for/during. I was then a room full of old people, seeing packages on the floor. I picked up a broken mallet that was for harley quinn cosplay, knowing that it was mine. It got damaged. It wasn't properly wrapped for shipping, like my mom does for the stuff she sells online. A image of marge simpson went through my head. My grandma was in the room, taking me outside. We went into the hotel room we were staying in, where my little brother was. I sat on the bed and watched a video/homemade b-movie me and my partner made, which showed me and him ****. My brother and grandma wanted me to turn it off, before it was even remotely graphic. It wasn't even explicitly ****, at all. It was nothing. I went out of there, finding myself in living space full of strangers/creepy guys. I must've been invited into here. That 70s show images/audio played in my head as I walked past a hispanic dude and his friends. Mila kunis and Ashton were on the tv because of a few news reports. After making myself acquainted with the guys in the room, a scientist or teacher walked in, getting my attention. My man was strapped to a chair, blindfolded it seemed. He set a virtual reality headset over his eyes. I looked down at his ****, seeing it pretty hard. It aroused me. He vanished, because I spent the rest of the dream looking for him. A group of boys, blonde, hid from me. One was holding a baby. I assume these were our kids. I woke up feeling, wondering if they are real souls waiting for me. One of them, I gripped his pointy chin; thinking he looked like layne staley. He had the sweet and subtle smile. **** hair. Earring, which I barely noticed. They all crouched underneath a table together. I went through the house, going upstairs. It felt like a penthouse, because there was a indoor pool on the top floor. It was a bathtub, overflowing with suds. And of course, water. Directly next to it, was the wall to the kitchen. Oven pressed up against the wall, silver and expensive looking. Large.

I saw another blonde woman, in the kitchen. She ushered me away, keeping me away and being vague about where my husband was. I heard shower water running, vividly. I wanted to go in the wherever the other bathroom was. I felt like it was to the right of the kitchen. I woke up after this.

934,Dreams,Reoccurring dreams about deceased dad and childhood home.,"I have these dreams once in a while. They're always similar. My dad passed in 2018 so it's been sometime. The dreams have him in there and it's in my childhood home but I'm an adult. There's usually something going on that's different Everytime
Sometimes I'm there with my dad and a event like a tornado is taking place and we're seeking shelter. Or sometimes I'm there and he isn't and I'm trying to reach him through phone or text but I can't. Or sometimes it's just me and I know he's around but he's busy at work or elsewhere and I'm dealing with a bear trying to break in the home. 
These dreams have been happening for a few years at least. ",2024-05-04 16:13:41

936,Dreams,Repeated dream on departed loved ones - thoughts?,"I have been having these recurring dreams for months, maybe even a few years now. Background before we get into it: my dad passed away few years back, and before then my dog that I had for several years did too.

So the dreams are never exactly the same but the theme is. My dad has either been at a hospital and I forgot to visit him this whole time, or he's been dead and he's back and we are happy but REALLY unsure how to explain this to people. 

Then there's the dog dreams...my boy...we'll call him Duke. For example, last night I dream that my mom came over and she had Duke with her. He had been staying with her all these years because I didn't have room in my.house for him with our other dogs and my son. (He died of old age and lived and incredible life, so I don't know why I'm dreaming this).anyhow, I'm still heartbroken and its really bothering me today even though it was obviously just a dream. It wasn't the first time it's happened. What on earth is my subconscious trying to work out? 

I've always been a vivid dreamer since childhood,  and lucid at times. Sometimes it's fun, othertimes, it's heartwrenching and can almost ruin a day because of the emotions it brings up. 

Anyhow, if you've made it through, thanks. Interested to hear if anyone else experiences this or has thoughts ! 🥰

937,Dreams,Accidentally killing someone in my dream as a butterfly effect. ,"So I dreamt I was going home after a long day. I saw a rock in the road and decided to kick it down the hill, it gained a lot of momentum and hit the floor windows of a nearby eye clinic. I was panicking a bit and decided to hide in the crowd to escape guilt. I heard the people whisper how this messed up the equipment a surgeon was using to operate on a young boy, this caused an error that ultimatley killed him. I started hurrying back home praying no one saw me and heard people whisper on the street ""The equipment caught fire"" and ""The room was destroyed"". I knew I was in BIG trouble.

When I got home I got a call from my father. ""I've been a good dad, haven't I? You know that game you've been wanting to play? I'll buy it for you.... Oh, I'll call you back. The police came to my workplace for some reason.""

I started praying, I don't know to who anymore. I wanted to go back just a few minutes so I never would've kicked that rock, I don't even know why I did. Then I woke up. What do you think that could mean?",2024-05-04 15:18:23
938,Dreams,Dream diary day 1:,"Hi fellow dreamers!
I have always been a very vivid dreamer, often dreaming very bizarre, funny or scary stuff.
The last few months I have been having nightmares or incredibly bizarre dreams weekly and I keep saying I should start keeping a Dream Journal.
Well, what better place to do that than r/Dreams?
So, as of today, I am planning on posting my dreams daily, starting now.

Trigger warning! This dream is quite gorey and disturbing.

&gt;! I've had a breast reduction in real life, about two years ago. I dreamt that I wanted another one, because I wasn't happy with my current size and scarring. For some reason, the only way to do that was by literally chewing chunks out of my **** and spitting the flesh out. I could taste it and even felt sick, but I just kept going. Then, when I was ""done"", I looked into the mirror and saw my absolute mangled ****. I felt a wave of shock and confusion, wondering what the **** I've just done.!&lt;

Then I woke up.",2024-05-04 14:56:23
939,Dreams,help with my dream what does it mean and why do i feel so traumatised from it.,"here’s what i wrote from my notes (this is all i can remember right now) it may not sound bad but it was so vivid and i was present throughout it all and now im so scared to sleep.



walked there
mom (who i don’t talk to)and her boyfriend was there and my best friend and all i remember is getting asked to go in the car to spin donuts but i wanted to get out because i had apparent trauma so i did and i was crying and screaming saying i wanted to go home but it was like no one heard me and i forgot some and then this man gave me money to get a. taxi but was teasing me about it and i don’t remember the other bit
i remember waking up idk where and it was like all grassy and locked away as if it was abandoned but above the train tracks and j kept getting weird memories come back but i didn’t know why but i thought about it more and i remembered the **** and i got drugged and **** but i don’t know who did it all i remember after is dad hugged me and ven was there and something happened with her and i screamed at her telling her to leave and just leave then i was in class but it was an abandoned building but still was in school and i asked to go to the toilet and then there was these weird people out to get me for some reason u believe one or two to be a police officer but there was also a woman idk who but they wanted to **** me and get me and i don’t remember why or if one of them was the **** i really don’t know and i wish i knew, i woke up just as they got me. i for some reason think my boyfriend and best friend also tried to attack me idk if it was part of the other group or just them 

i feel traumatised 

i remember them now it was a. group of college student who originally asked me to play. a game with them all i remember is some mixed race guy and i ran away half way through but i don’t think they attacked me i remember adults attacking me and properly hunting me down but idk who and why

there was another group of people and they were in the abandoned bit where i was left and they had weird eyes and powers and there was a black girl and two white older men and the man’s eyes turned all white and he went all scary and then i ran towards the woman and she did the exact same thing but weirdly this was after i showed them how to escape like i did? with someone but i dont remember WHO and all these ppl were police officers because i remember cutting back and showing me, but were these who attacked me?

940,Dreams,I had either a profoundly traumatic or a spiritually enlightening dream and I cannot decipher which it was. ,"Hello all, first time poster in this sub. As per the title, I have marked this dream as NSFW. 

Some context: I have done over 20 000 hours of meditation in my life. To my benefit and to my detriment I have gained the ability to fully visualize and create emotions or sensations and this does affect my dreams, to an extent. If I experience something in a dream I will often be able to feel the effects during the dream, though they seldom carry over to my waking life. I am also someone who frequently experiences flashbacks and this also lends to my ability to experience real world effects while dreaming. 

Now, my story from last night. Taking place from ~1:00am to 3:34am. 

I find myself in a prison, with two companions (Rufus and a tall man who’s name escapes me today). Our goal is to escape and this is accomplished by activating three switches, guarded by warden’s. 

The bulk of the dream is spent wandering cell to cell and floor to floor in search of the guarded cells. We encounter the first warden very quickly. The wardens resemble reavers from the ‘firefly’ universe, heavily mutilated and with distinct, aggressive **** piercings. They carry one weapon, that I can only describe as a pistol that shoots a small plunger. The warden describes the effect of the weapon as having the ability to sedate and drain those it is used on of all their life force. 

We are able to disarm the warden and use the weapon against him, he falls and dies very quickly, though it was seemingly painless. We press the switch and move on. The encounter with the second warden goes very much the same way. 

The third warden is found on the top floor, he has chained himself to the cell door and is yelling that we will not escape without tearing him to pieces. Rufus and the tall man rip the chains apart with ease and I retrieve his weapon, that he did not chain himself with. I point the weapon at his and pull the trigger, only to have the weapon fire back at me and hit me in the head. The warden starts laughing maniacally as he draws a standard pistol and executes Rufus and my other ally. As this is happening I feel a profound heavy weight roll across my body and I fall to a knee. I look up at the warden as he does a “villain monologue” as is often seen in movies. 

He lets me know he has been watching us.  Thanking us for releasing the souls of his brothers and describing how he set a trap, he knew we would fall for. As I get heavier, I fall backwards as the world begins to fade to black and a deafening ringing begins playing in my ears. The warden walks over to me and brandishes a knife, I can no longer understand what he is saying. He begins to carve up my face as the heavy feeling in my body begins to pull my mind away from my body. I start feeling an indescribable chilling sensation through my entire soul as a darkness envelops every piece of my consciousness. The pain from the knife slashes fade quickly and I can no longer feel anything, only my breathing, which is rapidly slowing. There is now nothing to “me” anymore, just a void and an occasional breath as I fight with everything to not let go. 

The world of my dream starts fading from my mind and I am now just floating, in an infinite expanse of darkness (no body, no thoughts just a complete absence of being). Out of nowhere I feel my consciousness screaming “not now, not ever” and I focus my entire being on that thought, I begin to feel the heavy sensation coming back and I scream into it in my mind. I scream for what feels like hours and I begin to recognize the feeling of my bed on my side. I hold onto that feeling and allow it to take over my being. I then start to feel my blanket and pillow. I put my entire being into those feelings and slowly pulled myself back to the real world. 

I am now in my room, watching myself from above as I shiver and force myself to breath. I grab myself and pull my consciousness back into my body. I start feeling that heavy feeling and the deafening ringing in my ear s again as I slowly start waking up. It takes me a few minutes but I eventually sit up and do a general wellness check on myself to ensure I did not just have a heart attack or anything like that. As far as i’m aware, I sustained no real lasting damage from the dream, but I have a profound sadness this morning, as well as the lasting feeling of infinite terror and hopelessness that I cannot seem to shake. 

I wanted to share this, as I believe it to be a rather extreme dream experience and I would like to at least have it saved somewhere. I also wanted to share this, to alleviate some of the mental burden it has on me, as I do not plan to share this with anyone in my personal life. 

If you made it this far, thank you, truly, for reading. 

I apologize for any spelling mistakes, my phone is really struggling to keep up and there is nearly a 1 minute delay from me typing and the words showing up now. ",2024-05-04 14:14:19

943,Dreams,Bizarre nightmare that lasted around one minute but was enough to terrify me,"this started with a dream that was pretty long, but close to the end it turned into a nightmare that was horrible, as it was a long dream I will jump directly to the change to a nightmare, here how it goes:

It was a long dream that feels like a normal day, I was at my house which is an apartment on a high place with my brother and mother, my mother was in the couch sleeping, I was seeing some lightnings falling from my window and then started raining, then I saw a person in a ladder and there was a bystander close to him, the person on the ladder was doing something to a pole (was probably an electrician), I thought that this person was risking his own life because was faling many lightnings, then the nightmarish stuff started happening.

Suddenly a very strong lightning fell on that electrician and he fell down from his ladder, it was such a loud sound that it scared me and I walked backwards shocked with what I saw, my mother woke up with the sound, then I saw the bystander in a way that looked like he was floating, and the bystander started to scream in a way that was so loud and terrifying, and the strangest thing of it is that the scream was coming from the walls of my apartment, and that scene happened 3 more times with other people in the same way and so fast that it terrified me, all of the times the lightning fell on the electrician, he falls and the bystander screams in the same way as before.

All of the bystanders were in a way that looked like they were floating and somehow very close to the window, and more people were appearing at a point that there was close to 50 persons and all of then somehow floating and close to my window, I was terrified of it all because I felt like reality was being broken, my brother and mother also watched it all emotionless, then suddenly my brother went in despair and said in a scared tone that we need to block the windows with wood.

And it ends here, the sudden change on pace from a random dream to this and all of these strange events happening so fast seriously terrified me.",2024-05-04 13:47:52

945,Dreams,What could this possibly mean?,"Usually I don't dwell on dreams too much but this one was so vivid and so odd that I just have to know what it's supposed to mean

It starts off with me at the airport with my dad getting ready to leave for bootcamp. I'm in the line for security when I notice a girl that looks exactly like an ex that circulated some not great rumours about me maybe 3-4 years ago. I look back and she sort of pretend hides behind a pillar or post of some sort. I then ask ""The **** are you doing (ex's name)?"" She then comes back from behind the pillar and we start talking. She introduces herself as ""Sydney"" and states that she somehow knows what happened between me and said ex. She seems genuine and kind and we talk for a bit more and then I go through security. I realize I never got any contact info so I ran back through security to ask her, she then runs away, and once I catch her its a guy dressed up as her, I run around calling her name to which people in 1920s clothes direct me down what looks like the dilapidated hallways of a hospital. I never see the girl again.

Obviously by the level of detail I'm able to provide it was an extremely vivid dream, and I want to know what the **** this all means.

953,Dreams,Dreaming in the same place every night,"So this is super weird and I need to know if anyone else experiences this. It’s hard to explain, so bear with me. 

For around 5-6 years now I’ve dreamt in the same place. I call it my dream world. Think of it like a map in a game like GTA or Fortnite, very big and different sections and areas. There’s a city area, a more mountain terrain area, a river, some body of water and bridge, a very eerie neighborhood, a theme park and then a beautiful empty side. And in the different areas, I can tell if it’s going to be a bad or good dream. To be honest I haven’t really had a “good” dream here, I think just once. They’re typically very horrifying and something bad is happening or someone is chasing me or even more horrible things. 

The beautiful empty side I mentioned is usually more calm dreams. That’s where I had the one good dream. The neighborhood part isn’t too bad either. She very very eerie and creepy. Feels almost paranormal when I’m there in my dreams. 

The river, hotel, bridge, theme park, and mountain terrain area are where my worst dreams happen. I remember them pretty vividly for dreams and they still give me the shivers. 

Sleep hasn’t been enjoyable for a long time because of this. I can’t seem to understand why this happens. I’m beyond curious to see if anyone else has experienced something like this. I have looked all over Google and forums and I can’t seem to find anything about it.

If anyone has any insight, please let me know. It’s driving me crazy lol ",2024-05-04 11:11:35

I can’t remember which play it was either, but I know it was a popular one. There was a large audience at an outdoor theatre at night. Anyways I went on stage and did not practice my lines so I had to improv. I remember my stage mate looked at me like **** are u doing. I felt so embarrassed. When I turned around the crowd was pretty much gone. Later on I was driving, the sun was very bright so I couldn’t really see but I just kept driving talking on the phone with this girl I have a crush on IRL. She was talking about this boyfriend she found and I was like oh that’s great, I’m so happy to hear, but inside I wanted to cry and was really angry. And then I woke up. Overall, I will admit there’s a lot going on in my life right now. I’m very stressed with school, work, and with this girl constantly on my mind. Coincidently, Recently for school I had to do a presentation which I did last minute and did BS it. So maybe this dream is just a reflection of what’s been going on lately.

I surprisingly didn’t wake up from the dream, but instead I woke up in the dream and saw multiple of my teeth on the floor and picking them up.

957,Dreams,I dreamt of my ex and I don’t know what it means,"My ex left me in July 2023 when I was extremely sick and very mentally ill. I have borderline personality disorder and I always felt so triggered being around him. What’s worse is that he decided to leave me and cut me out of his life rather easily even though I spent months crying and feeling extreme pain from the breakup. It’s been almost a year and my ex is still an extremely sensitive topic to me and I don’t think about him much anymore. I also have a new boyfriend and things are the best with him. 

In my dream, I travelled back to the city my ex was in and took a bus to visit his grandparents, whom I still love very much, and I wanted to say hi to them. In another scene, I was in this same city but in an auditorium where I saw my ex sitting in the crowd. I didn’t want to go interact with him but the seats were assigned so I ended up sitting beside him. He reveals to me that the girl he dated after me had left him. (I had strong suspicions that cheated on me with her and easily moved on because he was already with her barely a few weeks into our breakup where he kept telling me he loved me but he didn’t want to be with me). I kept ignoring him, telling him I didn’t want to talk and that I’m hurt. He kept trying to talk to me so I stood up and he stood up to grab my wrist. In that moment I felt like I was hyperventilating in the dream and out of fear, I pushed him hard. He started yelling at me and telling me how I’d never be good enough for anyone and that he left me because I was such a horrid person and a burden to him. I started crying in my dream and kept begging him to stop and when he didn’t I pushed him to run away and he fell over backwards and hit his head and died. Everyone in the auditorium then started chasing me telling me that I’d never be able to be loved and that I am never good enough.

959,Dreams,Another awful (and physically painful) waking dream,"I use the term waking dream (hypnagogia), but I’m not 100% that’s what they are. But I’ve had them my entire life, dreams that feel like I’m awake with my eyes open, seeing the room around me. They happen randomly, generally when I’m very tired, and they are generally terrifying. This wasn’t the scariest by far, but the most painful. 

Last night I couldn’t sleep, so I went into our office around 3:00 and laid down on a spare mattress. The room has cardboard boxes all around from us cleaning, so I was on the floor in between a bunch of junk. I don’t remember drifting off, but I guess this is where the dreaming began.

I picked up one of the cardboard boxes (while in bed) and held it above me, examining it. I grew sad and contemplative, thinking about how my son is growing up and how he will eventually stop playing with boxes like this. I imagined him in the box, peeking out as if he was playfully hiding in it.

The next thing I knew, I was laid out flat on the mattress, stretched out stiff and painfully straight. The box disappeared from my hands, but my hands were still floating above me, and I was unable to put them down. The mattress beneath me disappeared and I began floating stiffly up toward the ceiling. I grew an intense pressure in my ears, and felt like every muscle and tendon in my body was going to pop as I was forced to hold my body stiff while suspended in the air. I couldn’t move, except my head was now turned to a painful 90 degrees sideways. I tried moving my arms, but couldn’t, and I tried moving my lips to yell out to my wife, but couldn’t.

I guess this is where I woke up, but it took me a while to recognize I was awake. This dream had less events occurring than they normally do, but it was the most physically painful. I am disabled with a disease that causes muscle contractures, so being straightened out like this was awful. 

I’ve had these dreams randomly for as long as I can remember, and they’re generally terrifying (like seeing an old man in tighty whiteys in the corner), but this is only the second time I’ve had the intense pressure in my ears. I had this during the last waking dream I had a few months ago, and it was genuinely the most terrifying experience of my life, so much so that I was afraid to sleep for days. So, as soon as I let that feeling again, I knew I was in for a bad night.",2024-05-04 09:33:20

I dreamed I was traveling by train. And it was really pleasant. I liked it. It had artwork all around and there were interesting people. I remember the color red being prominent.  I was on the train because I was on the run from someone or something. I was trying to hide my true identity. But I wasn't scared. I also helped another girl escape by pretending I hadn't seen her when someone was looking for her.  


On the train, they held these storytelling events. And I was asked to share my story. I was nervous because I hadn't rehearsed and I wasn't sure if I could hold the listeners' attention. I wondered if I should add piano to my story and it kept getting complicated. I remember these specific chords that I really liked in my dream.

964,Dreams,A dream of a turkey offering me raspberries?,"The most I could remember was there were 2 turkeys, and one started walking towards me. At first I was going to run away (thinking it would peck me) but something told me to stay. I let the turkey walk to towards me and they didn’t speak but I could almost sense that they were going to give me raspberries.. I woke up before I found out if they were giving me raspberries or not. The turkey didn’t seem aggressive.. any interpretations ?",2024-05-04 08:09:39
965,Dreams,Short but weird ,"Last night i had a dream that i was scrolling through TikTok and saw a woman that looks like Robin from ""How I Met Your Mother"". But instead of having her brown/dark brown hair she had the same colour hair as the blue trumpet from the show. Also for some reason she was saying in the TikTok that we as viewers should calm down because we were being **** in the comments for ""Priya"", who she apparently looked like???

966,Dreams,Why are alot of my dreams is being stuck in a loop of waking up when I want to wake up irl,"So for context I just woke up like for real I even pinched myself and it hurted so I know im awake. Its that ive been trying for like 6 times to wake up irl but it always endes up in a dream. Now the dream consisted of me waking up in my room and prepare for work (as im working this morning too irl) But theres always something preventing me from doing it. The dreams are always different but it starts normally but when I realise im dreaming strangely I cannot talk or move normally then I ""woke up"" again with different things happening (like one of them was me trying to text my boyfriend but i couldn't find his number on my phone then realised I was dreaming then ""woke up"" again) It took like 6-7 dreams for me to actually wake up. For another reason I do not know, when I woke up irl I was so tired I almost falled back asleep but I told myself &lt;&lt;**** nah you aint doing this **** again&gt;&gt; So yeah now im here writing this hoping someone can help me find out why it happens and also frequently (its not the first time ive been stuck in that loop dream thing.)",2024-05-04 07:59:39
967,Dreams,Religious Signs in my Dream as an Aethiest,"I’m not new to gruesome dreams but last nights was just upright creepy. Honestly believe that this one is my weirdest dreams by far.

Instead of showing the images like a movie, my brain distorted it into short clips such like edited YouTube videos. To be specific, those “10 \_\_\_ deaths” videos. It basically started off with showing me rapid fire edited clips of people screaming and falling off of places right before their deaths with an over voice of a male. It then proceeded to tell me a few stories in a succession of least to most creepy as the male voice counted up from 1 to 10. Somewhere in the middle, my dream starts showing me more detailed version of deaths while going further in depth as the creepiness rose. One of the deaths I remember was the religious statue death.

Basically there was a man made statue placed under a short wooden bridge in a small town in Malaysia (I asked somewhere in my dream where this was and my brain zoomed out from a corner of Malaysia, showing me the world. Oddly enough there were extra continents southeast with interesting colors.). The statue only showed the neck and head and was pale white, indicating it was quite new. There were two faces, one in the front with a disgusted/neutral face and one in the back with a happy/evil face. I could make out the statue seemed to be a bald, middle aged male. My dream then shows a woman standing on a cliff in front of a large canal which leads to a dense forest through a drone shot. It doesn’t show me the woman falling, leading me to assume it’s one of those free editing shots that a lot of **** channels use. Back to the statue, it shows the rushing spring water and a woman climbing down the **** to get to the statue — a close shot of her feet as she slowly steps into the stream. It then shows me that instead of a rocky or pebbly surface, the bottom of the stream is completely smooth and curved and looks oddly similar to an ocean-continent convergent. The voice over is back, stating that the woman‘s body travelled down stream and was **** into the bottom through unknown means. It then shows a news report of a expert geologist, stating that this is abnormal and is possible it was a human sacrifice to suffice ****. He then scribbles some markings on a picture of the statue. A small spiral on the forehead, an arrow pointing south along the nose, and two consecutive dots on the chin. The dream then cuts to religious believers traveling to the statue to graffiti the markings onto it. And that’s number 7 of the creepiest deaths.

Onto number 8. My dream clips to an image of a large swing positioned at the edge of a large cliff with hardly any security. For context, it looked extremely similar to the Sulak Canyon Swing in Russia. One of the woman sitting on the swing then suddenly falls, landing in a shallow delta. The voice over states that this woman still had her phone on her, and an air tag was placed on it so as her body traveled down stream, her best friend who was with her at the time was able to track and record where she was headed. It then leads us to a muddy trench with a narrow and deep ****. The ground was unstable and seemed about to collapse as the rescue team tried everything to retrieve the woman but was unable to, pronouncing that they have no idea how deep this trench is and she could already be at the bottom of the Earth. The best friend later goes on social media, stating that she mourns her and it haunts her everyday how she can still she her best friends resting location due to the air tag still being on her.

And this was my creepiest dream.",2024-05-04 07:47:19
968,Dreams,Hopeless ,"My boyfriend broke up with me a little over a week ago. I've been having a lot of suicidal thoughts, and I tried to **** myself a couple of times, but I couldn't do it. But I've found that I feel better when I'm asleep, so I sleep a lot. Today I had a dream that I was kidnapped, and the kidnappers shot me. I was really scared and I was calling out for my mom. When I woke up I found myself just wanting to go back to sleep. And I was thinking, I would rather be in a scary torturous dream than awake. And I questioned why that is. The conclusion I came to is that in the dream I had hope. Even as the kidnappers were killing me, I believed that if I kept calling out to my mom maybe she'd come to save me. But now that I'm awake I have no hope. I know that no is going to make my life better. No one will fix the emptiness I feel inside. It's just me, and I guess since I can't bring myself to commit suicide I have to learn to live with the empty.",2024-05-04 07:29:57
969,Dreams,Nightmare about mushroom spores and stones coming out of my skin.,"So about a couple of nights ago I had this bizzare and downright disturbing dream where a was walking through my childhood backyard and coming across a weird looking mushroom that kind of looked like a spleen with mold growing on it. I plucked it off the ground and I started to poke it.  After about 2 or 3 squeezes it released an ungodly amount of spores. As soon as I inhaled some tiny little stones started to pour our of my skin. It was excruciating. I felt every single stone crawl out of my pores. It was so bad that I woke up and can somewhat feel them on my arms. If anybody knows what the **** this could mean please tell me, this dream has been bugging me for like a week, I barely go to sleep anymore because I'm afraid I'll dream of it again.",2024-05-04 07:29:17

I feel like a piece of ****. Should I do more 🌿",2024-05-04 07:13:24
972,Dreams,I hit my dad in a dream,"It felt so real, and all the feelings behind it and why I did it too. I don't know if this counts as a nightmare but I hated it all and I woke up sweating like crazy.

At first it felt real because it started as me sleeping with my boyfriend, what I'm actually. Then I hear thuds and noises from downstairs/outside the room. I thought it was real because my head was saying ""your brain wouldn't lie to you like this."" It was my bf's mom and my dad coming upstairs, him banging on the door and talking. I got up irritated (bf was still in bed), and went to talk to him.

He apparently came to tell me something but he was so nontransparent and going back and forth as to why he was here. Finally he said along the lines of me being so busy that I forgot some cousins were leaving. I said bye to them, and while they went back to the car he went and laid down. I tried to talk again with him but it was still inconsistent and it escalated my frustration.

We jump to getting outside because I had to tell him the cousins were ready. More back and forth, him pointing the finger at me for forgetting and me trying to explain that I'm busy and trying my best with everything I'm in (school, finding a job, art, family, my relationship, etc.) We're closer to the car, and I say I'll say bye to them again in case they die (a big fear I have), and he apparently didn't hear me because he basically tells me to do so. And I smack him in the face and scream ""because you made me feel that way!""

The rest of the dream is more muddled, but basically I try having a conversation of why I forgot and all the things I'm doing, and he just isn't letting me speak. I have to find different distractions like neighborhood dogs to pet as to keep myself. But eventually it's too hard. I try one last time and tell him to just stop talking and listen. And he does. For a few seconds. I start about how focused I've been with school and he interjects by asking about my grades. I lose it mentally and just get away from the car to get back in the house. I think other stuff happened but this is the large majority.

I don't know if this needs context or what, but I needed somewhere to put this so I can remember for therapy. It feels like I'm unraveling in my relationship with him given past and present events, his attitude towards my boyfriend since we've started dating, his constant need to get words in, and while I need it it **** hurts because I still live home and almost always in the end I need to still say bye like how to my cousins, because if he happened to die before I speak to him again I know I'll break.",2024-05-04 06:54:24

974,Dreams,Is this dream reality confusion?,"I just had several different dreams where I can't tell the difference if it's the dream world or actual reality the most recent one I could remember is I'm at my house with my sister and these guys crashed in fourwheelers and they were trying to get their fourwheelers back on the road and then water starts to rise for some reason and we all drown and I actually have all my senses and I felt the water and drowning and I can't tell if it's real or not at all the transition from sleeping to the dream is too well like I wake up in the dream, it was like my everyday life in my dream but it they were very unstable. it's like I wake up there and I'm actually there like it's real life and it felt like I was **** I guess I can say. Why did I have all 5 of my senses I really do not know but it was really weird that I seriously couldn't tell if I was in a dream or reality. Any thoughts?",2024-05-04 06:41:01
975,Dreams,Weird spot on my leg in a dream,"That is the Omega Nebula. It'll make sense later.

I was having one of these really weird but actually cool dreams (I hijacked a train in the sewers for some reason, fought the driver off, and rode it to another city), and at the end of it I was talking to someone asking me the reasons for why I'd done that. 

Midway through the conversation I noticed a really large pink spot on my left leg that looked kind of like the Nebula image above, but as something you would see on your skin. Looked kinda like a burn scar, and was similar to the picture in general shape and color.

People don't really speak normally in dreams, so the person I was talking to asked me if there was ""long deep hair"" on that spot. I said there was, and then the dream abruptly ended and I woke up.

What the *heck* does this mean? I'm not sure if this is the right community for people to analyse other's dreams but... I'm kinda worried about my health now lol. That scar or whatever sure didn't seem friendly. I guess I'm just being superstitious but what do you think?",2024-05-04 06:37:51
976,Dreams,Had the craziest dream,"I was going to my apartment at night after going out, and right in front of the elevador I found a lion cub. I got it in my arms and as I was holding it I was freaking out like ""what am I going to do?"". Then a man appears, and for some reason I knew he was a vet. So I gave him the lion cub and went home.

The next day, I'm at the mall. I had to finish packing my bags for a trip and idk why it had to be at the mall. So I'm walking to my car at the parking garage with my bag, and right at the sliding door, another lion cub. (For some reason this one looked like Simba). I hold it again, freak out again, and the same man shows up and I give it to him. (No I cant tell who he was I don't even remember his face). 

Then I proceeded to my car and put the bag in the trunk. And some guy from McFly appears (I honestly have never heard anything from this band so I have no explanation as to why I knew this was a guy from the band but I just knew like the thing with Simba). I took a picture with him and then he asked if I wanted to go inside for ice cream. I love ice cream so I accepted. Just made sure my things were in my car and my car was locked first. 

Once again inside the mall, I find another lion cub. This time I knew it was a female. And that man shows up, holding the second lion cub, and instructs me to come with him so we can take them wherever they were supposed to be. (Important, we did not exchange words in the dream, I just knew who he was and what I was supposed to do without him saying anything).   

The 3 of us are riding down the scalator and I'm holding the female lion cub. And we approached some kind of vet out in the open in the middle of the mall, like a big kiosk. There was some vets doing surgery in an animal and some people giving baths to other (can't tell which animals they were). And some girl just tells me to give a bath to the lion I'm holding. At this point I'm so confused and I just start giving it a bath. 

The ice cream shop was right across from it. I could see the guy from McFly getting out ice cream and kinda laughing at the whole situation. I was laughing too. And that was it.

PS: This is my first time posting here, idk if I'm supposed to give some context to what I'm going through right now or what is my interpretation. But if so, I will edit this post later. Thanks!",2024-05-04 06:25:05

986,Dreams,Dream about some kind of creature with legs for a head,"Last night I had a dream in which my family and I all shared a home with another family with whom we are close friends. For the majority of the dream, nothing particularly interesting occurred and it mostly just consisted of mundane social activities.

Anyways, towards the end of the dream, both families were in one room, playing some sort of board game I think, when I entered a large, downstairs area for whatever reason - apparently my parents' bedroom. There was, as I recall, a large bed with thin white sheets on it, under which there seemed to rest some kind of humanoid figure. I don't recall how much of it was underneath the sheet, but I remember its outline resembled a human with no arms and legs in place of their head, much like the mannequins from Silent Hill 2.

I don't recall how I replied, but it greeted me in a low man's voice with a raspy yet scratchy sort of tone. I think it then told me it knew the truth on some matter or other that I can't recall, before it began to roll over, somehow moving the sheets off its body as it did so. I think its back had a rusted crimson colour, but I didn't get to look very long because I woke up only a moment later. 

I really wish I knew what it was going to tell me, but I guess I just wasn't ready for the truth.",2024-05-04 04:13:41

I find myself in situations where there is heavy conflict yet I know what they speak of. after regular conversation it slowly becomes a screaming match, then more show up before suddenly blacking out, I come to within the dream and I find quite a few on the ground, bloodied, beaten. I just look at my hands and they are bloodied with several broken knuckles, including them protruding out sometimes. Each conflict within is different and but they always end the same. I have never done this in my life, and I do not want to unless I am therefore provoked and forced. I’ve been trying to figure this out within the past week, yet I came up short nothing, at first I just went with it being stress related, but when it happened on a stressless night, it still occurs. I don’t know what is happening, am I losing it? Am I slowly going feral without knowing it? Will I make it with this demon my whole life or is there a way to shut it down at the source, I’m tired of these, they make me restless, I find myself in my thoughts wallowing in these.
