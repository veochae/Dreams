0,Dreams,Best and worst dream of my life.,"
I'm laying In bed with my girlfriend and there is this beautiful, thin, black girl laying with us. We both end up fucking her and afterward my girl is tired so she tells us to go hang out and do our thing. She gets up and goes to My parent's bedroom and I follow. When I go in there were hanging out and talking and she kisses me and shit, and then I want my girl to come and hang out too because it was much more fun with her. I was enjoying myself but I knew how much more enjoyable it would be if she was with me too. Without her, it just wasn't the same. As I'm walking out of my parent's room she follows out and flashes her ass at me. Then I have the thought that, wait a minute, isn't everyone supposed to be home right now?I go back in the room and see the black woman, the same one maybe in her 30s there, and I saw she was laying there with my mom. I tell my mom I'm sorry and apologize about it and she says to me it's okay and looks at me with the most serious sinister look and in a very off-putting tone says to me, that girl is not even there and apologize and she looks at me and says it's ok, she's not even actually here right now. Confused I think well I'll go see what my dad's doing so I walk out to the living room and he's sitting on the couch. I try to talk to him too and he can't hear me at all, I try touching him and nothing. Nobody can hear me, nobody can feel me, nobody knows I exist. Then I get this feeling of fear wash over me. Everything starts to look and feel completely wrong. Scared I run into my room where lyndsey is asleep on the bed. I run to her and try to grab her, desperately in need of help. And nothing. Then I stumble backwards and I can see the whole house and everyone all at once. Absolute terror washes over me as I realize I must be dead. I'm in hell, my own purgatory. This is it, I'm stuck like this for all of eternity. And I begin to feel as though I'm almost starting to morph into a new location but before I do, one last desperate attempt I start screaming for help from my girlfriend. It felt as though I was screaming for an eternity. But moment by moment I would catch small glimpse that she was laying in my lap, which is where she actually was. So I start to get some hope that maybe this is permanent but I'm still struggling. I try again and barely get any further. But I felt as if I was able to move my arm. Just slightly but enough to give me enough motivation for another attempt. I don't know how many more attempts I might get, so with everything I have in me I start screaming and trying to flail and just get help from anywhere. It felt like I must've been screaming for a solid 5 minutes straight. But I'm able to get a sound out, a very slight noise. Nothing anyone could hear or understand. Then slowly as the sounds piece themselves together, and get to a volume that can be heard, I'm able to do it loud enough that my girlfriend can hear me. At the moment it was happening I had the realization that what was probably going on was that I was in sleep paralysis, but the utter terror of everything before was enough to make me not want to possibly chance that if I don't wake up right now, I might never wake up. Then my girlfriend sees what's going on and she gets up and comes to my rescue. And just like that, I'm able to snap out of it. An intense feeling of relief washed over me. It literally felt as though she had saved my life. If I wasn't able to get out of there at that exact moment, I feel as if I would've been sucked back in and sent off to experience different versions of hell all at the same time. As I was fighting to wake myself up in the last moments, there was part of me that wanted to give up fighting, and just accept the reality that this was it, this was my new experience of life. Maybe it's something I would get used to, no matter how scary and fucked up it might've been that maybe it would've been okay for me to accept it if I was the only one that would ever have to feel that. Shortly after the feeling of tiredness kept coming on so strong that I couldn't fight it again. Absolute scared to go back to sleep and possibly experience the same thing over again. But I went and layed down, my girlfriend who was back asleep again. And then without really noticing drifted off back to sleep. I didn't dream again, at least not significantly enough to remember it. But this dream I remember so vividly as though it actually happened. It started off as feeling as if it was one of the best dreams of my life and rapidly dived into an absolute nightmare.",1674536639.0
1,Dreams,Parallel earth has 3 of my exes,"It was strange in the sense that the beginning of the dream played out like the ending of a fucking Johnny Test episode. In 3rd person, I saw myself, the Test sisters, and some of my friends in a pod in space, flying away from earth. We got a call saying we were late for an event. We informed them we would be very late. Then the end credits happened.

After they ended, black for 3 seconds. Then its first person. I am on a planet that very closely resembles earth, but everything's a little off. The roads of my home town are slightly angled in the wrong direction, the sky is permanently orange, everyone is acting strange. Where the sun would usually be, you just see the real earth up there.

My group, no longer consisting of the test sisters but of me, my roommate, and someone I recently met in class, are on a mission to get back to earth to make it to that event in time.

We are in a Cinderella style horse carriage, going down a road in my hometown. We get stopped at a red light. I look out the window opposite me, and I see 3 of my recent exes sitting on the ground, each with a different hairstyle, making bracelets or something.

My first thought was how cute she looked, then I remembered she was my ex. I looked down with a poignant sadness on my face. Then I was like ""oh shit wait, I like this classmate of mine. If they still think I'm stuck on my ex, I won't have a chance!"" So I regained my composure, and noticed they were giving me the side eye.

Then I woke up",1674535367.0
2,Dreams,[f/23] had a dream I had a sexual encounter with a trans woman… what does it mean,"some context first: I identify as bisexual and have never been sexually or romantically attracted to a trans person (not sure if it’s preference or circumstance) but generally i like femme woman and more feminine men- but interestingly just got out of a year relationship a month ago with a pretty masculine man. currently not talking to anyone or seeing anyone like that, just trying to be on my own for a little. DM me if you want more context to analyze further.

In the dream I was at a party with my 2 roommates and they introduced me to this very attractive girl, off the bat I was into her and she expressed interest in me. She asked if I wanted to play pool and I love pool and enthusiastically said yes. While I was racking up the balls she comes behind me and presses my backside against her erect penis. I was shocked because I didn’t know she had a penis and kind of played it off bc we were in public but was also turned on? I think we finished the game and I went back to my friends and asked one of them about her and they were like “she’s so pretty you should go for it!” In my dreams I remember wanting to pursue things but then dream ended.

Pretty interested by this because I rarely have sexual dreams, let me know what you think!",1674534291.0

4,Dreams,Dreams about underperforming at work,"Does anyone else have nightmares about underperforming at their job? For example, being incredibly late, or being unable to do the job well at all? I have these nightmares repeatedly. 

I am a server and trainer for a steakhouse. I have a good tip average, and good sales overall. I’m never late and my guests love my service. In reality my coworkers can often have horrible days and the same shift for me is like walking on sunshine. But I am having nightmares about work regularly. Often it is about being late for work and then not being able to catch up. 

My most favorite work nightmare was me being 2 hours late because I was a Bichon Frisé. I rushed to work in my dog form and everything was difficult because I was running around the restaurant as a little dog with hair as long as I was tall, panicking and trying to fill coffees with my dog paws. 

Today I had a nightmare that I was a little bit late and I couldn’t get to any of my tables in a quick and efficient manner. Guests were miserable, impatient and demanding, and their orders were horrible. Upon finally getting to a point of sale to ring the order in, I had to type out every single letter with just two fingers, like I was an Aye-Aye. And then it would take me 10 minutes just to bring them water or coffee. I was working in a space very different from my real life workspace. The server stations were upstairs and clogged with my coworkers. Also I went to the bathroom and it took me forever. The guests were getting fed up and serving themselves from a saucier station, and then my coworkers weren’t helping me, and I even had a few tables walk out because I couldn’t run their food in time.",1674533866.0
5,Dreams,"Had a dream where I slit someone's throat with a knife in the back of the car, Should I be worried?","I was in the backseat of a car waiting for my dad to leave the gas station. A guy (appeared homeless / very poor and dirty) opens the door and sits in drivers seats and puts hands on steering wheel. I take a knife out of somewhere and slit his throat and feel nothing, even after I woke up.

6,Dreams,Attacking the Ghost,"Hey guys, I have a question.

I searched up on Google but all I could find was people getting attacked/choked out by ghosts/demons in their dreams.

However I just had a dream where there was this ghost/demon thing ( sort of looked like the ring girl) and instead of getting attacked I fully ran up to her and choked her against the wall to stop her from pulling any shenanigans. There was no fear, not even rage, just a huge NOPE YOU AINT DOING SHIZ.

Any ideas what this means? Lol.",1674532167.0

8,Dreams,"As a child, dreaming of shapes/sensations that get bigger, sort of like floating","This reoccurring dream I had as a child (which started around 7 years old) is super difficult to describe. I experience some trauma when I was around this age and I think it is related. but not sure. This dream/sensation became so common to me and occurred sometimes into my older years and I think once in a while in adulthood. I say dream/sensation because I could see the images but more importantly, I could feel my arms sort of hugging the shapes as they would slowly float by. So, basically, when I would start to fall asleep, I would see blackness in my mind but images of squares/cubes and rectangles would float by slowly and I would sort of wrap my arms around them and float with them. The dream was never scary but I could feel my arms around the shapes so it was very much a sensation. There was no end to the dream/sensation and no people or things would be in the dreams except the shapes - mostly cubes or squares. I think eventually I would fall into a deep sleep and the dream/sensation would fade away. I think this would happen right at the beginning of falling asleep. Has anyone ever had something like that happen to them? I later became a lucid dreamer (even to this day) and have very intense dreams most of the time. I have never been able to find anything about this sort of dream in my many years of research etc. I don't know if it is related to my trauma but sleeping was always a big issue for me as a kid. And, I was a bed wetter during this time when the dream started.",1674529831.0
9,Dreams,WARNING: gruesome: Dreams about hurting animals?,"The past week I’ve had two dreams in which I have hurt cats. 
*Gruesome details incoming* 
It started with a dream about my cat having her head bitten off by a predator but her head still being “alive” like her looking at me and meowing. I then took a hammer and killed the head. I woke up that morning traumatized and frantically looking for my cat. 
Last night I had a dream some YouTube hunting/camping vlogger made a video about eating/cooking cats so I found a stray and cut the cat in half, but immediately in the dream felt remorse and sadness and guilt and then I woke up. 
I’ve never had disgusting dreams like this and they’re really bothering me",1674529372.0
10,Dreams,Any idea what this means??,"I had a dream about work and finding my way around because I'm new. At one point towards the end I look around and the whole scene changes from my job to an outdoor scene in what appears to be the hills of Scotland. Very green. Mountains all around us.   A little hut/cabin 🛖  off in the distance. Closer to me was a person dressed in all black. Trench coat and a hat is what I remember. He was holding an umbrella and was opening and closing it while looking directly at me. There was a small fire next to him with produced smoke. The umbrella seemed to be creating a message with the smoke like how native Americans used smoke signals. 
Nothing much happened afterward. 
Does anyone know what this might mean?
 I don't know how to read smoke signals and it looked very intentional",1674528307.0

I’m a straight female in a long term relationship in real life. In my dreams, the man usually changes, but generally looks the same. 

What the heck does this mean? This is a very recurring dream. I’m starting to think my subconscious is telling me my real life relationship is fucked.",1674525518.0
14,Dreams,Dreaming about praying for forgiveness,"I added nightmare bc I’m not gonna lie, it was two separate dreams. The first one was supper Erie and it caused me to wake up in the middle of the night. I completely forgot what I dreamt about. Therefore when I went back to sleepy I had this nightmare-ish feeling again like in the first dream. I don’t remember the parts well from the start of the dream but I’m remember that I’m in a car with my coworker and someone else. I didn’t turn to that someone else who was riding in the backseat of the car, therefore I don’t know who it was. I was telling them how I did something bad , to me that bad was minor, I called it barely dipping a spoon into what I did. Then my coworker asked me, well if it isn’t that bad - what are you gonna do?  During which I had this sense of evil ( or that sense of fear you get when you’re scared ), which made me uncomfortable. It wasn’t from the people I was with, it was just an awareness. I began I tell my coworker that I would use prayer. Therefore I looked at the moon ( crescent moon) and began to pray for protection ( I grew up catholic so I think I prayed 4 times ) as well as forgiveness. I acknowledge that I did something wrong and that if my guardian angels would protect me. 
Then the dream ended after I finished prayer and that sense of ‘evil’ was gone. And we were pulling up to my house. 


I’m trying to make sense of the dream, since it didn’t clarify on what I did wrong. 
Also I didn’t check the time when I woke up the first time, this second time it was around 4:48-4:50 am.",1674524400.0
15,Dreams,"I've dreamed of the same person for 3 days and every dream is negative,should I be worried about her?","I (F16)is currently studying as a senior in high school,I have a classmate (F17)who is also a good friend of mine,we are good friends but not super close.
Recently,I've been having vivid dreams about her and in my dreams,she is always afraid, panicking and shaking.Whenever i have dreams of her,i always wake up only remembering the negative events of the dream

My first dream happened at midnight sunday,
#1 the class were swimming and she slipped and drowned
I thought it was weird but I brushed it off cause I thought it was some silly dream and didn't bother share it with others.

Sunday night I had another dream about her,this time we are at a mall setting
#2 I was shopping quietly till she ran to me crying,she told me ""*my name*PLEASE HELP ME, I'M LOST""over and over again
This made me really concerned cause this was the second time it happened,but then again I didn't bother tell her at class cause I thought it'll make her feel uncomfortable

Monday night (yesterday)I again dreamt of her
This time,it was way worse
#3 we were sitting in a couch with my grand uncle (whom I don't have a good relationship with cause he has SA'd me before),he started touching the hem of her shirt and trying to lift her shirt up.
I couldn't keep with it anymore so i told her that I've dreamt of her for the past three days

17,Dreams,Just a Dream I had last night,"Don't you hate those dreams when they are better than reality? I'd rather have a nightmare than those types of dreams. The dream itself was just so real, but to give context it was with this girl in which we tried to work things out but they didn't in the end, I was kinda in such a low mood after that for a month. But in this dream things worked out and man I was just happy like literally happier than ever before, I would just enjoy each moment of that dream and when we were talking about our day I just woke up. I felt so empty in the morning but just kinda moved on. The thing happened in summer so it was quite a while ago.

19,Dreams,My Dreams.,"I keep dreaming of my ex, and it’s so painful. The dreams start off of me holding them in my arms after winning a national championship, next they would look at me and I would look at them with excitement, then it would change so dramatically. I would go from looking at them and them looking at me with the biggest smile, to being metaphorically stabbed in the heart. Sobbing, sobbing in my dreams on my knees would lead to me sobbing in real life while I was dreaming. It burns me so deeply to let a beautiful woman go, and they had the most caring personality. Young love in high school. I thought it was going to last forever but it’s okay because I know that’s not the case. I mean me and her are friends but I could never bring myself to ruin a friendship, but might be time to distance myself? I don’t know. Maybe someone with some wise words can help me understand this. The relationship was about 4 years ago and I had new relationships since then but I don’t know. Every time i’ve been in one the thought of them was in my head and infatuated. Dangerous. I just need some help. This is also a way of me to vent.

20,Dreams,The happiest I ever felt (or one of the happiest moments) was in a dream. Can anyone relate?,"I had a very vivid dream and I remember it to this day. It was more like an experience. I was in a little boat or kayaking (I don’t remember exactly but most probably kayaking since after that I wanted to buy one) but I was sitting into something and I was in the middle of a very crystalline and pure water in the sea. Probably the Pacific, and I could see the fishes below the water and the chorale etc and all the beautiful colors. It was great and I remember at one point getting closer to the beach and starting to touch the sand with my feet and ultimately getting Out of the water.

I remember that it was so colorful and with such clarity than when I woke up I felt really bad and depressed because I wanted to be there. At that time I got kinda obsessed with kayaking (just because of the dream) and wanted to convince my parents to travel to Hawai some day (tho probably the closest places to my dream are some islands in the Pacific).

since i know G men or fbi looking guys were not to be trusted. i remember after pulling it out i think i tried shooting at the one on the far right then BAM i woke up.

28,Dreams,Dreams about dying in from an atomic bomb. I actually feel death?,"I have had at least 2 vivid dreams about dying in an explosion. Each time I see the explosion and experience the same feeling. What does this mean? 

Dream 1: This dream was very simple and short. I was on a beach or place with lots of sand. I was just standing there and BOOM! I saw a mushroom cloud , and a orange wave coming toward me. At first I was scared I could feel my heart beat fast AF, but as it got closer I began to calm down because I knew there was nothing I could do about it. As the wave got closer the brightness began to get so white then I felt a jolt of energy for split second. It didn’t hurt but I knew that I had been hit with the wave. At this point I was just in a void area (this is the point I feel like i died). I had no senses I just knew I was in a place of nothing. Then I woke up.

Dream 2: This time I was with two people and I looked around it was super hazy. I saw a gas mask and put it on. The other two people were coughing and I magically found some oxygen to give to them. I know odd but it was a dream. Then I saw the cloud. The weird thing is that I remembered the feeling and cloud from my previous dream. I knew this was a dream and I was about to “die”. So I wasn’t anxious, I just watched the wave come our way. I saw the same brightness and once hit I experienced the same feeling of being nothing in a void place. This time I stayed in this state for a while until I got tired of feeling the strange feeling of being nothing and told my self to wake up.

29,Dreams,Let me Be - In one ear and out the other.,"Dream:  I felt an itch inside my left ear. When I went to scratch it, I felt a sticky, waxy sensation coating my fingertips. It had the texture of a wad of wax and it was about to come out, but I kept losing grip from how small it was. All of a sudden the itch went away. I let it be.

A few moments later the itch came back with a vengeance. I reflexively reached into my ear having a better grip this time and removing it. Then suddenly out of my left hand, the bothered thing flew out resembling an angry bee.  It buzzed from left to right in front of my eyes for a few seconds. The wing’s vibrations were tingling my eye lashes forcing me to squint. The emitting buzz was as loud as helicopter blades. 

As the bee hovered from side to side, it quickly shot to the right and straight into my right ear. A stabbing pain similar to a hybrid bee sting and ant bite set fire to my ear. The immediate pain triggered my reflexes swinging my right hand into my ear canal. I attempted to remove the bee in an exercise of futility. The bee wasn’t going anywhere without a fight, biting even harder cementing itself. In desperation of the escalating pain, my thumb and index fingers miraculously gained a grasp over its plump fuzzy body. My grip became stronger and stronger as the pain grew in size. In a tweezing action, the bee’s grip faltered plucking it off my ear and slamming to the ground

I stomp it. A few seconds went by before I removed my foot carefully. Surprisingly the bee seemed unharmed with the exception of one of shattered wing while the other wing buzzed erratically. The bee desperately moved in a circling motion trying to survive like a fish out of water. I stomped it a second time placing all my weight down at the ball of my left foot. The body severed in half - guts everywhere, followed by a third and final stomp to finish it off.

I reached into my ears and felt a warm, waxy sensation on my left ear but no pain; however, my right ear felt swollen and painful to touch. 

Suddenly a prompt sensation of relief and clarity ensued, waking me up. I come to my senses and realize it’s still dark out. I tap my phone:  4:11 AM. Most importantly I check my ears to confirm their normality. I'm so confused as to what it means, but the sensations were so vivid and unforgettable.",1674512413.0

Starting on May 4, 2022 I had multiple dreams about young children in a school hiding from a shadow monster and several people on reddit told me it was a premonition of what happened in Uvalde a few weeks later.

And I had a very similar dream to that a few weeks ago, the dream specifically took place in California this time and specifically 11 people died. What happened in this dream is that I saw 11 birds that were scared of yet another shadow monster, in what I thought was California, and the 11 birds flew into a white tunnel of light, (this was ""the tunnel"" and ""the light"" that people see when they die), but I saw my recurring dream character named Jennifer waiting for them inside the tunnel with a smile and they were all happy to see her and to meet her. I am a pretty religious person but I don't follow any specific human religion, I sort of follow my own religion based on my dreams. I don't know if my recent dream was actually linked to the 11 people who just died in California or not, or maybe it was just a coincidence, but if it is then it suggests there is an afterlife after all so I hope that's what happened. There were other seemingly unrelated details in the dream too so maybe it's just a stretch, but I write this with hopes that the real God is real and good.

34,Dreams,Dreaming of humpback whales,"I keep dreaming of whales, sometimes killer whales, but more recently it's humpbacks. There is a smaller river where I live that feeds into a much larger river a few miles from the inlet (in Alaska). I dreamed I saw a humpback in the smaller river, so I ran down and followed it just so I could look at it (it was cool). It let me touch its head, and I ran beside it the whole way. In my dream there was a hill that isn't there in real life, and when I got to the top of the hill, I saw another whale waiting at the intersection of the two rivers, and they were so happy to see each other when my whale got there.

36,Dreams,Dreaming while awake,"Something really interesting happened to me yesterday. Usually, as I'm falling asleep, I first start hearing voices/sounds, then seeing very vague and blurry images, sort of like silhouettes in a fog. At that point, I fall asleep. But yesterday, I couldn't fall asleep. As I was lying in my bed, everything went just like normal. Vague sounds and blurry silhouettes, but then instead of directly falling asleep, I just kept getting closer and closer to falling asleep over a long period of time. And as I was getting closer, the sounds and images grew clearer. Toward the end, I could see everything as if I was looking at photos, extremely clear and colorful. I didn't try to control it either. Random photorealistic pictures and scenes appeared, just like a regular dream. My body was half disabled, if i tried to move a little bit i wouldn't move at all, and only when i tried a little harder would my fingers twitch instead of moving smoothly. But i felt extremely comfortable. I felt a lot of warmth, and my limbs gradually ""melted away"" almost as if they weren't there. The whole thing probably lasted about 30 minutes since i got to that state until i fell asleep. Do any of you have experience with something like that?

55,Dreams,Reaccuring Nightmare of jumping a bridge,"I'd like like some discussion or dream analysis done for what this could possibly mean if possible. I think I'll analyze this myself first really.

I've been having this dream for years now and it comes around every couple of months. Sometimes it's the same and sometimes it's different. There are certain things that stay constant and others that are variable. It's strange but I'm going to try to describe it as best as I can.

It always starts in a vehicle of some kind. In order, it's been a lift van, a bus, and lately an suv. In the early days of this dream it was my grandpa driving his lift van with me in the passenger seat. We were headed in the direction of Corpus Christy and there's this one long road that connects ""Corpus"" to the main land along that main road is a bridge because ""Corpus"" is an island. 

There were certain things that just are the way they are. Kinda like it really do just be like that or it is what it is kind vibe. 

This bridge is a socially acceptable bridge that people use frequently. It is a keep right back and forth bridge with no connection of road at the highest point. So imagine a ramp from either side that don't touch with a big distance for the jump.

Now I was 13-14 ish when this dream happened so I was absolutely terrified. We are going up this brdge which is rather huge. It's massiveness is comparable to the real life bridge in the actual Corpus Christy. My grandpa is giving me a pep talk about how we will make it and that vacation would be worth it or something important or fun was happening on the other side. There was no calming me down as the engine grew louder and the bridge grew steeper. I knew we were closer to the jump now and any second we would be flying into ther air.

So when the van inevitably jumped the bridge to make it to the other side, it was incredibly broken up road and boardwalk that we skidded across over open ocean until I woke up. That was the first time I've had the dream.

The second version of the dream involved my mother driving a school bus up the bridge. Actually making it but I can't see outside the windows because I'm not sitting up enough. My mom was a school bus driver so I think that's why it was a bus.

The latest dreams have been mom driving her suv. We have been able to make it though the dream always ends when I get to the other side or I don't remember much. I think there was one time when I was trying to get to the other side in my moms suv alone.

Any idea what any of this could mean? It's been piqueing my curiosity for a while now so I just had to get this out of my head and see what other people think.",1674491875.0

I do martial arts (jiu jitsu mainly), and the dreams where I don't run away, where I engage in social activity is when I'm doing martial arts in them. For example when I'm sparring or when I'm hanging out with my coaches/trainers. They talk to me about stuff and I engage.

So basically some guy broke into my house and i fought with him for a bit and I nicked him with a knife and remember being worried as it wouldn’t look like self defence. Somehow he gets a knife and hurts my dog. It gets fuzzy as to why I hurt her myself, but after he stabbed her and I think I done more damage to somehow stop the blood and I ended up taking a chunk or her face off?? Dreams are weird I know. But the damage I did had ruined the pet I love and she was now kinda ugly because of me and surprisingly she was alive, i felt massive relief, but I also felt really bad I did this and I felt so bad that I ended up decapitating the intruder and vaguely remember enjoying that part. At the end I realised I fucked up and tried to put the blame of my dog on him. Even though I took his head off in sheer anger, essentially proving my guilt.

Second, I asked, ""What career should I pursue?""

71,Dreams,I’ve always had very cohesive and realistic-ish dreams even when not so realistic things are going on. The one I just woke up from had my heart pounding.,"So, I was walking down a road by my house (I live in a relatively busy area) because I heard a ton of gunfire which was then followed by TONS of sirens for quite some time. When I reach the little shopping center, I can see a ton of cop cars along an intersecting road down in the distance. I see a teacher with a group of students and I ask her what happened and she wouldn’t give me a clear answer, but she looked pretty shaken up. The streets look messy with some type of liquid, honestly not sure what it was. There was a ton of people wandering around outside though since they also all heard everything going on.

Then, off in the distance, there’s just this massive explosion where you can see the fire/smoke go 40-50 feet up into the sky and that’s when the anxiety starts kicking in. Everyone’s confused for a few seconds and then we see this rocket ship taking off up into the sky and we’re like what the actual f**k? Then, elsewhere in the distance, we see this big spaceship type thing coming together super quickly and a few more rocket ships start streaking up into the sky and it’s super super loud and planes are flying erratically and then it hit me like, oh my god, all the rich/government/elite people are getting themselves off the planet.

People started looting the stores around me and were running through the streets with weapons and my heart was pounding knowing that something awful was happening. Then my alarm went off and woke me up. Not sure if it was aliens, or if the government just found out there was some massive asteroid approaching us or what 😂 But I’ll never forget that feeling of dread watching everything slowly get crazier and crazier. 

Figured I would share because it was the most realistic feeling and vivid dream I’ve had in quite some time and wanted to document it. My dreams have always fascinated me because it’s as if my mind knows a fully story completely unbeknownst to me that reveals itself slowly, like a movie. Is anyone else like this?

79,Dreams,One of my old dreams about this strange school,"So, i though i would share this dream because it always makes my eyes tear up and sends shivers down my spine.
Anyways, here it is:
I just arrived to this institution, it felt a lot like a middle school, the sky was grey and overcast, it was situated on a hill, with large hills and mountains surrounding this place,the forest surrounding it was somewhat dark. 
I remember an earlier dream about this place, it was a bit less weird and i will explain why later. 
So i came up to this building and it was just a regular white building, somewhat cubical as well with partial Austro-Hungarian architectural influence and some design aspects of Communist brutalist architecture. 
As i entered the building i started greeting people i knew. Straight ahead was a wide hall, but to my left was a wooden stairway with aluminum on every outer angle. That takes you to a second story which has another, tighter stairway made of tiles, and then that takes you to a third, after that you have an extremely tight stairway which is only 1 meter wide and it takes you to this dark place with rooms. Though i did not dwell a lot there, but people were coming in and out of them occasionally. Mostly girls which i found strange. But the focus of my dream was on the first floor. In my first dream i remember there being doors when you turn left in the great hall and go to this elevated ground, i even remember that i broke inside the first time. But i forgot what was inside. 
But this time the doors did not exist. Instead i saw another door right next to those, just in a corner wall on the other side of this elevated part of the great hall. I entered those fancy doors, they were red and had golden details upon them. The hall i came into was much the same, red painted walls, red carpets embrobied with golden threads,golden lamps, red tables with golden ornaments. You get the picture. 
The people that lived there had red eyes and spiky teeth. They actually took me prisoner and put me in a room. I managed to break out and as i was exploring this place i came upon an altar of sorts with a golden object that resembled one of those ""cups"" you get when you win competitions, and a red gem necklace that resembled a penticle, or a pentagram. I grabbed these two objects and i escaped that place, once i got back to that school like place, the doors disappeared behind me. 
The classes were over and so i hopped into my car and started driving down that mountain road. One of my ""friends"" (i don't know this person irl btw) was hitchhiking so i picked him up. And as we were driving further the sky started losing that grey  shade and clouds started disappearing. Then an old woman started walking across the road and as she came up to the middle she turned into a puff of smoke and that smoke created a vortex that dispersed that smoke. 
After that the sky regained it's dark gray hue and i stopped after a while to take a look at my dashcam to see what that was. But i couldn't turn on the device. It would make the noise as i would press the buttons but the screen just wouldn't turn on. 
Then i started driving further and as i did so i woke up. 
If i get a lucid dream, i will probably try to find that place again. I know it's in the southeast from the central location.",1674473239.0
80,Dreams,Had a black mirror style dream that creeped me the f out at 4.30am,"I signed up for a tech trial with load of people but people ducked out as the process went on until eventually we got to the last 6 or so people. We had been using headsets to learn how to perform these specific actions in the virtual world for the entire trial but they eventually switched over and put a chip in our brains. We could learn things fast and eventually once mastered control the world around us with our minds much like in the virtual world we had been practicing in. The aim it seemed was to tap into an inate human ability to use telekinesis. We didn't fully get the whole story though and it started to feel unsafe. Some people started to feel scared.of everything that was going on but when they tried to run away they had their minds wiped and that caused brain damage, so every now and then after a conversation with a very scared person you would find them on the floor braindead. There were three lesbians in the group, me another woman and then one of the company leaders. Over time it had been made clear that there was a purpose to where had been chosen for the study and it was entirely selfish. The company leaders were building a world around them of people and each of them chose multiple possible love matches to ensure that they could live out their lives with some form of family dynamic, but where they were with other people with the same abilities. Me and the other lesbian were feeling unsure of it all. Her more than me. Eventually she tried leaving, as she ran passed a certain point in the surrounding area it was like a switch went off in her head and she just dropped to the ground. I watched it happen as she ran i was so afraid. I went to talk to the leaders about it as i felt that maybe the reason it was happening this way was because people were running rather than asking to leave. No one had discussed the possibility of leaving but people felt so afraid that they didn't ask they just ran. This discussion was when I found out about the love matches and the idea of this new society they were building, they told me I had a choice and they would remove my chip if i needed without the brain wipe. But then the remaining lesbian started flirting with me and i was lonely and she was hot to I fell for it and I suddenly didn't feel so keen to leave. She told me she didn't want me to leave and explained with a diagram of these different stages in people's lives and that some people will achieve great things in their own right and some people will achieve middle level and be happy but that some people give up their mid level lives to live their life with a successful partner who would achieve greatness. Some people are the ones in the background supporting and making a difference that way. Suddenly staying made sense because staying with her would give me a better life, I wasn't destined for great things in the outside world but with her by my side i could be part of something ground breaking and i could be happ. We spent an amazing night together and it turned out she had actually liked me all along, but the pairing off was managed by the CEO who set aside backup options for partners. The next morning I woke up and I was alone. I felt betrayed by her, that we had this amazing night and then she would just leave. But then i noticed something. I couldn't do anything like i used to with the chip, i had lost my abilities. I hadn't agreed to removing the chip and suddenly this future i had decided on was crashing down around me. Then a cat walked in. One of the abilities we all would eventually master was transformation into animals. my partner had been the only person who had mastered it and this cat looked like her. Only she was a nervous cat. She obviously had a faint memory that she knew me and trusted me but she was so afraid . I went to see the cat as she cowered in a corner but she had chosen to come to my room and she wanted to be near me even if still scared. something was seriously wrong. Everywhere was eerily quiet, everyone seemed to have left. Suddenly it dawned on me that maybe everyone had forgotten. I couldn't explain it but I just knew that someone had sabotaged everything. They had been wiped but for some reason it hadn't effected me. They had wiped the whole development team including the founder. And they had wiped my partner while she was a cat. Everyone. I picked up the cat and got in my car and finally ran for my life. I knew where the world would eventually reach in the future and i knew the people who had the brains to create it but most of them now had some form of dementia and everyone else couldn't figure out where they were even of they were still intelligent. Regardless, I was a loose end that no one realised existed and it wasn't safe for me to be found out. And if i told people i would sound mad. So finally I accepting my life and I just ran. Settling down with my dream partner, but she was a cat now. And nothing would ever be the same for me.",1674471409.0
81,Dreams,Had two reccuring dreams in the same night,"So these dreams are recurring, but they are also continued off of the last time I had them. My dream self remembers them happening.

One was me on a beach and these giant waves towering above everyone, appearing as soon as I get in the water and you have to run out of the water or you'll likely die. Dream me even shouted, ""why do these waves always happen to me???"" Then we ran and tried to get other people out of the water.

Then the dream shifted and I was in a house and a friend also from a previous dream was mad at me for ghosting him (in the last dream), I try to apologize but he still gets mad and storms off. Also the friend doesn't exist in real life, they're only a friend in my dream.

84,Dreams,I had a dream about a orange dragon and yellow frog,"Hi everyone,

I was wondering if anyone had any similar experience or know anything about certain animals and objects in dreams.

I had a dream two days ago where I was standing in my childhood home looking out of the backside of the house (The whole wall is glass). Outside there was an orange dragon? (no arms or legs like a snake, but the head was a dragon) lying on a bended tree. Then come a big yellow frog, a trigram of 3 black lines (Search Trigram Qian on Google for the exact pattern) covering all of its back. The frog then jumps on the dragon and rides it away. I look away for a moment, and when I look back outside the dragon is flying right towards me and I wake up.

I can't stop thinking about the dream every since. I am in a WTF state. Anyone experienced something similar?

Cheers.",1674464165.0

86,Dreams,Pregnancy in dreams meaning?,"Okay so I've had two dreams where I was pregnant in a relatively short amount of time. This is weird since I'm a dude and I have no desire to get pregnant.

Last night I dreamed that I was unexpectedly pregnant from a on-night stand. This caused me a lot of stress. After a while my subconscious forgot about that storyline and I did some cool magic shit instead.

A few nights ago I dreamed I was pregnant but in the strangest way. It wasn't really my baby. It was an embryo that was implanted into my belly to grow there. My dream partner (I'm single in real life) tried to abort the baby without my knowledge of permission and I had to escape him.

87,Dreams,I had a dream where my mom killed herself,"Literally moments ago I woke up from such a surreal dream

&amp;#x200B;

For some context, I’m a teenager and I got removed from my mom’s house and sent to live with my grandma 2 years ago. I was suicidal and so was my mom. I have had heard the news before that she’s attempted.

&amp;#x200B;

So in my dream. It was 11:30pm and I was watching tv on the couch with my grandma. We were both laughing and having fun and I was looking at her before I felt my phone vibrate. I looked to see who was calling me and it was my stepdad. I don’t remember putting his phone number as a contact so I thought this was weird. I got a glance at the time saying 11:30pm and instantly my heart dropped. I knew this wasn’t good. I answered the phone and he sounded fine. We did small talk and I let myself calm down, but then I hear this. “OP, are you listening? Look, your ‘brother’ and I, we know and understand a little more than you do right now…” and instantly his voice and everything around me turned to slow motion. “Your mom killed herself.” 

&amp;#x200B;

And instantly like it was a science reaction my body cramped up inti a cradling position and I couldn’t move. I dropped my phone next to my and bawled. I could hear my stepdad talking through the phone but I was trying to free myself. My body kept cramping and I kept crying. All of a sudden I’m free and I run into my grandmams room and tell her before falling on the floor. She said she knew. In disbelief I run into the living room to see all the lights are turned off, but I hear someone walking down the hall from where the front door is. Knowing the time, this is when my grandpa comes home from work, so I run up to him and tell him everything. He says he also knows, and that she had HUNG HERSELF. (My mom’s first attempt at suicide was hanging)I cried even more hearing this and seeing that he had no reaction. He tried to hug me but I slipped out of his touch and ran to my room. Before I turned on the lights, I saw her. He neck was stretched out, not super long, but maybe 2 feet tall. It was also mangled. She was a dark grey color, but I refused to look too long at her face, so it didn’t register what she looked like. I turned around before forcing myself to wake up fully. I was already starting to wake up so I was able to. 

&amp;#x200B;

It’s 2:23 a.m. as I finish writing this. I’m too scared to go back to sleep as I feel like something is here with me. Does this dream mean anything. Is that reaction the same as when someone you know dies? I had gruesome dreams before but none like this. The nights before were only happy dreams. Yes, I dream every night and I’m also on sleeping medication. Melatonin and trazodone. Does this mean anything. I just want answers and to soothe myself back to sleep. It’s so scary.",1674462494.0
88,Dreams,Dreamt about death. Quite unsettled,"So, this is kind of going to be a long post, but i hope people read it all to understand why im so unsettled. To start, I quit smoking weed 3 weeks ago and also a couple weeks ago started an antipsychotic(bipolar disorder) that also creates vivid dreams. So, needless to say very vivid(and actually meaningful dreams that I know the meaning of) dreams recently.

But basically, in this dream, my grandma basically asked us for assisted suicide, she got it and we were sitting around waiting for her to die of this poison she was given, and having family visit, basically, quite peaceful actually. Now, why I am so unsettled is due to this:

I dreamt about death(in a different context, actually in the context of my dad who was ACTUALLY in a coma, nearly dying, didn't actually get the answer of if he did in the dream, real bizarre death.) Now the part that is unsettling is- my dad has attempted suicide before. I got a call later that day. Real life. My friend killed himself. Had to have been near when I was dreaming within hours.

I can't remember the dream I had around then, but I know I could sense while I was asleep that my grandma's dog had died. Woke up to the news. I just said ""I know"" to my mom. My mom knows about the prior dream. This was maybe 6 months ago.

I can't remember for sure, but I think I dreamt about death when my ex step dad's daughter died a couple weeks ago.

I dreamt a lot as a kid about many tornados around me. Well, back to real life, in that house, I witnessed a funnel cloud right above me, with the air spinning around me. Was terrifying. I witnessed something like 4 funnels in that state near me. 2 very close tornados, within 15 miles of me, in the last year I was there. Including one time while I was tripping on acid. That was fun. The dreams started first. I no longer live in a tornado prone area.

Needless to say, I have had very litteral predictive dreams so I am very unsettled. My most vivid dreams have been predictive. My grandma is certainly getting old and will die soon, how soon, could be a few years, but I knew her dog was going to die soon too. I have accepted this. 

But it isn't just the dream. I feel something is off. I sense death. I have gotten good at identifying the sense. Runs in the family i guess, I remember when I was young my family knew the day my grandpa was going to die. I can identify it pretty perfectly from the real signs. So much death in my life. Tis life though. Just unnerved since if it is litteral, I cannot identify the person or creature at this time.

I probally sound crazy now",1674461053.0
89,Dreams,Our dreams have deeper meaning?,"Im one of those people who have had vivid/lucid dreams all my life, and have been able to remember all of my dreams.
Dreams are profound and are generally accepted as representations of the subconscious mind, though some cultures and individuals regard dreams as divine/spiritual/supernatural messages. I feel like everyone has had someone tell them of a profound dream that entailed a message about the future, or a communication with a deceased relative. Dreams are just one of those things that we'll never have concrete explanations for.


The last dream I had, I was being chased by 2 alligators that were sent after me by 2 people who were observing the whole situation from a distance. I started in some water, and swam onto land, and finally climed up a tree, where the aligators still managed to climb up after me. In my dream, I literally realized, alligators aren't even able to climb trees. Yet here I was in a tree with two gators not far behind in the tree. One got close to me, so I kicked it off of the tree and watched it fall. When it hit the ground, it morphed into a man. The man walked over to the other men who were observing. I got the sense that these people were in control of this situation. One gator was still coming up the tree after me, but it wasn't that close yet. I realized I was dreaming at this point. I yelled down to the men and I asked ""do you want me to jump?"" because i didnt know any other reason they would send gators after me up a tree. I recognized that the only options they intended for me were to get eaten, or jump from the tree. When i asked, the men seemed stunned. They didnt answer me, they just looked at me. I asked again, ""Do you want me to jump?"" no one answered, they just looked like they weren't expecting me to ask them anything. I woke up after that.


My life has been exceptionally challenging filled with traumatic events. Recently I've been having suicidal ideations. I'm not someone who has concrete spiritual beliefs, but as far as they go, I feel like if there is a higher power with influence over our lives, then it definitely ""wanted"" me to delete myself. With everything that has happened in my life, if there is a higher power, me doing the deed would be an appropriate ending to my life. It would ""make sense"". Any thoughts?",1674460700.0
90,Dreams,I don't know,"Sorry if there's typos. I've been putting off downloading Reddit for awhile this is my first post I've ever written and it will probably be the last. It is 2:06am and I've been up for about an hour now I'm very tired. 

Okay so for context I've(f) been having horrible nightmares since I was 6 all of my dreams are in third person and i have had experiences with not only lucid dreaming but also sleep paralysis. But this dream is wrong and everything that came after is wrong.

It started off kinda normal or as normal as dreams can be except it was in first person. I was at my boyfriends house (we've been together for 7 months now) and everything felt off. I dont know how to explain it but it was wrong just little stuff tho like having more dogs than he has or the house lay out being weird. Then I couldn't find him I looked everywhere and it was getting late i needed to get home then the dogs where all over me laying ontop me and I couldn't move then i was at my cousins house on her porch which wasn't odd because i spend a lot of time there. (More context a few days ago i had a dream that me and my younger sister were standing on her porch talking and she got attacked by a man in a hood but she fought him off but after she said ""he was testing me he said i always need to be prepared"") we were standing on the porch and her husky was in the yard i was talking to him from the porch when i turned to see a hooded figure standing at the bottom of the steps.  I said out loud ""hey (cousins name) who's the man with the hood"" then he dropped dropped a bunch of cans of spray paint and charged towards me he stuck out his arm and grabbed me by the throat slamming me down aginst the porch his other hand held my hands down above my head my vision went blurry and I couldn't hear anything i was struggling but he had my spine bent in a weird way so it didnt do much i seen his fave he was bald and had long scars across his face he kept trying to speak to me but I couldn't hear him bc i had headphones in ( i guess) i was trying to reach them but i couldn't move or breathe i yelled and told him i couldnt hear him and he kept repeating himself but i just couldn't hear.

I woke up after a few seconds of being there my whole body felt numb in a weird way. (I slept in the floor which isn't uncommon for me) i looked up at the  large dresser i have in the corner of my room and it looked like a woman was hunched over in a weird way looking at herself in the mirror and all around me looked like people- ish things where around me. It was all black. Now. I know i sound crazy but this didn't feel like sleep paralysis ik the difference. Around this time i realized my arms where still above my bead holding my own wrists down I slid my arms down to my sides blinking  hard after the second blink everything was gone. Im now laying on the couch in the living room with all the lights on. Im used to nightmares and weird things happening after but this just felt off. I don't know I'm gonna try to get some sleep.",1674460001.0
91,Dreams,A seemingly important dream I can't interpret,"I had this dream I'm having trouble cracking open. I can tell it's about family, inheritance, and there's even a touch of some Pinocchio symbolism, but I can't figure out much more. Maybe someone here can help? Here is the dream:

&gt;I drove to a small village located on the edge of a cliff. I was looking for somewhere to park my car and the parking lot by the main road was full, so I drove off road onto a rocky path that led down and very close to the edge. There was another parking lot on a very rocky terrain, so I parked there. I then climbed back into the village. It was a regular village, except there were two very large, very rich houses there. One was older, and the other newer. The older one had very old trees growing in its yard. The trees were planted by the family that lived there. They were crooked and many of them seemed to be dead, or dying. The newer one didn't have trees in the yard. It belonged to the family descended from the old family of the older house.  
&gt;  
&gt;The wooded yard of the older house was open to the public for viewing. It was forbidden to chop down any tree. However, there was one guy walking around with a chainsaw, seemingly looking at which tree to tear down. I saw other people telling him, some calmly, some screaming at him, that he was not allowed to do this. He then put down his chainsaw, leaned against a tree, and he looked to be meditating - his eyes closed, and the tips of his index finger and thumb joined on each hand.  
&gt;  
&gt;I told him not to chop down any tree as he was not allowed, because it seemed to me he had not heard anyone. I insisted on him giving a response, which he did eventually, promising he wouldn't do it. And then I left back to my car.  
&gt;  
&gt;Then, someone stopped all visitors from leaving. Everyone was required to come back to the yard of the old house and pick up the pieces of the tree that man had chopped down regardless of his promise. There were pieces of wood everywhere, as if he'd chopped down multiple trees. I picked up some chopped up parts of the trunk of what looked to be an acacia tree. The tree looked to have been dead before it was chopped down as it was dry and browning. I picked up as much as I could, then carried it away. Then I was told to bring it into the yard of the newer house belonging to the descendants. I carried it there. The yard was decorated in a pretty way with fountains, and pebbled paths. It had the main part, just behind the house which had the fountain and the pebbled path all around it, like a roundabout. Then from that a couple of steps led up to an elevated area which was covered with grass and some decorative shrubbery. The woods I was carrying was no longer woods. I was now carrying my older son, and I set him down on the soft, warm grass to sleep.  
&gt;  
&gt;I told him to rest while I help pick up the rest of the trees that man had chopped down. I mentioned also a shower for some reason and then as I descended to the level with a fountain, sprinklers suddenly came on and started spraying water all around. I jumped back up to my son and said ""Sorry, that's not what I meant!"" I picked him back up and his pajamas were already soaked. I led him back out of the yard as the sprinklers were sprinkling warm water, I'd assumed because the hoses leading to the sprinklers had been exposed to the warm sun all day. We went towards the car so he wouldn't be cold as dark was slowly creeping in.

About this dream I feel a sense of peace, and calm. The main reason I tell the man with the chainsaw not to chop down any tree is because I don't want him to get into trouble, not because I care one way or another about the trees. In the end when the sprinklers come on I feel the most animated as I find the situation funny even as I care that my son isn't out and about in wet pajamas.

There is a sense that the descendants who live in the newer house would inherit the entire old estate, including the trees. For this reason I see the trees as representing some deeply rooted ideas, maybe traditions, which have been planted by the ancestors for the descendants to keep them going. The guy with the chainsaw is then some agent of discernment of which of these ideas and traditions are worth keeping and him meditating before tearing down just any tree seems to suggest a degree of mindfulness about what he's doing.

This is about as deep as I can get in analyzing this dream. Any further ideas on the symbolism here is much appreciated.",1674458227.0

The second one was even more intense. It was a dream in a dream. In the inner dream, I was assisting in on a surgery. I’ve been watching a medical drama so this isn’t that weird lol. However, the operating theatre was haunted and I saw shadow figures and my colleague was shrinking?? Anyway, when I thought I had woken up, in the outer dream I was in my room.

How do you cope with this?,"Every night for the past few months I wake up several times during the night because of my dreams. My partner says sometimes I wake him up from crying loudly and shaking. I barely wake up when this happens like it happen so fast and I just fall back asleep. I have multiple bad dreams a night. I wouldn't call them nightmares because they're not scary but they're related to trauma I've experienced so scary in a way, very emotional but not terrifying. Sometimes my dreams are so vivid, I wake up and can't tell the difference between what was real and a dream. This has been affecting me terribly because I'm a school bus driver. I need restful sleep to do my job and some days I have to take a nap between shifts or I feel like I'd be a danger driving so tired. I see my psych nurse soon and I think I should ask for something for sleep. Does anyone take anything besides melatonin for sleep that helps?

Interesting. I go down and it's run by a whole a*s bishop, with the pointy napkin hat and everything. He says I should join his church because there's a chess tournament at the end of every service. I join immediately by way of elaborate holy ceremony involving animal sacrafice, incense, holy oil, bathing, etc. And then as soon as I'm done I play some chess with a girl and she said all she needs in a man is for him to be a good cook, and good at chess. So we went home together and went right back to church the next day after a night of me making her some kind of scallop dish, I forget. Anyway that day at the chess tournament Magnus Carlson joined and we played each other.

106,Dreams,"This old, recurring dream where we find underground ruins [long]","It starts on the river where I used to go tubing with friends when I was younger. See, there's this one place upstream from the start of where you can tube that's next to this old hydroelectric power plant, and next to it there's a small waterfall and a kind of two-tiered river for a little bit. anyway in my dream there's a kind of second waterfall hidden behind the first one that drops deeply and then opens into a cave. At first it seems like a normal cave with a natural pool in it, no more unique than lots of others that you might see on nature documentaries. But in some of my subsequent dreams of this same place, I explored it further and deeper in it there was this squeeze where you had to move rocks aside and resist the flowing water and scrunch up or contort yourself to get to the other side of that led deeper down into this deeper cave system.

At first it's no more than a long winding tube-shaped rocky shaft with some flowing water along the floor of it. So I followed the flowing water further down for a while and at this point it becomes more of a near-vertical shaft that I'm still able to step/climb down since it's made of larger jagged rocks that don't loosen and slide or wet enough to allow me to slip. Fascinated by the water like it's leading us somewhere (also in my dream a handful of friends sometimes come with me), we press on, continuing our descent until we come to a kind of stone staircase off to one side of the natural shaft, and where the shaft continues at a much smaller size to where only the water can continue to flow down.

I'm naturally pretty surprised and excited to find this staircase that someone created this deep underground and out of the rock itself, like megalithic architecture, so I continue to see where it leads. Then I come upon this incredibly wide open space, kind of like what in my mind's eye is an ancient Greek city, with columned temples on a hill way off in the background and stone-cobbled streets before me. I should mention here that there is a sky above us, not blue like ours but a kind of shimmering-sparkling black with white stars that are alive and moving and turning off and on. This makes the ambient light conditions similar to indoors - enough to not be a struggle to see, but not overly bright. It feels weird because we're so deep underground that there shouldn't be this vast landscape before us, but here it is anyway. The city is empty though, like everyone just vanished without a trace. There's no sign of any physical calamity that would've wiped them out and or skeletal or other remains. Nothing would indicate the past presence of intelligent people having lived here before, except for the familiar architecture and street-side shops and the like.

My friends and I continue along this one street-path before us, looking at the shop stalls and the pottery they have for sale as we pass them. The distant temple on the hill creeps slowly by as we walk, indicating it lies at least a mile or two away. Behind it are still more rolling hills and an unexpectedly pastoral landscape, with trees and greenery and what might be vineyards scattered among the distant hillsides. We continue walking until we come to an amphitheater-type location, round with a sunken floor and with some characteristics like a gazebo, with a lowered ceiling toward the outer edge that is more lifted toward the middle - off to the right of the road. The center of the ceiling is obscured and the inside of this area is darker so that we couldn't see what was inside the amphitheater. Curious, we decide to explore inside.

We descend the few steps to enter this gazebo-like amphitheater area and look around to find several reclining workstation chairs made of something like bronze or gold that are very ornate and technical-looking, with lots of inputs and outputs for any user who might sit in one. Then our eyes are drawn up to see what the seated user might see if they sat in the reclined seat and looked ""foward""/up toward the center of the ceiling. There we see a whirling mass of electricity and lightning that was ultra-active with shooting pulsating discharges but it was deceptively quiet – not silent but sort of unnaturally muffled.  A weird compulsion to take a seat and hook ourselves into each of the techno-workstation chair things comes over us all at once, like something is saying, ""it's okay, you can join us"".

As I take my seat and secure my legs and hips in and then lean back to get my chest and arms secured and put my helmet on, I see in my peripheral vision others doing the same. Each of them in turn are being transformed into a brilliant blue-white light that ascends through the helmet to join the swirling form of intense electrical activity which I could feel was a sort of collective consciousness there at the upper part of the center of the room. Where the beings that created this place residing in it? Did they make this metamorphosis possible through some high technology? How long ago did this happen? I feel scared that my friends are physically gone but also excitement, almost inspiration, to think that there is another existence they are headed to and that I am about to undertake the same journey. Peacefully ready to experience what awaits, I close my eyes, don my helmet and...

108,Dreams,my dreams have been.. very interesting lately to say the least,"i’ll start off with the one i had last night then add in the comments about my others

I was in my house that i’ve grown up in, living with multiple other women and girls seemingly to be around the same age. The youngest girl was probably around 19 or 20 (i’m 22) and the oldest maybe 25. Michael the architect from the series The Good Place was there and I found out he had actually kidnapped all of us and forced us to marry him :,) i remember kissing his ass to avoid any trouble, and finding out that he actually got the youngest girl pregnant which infuriated me. I remember feeling disgust and talking to her about how what he was doing was wrong, and she had been completely brainwashed saying that she was in love with him and what he did was okay. Then I look out the back door and the three witches from Hocus Pocus were dancing in the woods behind my house, then i made fun of the girl for her foundation shade not matching her skin tone properly because i was mad she was siding with our kidnapper… then i woke up. i have no idea what is going on lmao more in the comments 😌",1674444110.0

It felt like I was amongst demons, they looked like people and worst part is even though every interaction felt normal it was actually just a game where there was a breaking point or climax that would ultimately lead to your death. My little brother was there with me and for some reason in each interaction he'd just disappear and reappear whenever the ""game"" was over.

110,Dreams,Dream +5,"Dream was me walking towards a set of L shaped stairs with a view of outside blocked by window panels in a university, tons of people were on those stairs and I just got told to go retrieve an item from downstairs. I was making my way down and everyone turned to congratulate me, me wondering why I proceeded on I got to the first flight of stairs, all I saw was black at the base of the stairs couldn’t see the floor and there was no visable light coming from the base of the stairs also after the first flight I was greeted by my dog smiley. Started calling him smiley because he always smiles every time after we pet him. He was with another dog I didn’t know but came with me down the stairs we got to the base of the stairs, I could see I was in a dark hallway no light on either side in front of me There was a break room looking area it had vending machines a coffee machine UV glow sticks in each corner of the room which lit up the room very brightly and both entrances had window door frames, I also noticed a man with a hoodie and has his back turned to it all, I seen a cat in the room approach him and my first instincts was to ask “sir…. Sir?… are you ok?” Waited a few seconds and slowly approached him to tap him on the shoulder. My dog smiley jumped on my chest and pushed me back while the other dog took guard position. I look down at smiley and looked back up when I heard broken glass move, he was gone but left behind a blood trail of where the cat approached him leading right down the hallway into the darkness. When I seen the blood trail I turned around was going to book it back up the stairs but before I moved I seen a whisp dash right to left down the hallway and smiley again jumped on my chest pushing me back onto a chair. He then jumped onto my legs and slowly changed from a dog to a cat much like those old animorphs book I used to like looking at as a kid. After he changed he dug His claws into my leg not enough to hurt but dig himself in He was then rotating his head back and forth between the front and back door with his ears perched up like he’s listening for a sound or movement. While he was doing that I was thinking what this creature could be I had thought it was a vampire, (hates UV lights is nocturnal) would a cross hurt it? garlic, silver. Then it occurred to me what if a zombie from dying light where these creatures only show up at night hates UV light. But just then my cat once a dog was looking at where the blood trail was and I seen his right ear perk up and he slowly turned to the door and started hissing getting mad like a cat does I slowly turned my head towards the door and as I seen the door I shot awake in my bed and the dream was over.",1674440728.0

112,Dreams,"Hello, my name is M.A. Galarce. I am a Medium, an intermediary between this plane and the one we usually call Beyond"," 

I'm not the typical medium you see on TV.

I am something different, I show different things. A different angle. My area of ​​interest or work is dreams and the time line. It cost me a lot to get acquainted with mediums in general because I didn't see much of a relationship. One usually compares notes and sees that we agree and that we don't. And I only found a colleague in the US which if we had something... we both knew the golds. Well, in my case, I saw them and interacted with them. In his case, they told him they looked like The Golden Ones. Of that color. I compare them to an old 80s movie called Cocoon.

So I said, well... I'm not the only one. Well then, the history of humanity names them in some way always somewhere in the world. The pre-Columbian town of Colombia where the famous story of El Dorado was born, Cundinamarca, is one of the most obvious cases.

You can see Shakira with her Tour called El Dorado. It is a clear example. Another example that can be seen visually and is also current is with the artist Kylie Minogue. When I wrote my first novel called Black Bubbles: Los Dorados, I knew it would be difficult for me to prove that they exist, but they answered me through this famous artist. The suicidal blonde. Shortly after posting, she released an album and a song called Golden. In his song titled the same way, he says something like ""We are Golden, golden, that's what we are.""

And speaking of black bubbles, this is how we call dreams where contacts are made and we connect to the time line... we have their song I Beliebe in You. Where she can be seen dancing in a Bubble and when it starts to work, she changes her clothes for one with gold and purple details. And some entities become visible around her to dance with her.

This could be inconsequential, but time has given us the go-ahead by establishing contact through dreams. Validating connections with future events. And I use social networks to publish the crystallized dreams, giving them a certain date and time. For later, when the fact occurs, it usually happens in a few hours, or one to three days. Then yes, there are cases that have been going on for a month, a month and a half. There are even dreams that anticipate events several years in advance. It happens that in order for you to validate it, I need the times not to be so long. But yes, we managed to demonstrate that we have an intimate relationship with the time line and that there are entities, that we would be ourselves when we leave this biological body, that contact each other and draw dreams to establish a connection. It usually happens that they do it all the time, but humanity is barely aware of it. He suspects it, but can't confirm it. With my work, we already confirmed it.

It happens, for example, that artists such as writers and singers anticipate the events of their death, the end of their path, in a song or in a book.

It occurs more in singers... and it is very clear, that is why we say that dreams anticipate future events that are going to happen within a year, 5, 10, 15 or more. Freddie Mercury wrote a song about 16 years in advance. There is an Argentine singer who was also around 15 years old and then wrote another one about 4 years before that clarified the panorama. ""I am a stone in the dry water inside"" he said. She used my head like a gun. I stay here. Two songs that anticipated the facts. A cerebrovascular accident left him in a coma, he did not die, he was in that state for 4 years. Then I left. That's why I stay here. It sounds scary, but when we die, we are left in a kind of black bubble, which is similar to a dream. A suspended space, a room, a small world, a limbo... for a few days until we make the transition from human to being multidimensional. And it happens that they can connect again with this plane through someone's dreams, lately, in mine. My black bubble receives people because I am paying attention, writing down everything.

And there are cases where they tell you their story in pieces, in different dreams. They are presented without giving much detail, the details are their surroundings or the little they say. It's not a human dialogue let's say, it's all together. A language of 5 dimensions.

6 months before, 10 days before, or one month before your death, depending on the case.

There was a singer last year who died in a motorcycle accident. His connection with us consisted of 2 steps in a dream. He approached us and told us that he was worried about life after death, he didn't really know what was there, and one comforted him as best he could. He told me, I have a month to live. Immediately afterwards, I was on a motorcycle, always in the first person, I was circulating and I found myself with a very high cordon that I could not climb. Behind me, a car and another motorcycle came and they got on it. About 24 days later, a young singer similar to the one in the dream had an accident. He was going fast and on one wheel and he crashed into a car. His head, without a helmet, hit the cord. So I said, in a few days it will be a month. If he dies, it's him. Exactly a month later, he was declared brain dead. The next day he died.

An exact month.

And so we have a contact from time to time. Or something that is going to happen soon.

And I try to show the world my work because I don't want to die without someone learning about it, so I can move on. Imagine it's just me right now, but the more you learn the subject, the more black bubbles open for contact will exist.

That's why I'm writing this now. I work in the diffusion of the topic and I do everything by lung because I don't have help of any kind.

Well, thanks for reading and paying attention. Any questions I am at your disposal.

114,Dreams,I had a dream that fell in love a stranger who was some sort YouTube let’s player.,I’ve really had dream where I fell in love with a stranger before. It was very odd in dream I helped me make a rom hack for a old retro game. It ended up becoming a retro style game of it’s own. So I basically made video game for her. however I don’t know how to any of that irl. I can’t remember what else I did with her in the dream but I feel like I loved her I get a warm fuzzy feeling when I think about it. I don’t even quite remember what she even looked like. The dream took place in the town my Grandparents live and for reason in the dream I lived there she also did. I don’t recall ever seeing in real life there in that town. I remember this dream every once in a while and I look back on it fondly. I’m not quite sure what this dream even means I would love to hear some different takes on it. I would like to know what was the meaning behind this dream.,1674439758.0
115,Dreams,Dating,"Today is my second day having a dream after long time and it was mainly about random guys who I have been “dating”, ignoring me and leaving me without any closure or reasons. Yesterday dream, I was ignored and today one, I was dating this guy but we weren’t in relationship yet. However, he chose to break it off without any reason and I was furious and upset about it and I woke up. 
Having these dreams, I do not know the exact reason or cause of it but when I search it up it says fear of losing someone, being alone, anxieties etc. I am seeing someone for awhile now and it’s the longest guy I’ve dated. The past ones always left me with one-sided feelings , left me with no closure , we never were officially, just dating but one A-hole had audacity to introduce me to his friends as ‘girlfriend’ and later got distant by himself while I was trying my best to figure it out why he was acting like that. 
With this one, he is someone i thought I would never date because of our past history when we used to work in same place. He is a different person outside of workplace, completely a sweetheart and my goofball.
 Waking up today with this dream, I felt numb and broken. Maybe I had these due to my past experiences, I started to be cautious when I see someone else approach me cause I’m afraid of being abandoned and used. I’m more of a relationship type rather than casual one and so is the guy I’m seeing right now. I want good things to happen between us and if one of us ever to leave , better to leave with closure.

They’re not just about that, the dreams are just me doing my things, going to work, visiting family ecc… but every time it seems like I’m slowly going moon/zero gravity and starting to float with every step I take.

It can be fun at the beginning, it seems to be faster and effortless to move (I’m not 100% weightless, I manage to slowly get back down, like a 10/20% moon gravity I’d say)

But it always becomes annoying pretty fast, I’m walking (more like jumping) around and I can’t make turns, it’s pretty hard to nail directions, aim through doors, I’m inside buildings and have to “crawl” through corridors with my hands.

My feet always want to go up and make me float and slowly spin around like a spaceship.

Note: everyone else isn’t affected by this and doesn’t seems to notice or be bothered/concerned by my “condition”

121,Dreams,Sith Lord Meditation and A Nightmare About Elbow Wounds and Spiders,"Please help me interpret this! 

I had a nightmare last night while listening to sith lord meditation music throughout the night. In the dream I was sleeping in a weird position so when I woke up my elbows were aching. Instead of getting better, the aching got gradually worse until my elbows were red and inflamed. My first thought was ""Oh that's not right. I should get that checked out."" but then I instantly forgot about it and decided I wanted a mixed drink of eggnog and milk. My step mom came home (it was one of my old houses, not where I currently live) and she saw the problem with my elbows while I was pooring eggnog into a glass. 

She asked me what happened and I told her I just slept in a funny position. I looked at my arms again to check them out and found that scabs had formed on the protruding bones of my elbows. My step mom instantly drove me to a doctor. The doctor practiced at a luxury tropical resort for some reason. When we got out of the and walked across a parking lot, my wounds on my elbows started bleeding. My step mom urged me to walk faster, so I did while trying to stop the bleeding, but the wounds kept gradually getting worse. When we got to the front doors, one of my wound ripped open all the way across my forearm. 

My step mom cussed. I cussed. We rushed to the front desk to ask to see the doctor. The receptionist was way too calm and asked us to check in because ""it wasn't an emergency hospital it was a Best Western."" My step mom had a fit but checked in anyway because I was bleeding everywhere and trying my best to apply pressure and keep the wound on my arm closed. The doctor came out immediately and asked up to come back to a room with him. He sat me down and instead of tending to my elbows and my arm, he did a psych evaluation. I was confused by this for a moment but at that moment I was distracted by some light tingling in my arms. 

The light tingling turned gradually into heavier tingling. It was bothering me so I looked down and found a bunch of tiny bumps crawling around in my skin. The bumps escaped my wounds and I realized the bumps were a ton of spiders. The spiders crawled all over me and more and more came out of my arms. The amount increased over time. I stayed frozen out of fear that they would bite me. Eventually they started crawling out of my eyes, nose, mouth and ears also. No one seamed to notice. My step mom was staring into space and the doctor was writing notes. Eventually there were no more spiders and they all crawled away into the void. O was still frozen for some seconds until I twitched and took that as my queue to move. So I did and I instantly looked down at my arms to see if any spiders bit me. I found bite marks all over and my previous wounds vanished.

123,Dreams,The most terrifying nightmare I've had in a while,"TW: Pedophilia, Stalking, Murder, Implied Suicide, Implied/Referenced Rape/Non-con

I'm not the protagonist of this terrifying story. Rather, it's the story of a young girl in her high school years, probably about fourteen years old. She had blonde hair, which she had acquired from both of her parents. 

One day, she was struggling to find a ride home from school. It looked like the taxis were full, and there was no bus on sight. She then came across a police detective who was scolding her classmates about their poor waste disposal. As far as she could tell, he seemed like a nice guy. Seeing how she was struggling to find a way home, he decided to offer her a ride. She agreed to it, but she would soon realize that she made a mistake that would change her life forever.

Judging from the ride's length, it looked as though the girl's house was only a few turns away from her school. In the middle of their ride, she realized that she shouldn't have agreed to what he said. Because at that moment, he started making some flirty and inappropriate comments towards her. This man was probably around his mid-60s and the girl was only around fourteen. Naturally, she felt disturbed. She decided to get off of the car as soon as she could, making up an excuse by saying that she was fine with him dropping her off anywhere. He didn't seem happy about it, but after a brief round of arguing, he reluctantly agreed.

Later, she found out from various individuals that the detective was normally seen around that area, spying on girls her age. That frightened her to her core, but she could do nothing but hope that he hadn't followed her home. However, one night, her hopes were proven wrong. It was meant to be an ordinary night, with her going to sleep like usual. At around dawn, though, she woke up to a terrifying sound. It sounded like two men speaking. The only two people in this house were her parents, her, and her little brother, and the voices didn't sound like her father's either. She felt chills on her spine when she recognized one of the voices. It was from the detective's. She immediately grabbed the sharpest item in her room, which just happened to be a bunch of keys. She knew that they wouldn't be of much use, but she wanted to do at least something to defend herself. The guy that the detective was with (he seemed like a fellow police officer) didn't seem like a bad person, as she heard him arguing with him about his actions. Unfortunately, she also heard the detective stabbing him to death with their kitchen knife, his screams of terror echoing around the walls. She listened intently on the footsteps, and felt absolutely horrified after realizing that the detective was coming into her room. He opened the door without any sort of hesitation. She tried to attack him before he could attack her, but since he was a trained detective and she was just a girl in high school, he easily overpowered her. For better or for worse, the rest of the police arrived before anything else could be done.

While investigating the murder of one of their officers, the police mistook the detective as an investigator instead of the culprit, so they allowed him to help out on the case. The girl desperately tried to tell them that he was the one who had attacked her, but with his position, they didn't believe her. When the police and the detective left for the day, the girl asked her mother to move out of the house for at least a month. She also decided to apply for a martial arts training, just in case something like this happened again. 

Unfortunately, this wasn't the end of the story. The girl woke up to find out that her father committed suicide. He was found hanging from a noose, leaving a suicide note saying that he couldn't live with what was happening to his daughter. However, she could tell. He hadn't killed himself; he had been murdered. There was a note from the killer, who she had discovered to be the detective, telling her that she was going to be alone forever. Easy to say, the girl was absolutely traumatized by this whole ordeal. Her little brother, however, was too young to understand the concept of death. Days later, while she was looking for her mother, the girl found her at the site where her father had 'committed suicide'. To her surprise, she was absolutely pale and looked as though she hadn't eaten or slept for days. It was at that moment that she realized that her mother was dying from a broken heart. After telling her daughter that she would love her forever, she passed away in her arms, and that was the last of that dream.

What also spooks me about this nightmare was the fact that I was seeing almost everything through the protagonist's perspective. I felt her terror, her despair, her desperation. Her house looked exactly like mine, which only made the dream even more terrifying from my eyes. I'm guessing that that's just what my brain comes to when it says 'house'. I couldn't have any more sleep after this nightmare.

Another terrifying thing, however, was the fact that these sort of stories do happen in real life. There are children out there who are being stalked by adults who should've known better, and we can't even do anything about them. Many of these cases are left unsolved, which means that the criminal simply gets away with their crimes. The real monsters already exist in our world, and most of the time, we don't know who they are.",1674433203.0

125,Dreams,"[NSFW] I had a dream about a certain sexual fantasy that I once told my ex-girlfriend I wanted to try out with her, but it wasn't my ex-gf in the dream doing it with me, it was one of my old celebrity crushes I grew up finding attractive and watching on TV doing it with me","Let me say this as a disclaimer first:  when I say ""sexual fantasy,"" I don't mean like anything extremely hard-core or obscene like what you would find in a hard-core porn video. It was more like a soft-core, erotic fantasy sexual dream,  but anyways I'm still classifying this post as NSFW anyway. 



So I had a dream that I was in a room with one of my favorite celebrity crushes, one of my old favorite TV actresses I grew up having a celebrity crush on, and we were talking about certain, intimate stuff at first, and then I said to her ""Well I've always wanted a girlfriend or a wife who was into some mild, gentle BDSM stuff cuz I've always to try out kinky, weird stuff like that when I get married."" So she asked me ""Are you dating or married to anyone right now?"" And I was like ""No I'm just single rn"" and she was like ""Well I'm not gonna actually have real sex with you, but if you want, I can try out some of your BDSM roleplay stuff with you."" And I was like ""Oh my God yes please!"" And so the dream switched and me and my favorite celebrity crush actress, we took turns spanking each other and she made me worship her feet and I really liked it 😂😂💀💀 (that's one of my sexual fantasies I used to talk about with my most recent ex-girlfriend a lot) and I said to her, ""if I date someone who likes doing stuff like this or I get married in the future and if my wife is okay with doing stuff like this, we are definitely trying this out and we're definitely doing this."" And she laughed and said ""Well I hope you find a good woman who likes it just as much as you.""  And we were laughing and joking about spanking each other 😭😭😭 I spanked her and she spanked me, and then she made me worship her feet. 




I guess my question is, is it weird that I dreamed about one of my celebrity crushes doing it with me and not my ex-girlfriend doing it? Because I thought it would make more sense for my ex-girlfriend to be doing it in the dream with me since we actually know each other personally in real life, but I don't know 🤷🏾‍♂️",1674430811.0

127,Dreams,What do my about to die dreams mean,"I don’t dream very often and usually when I do they are pretty random. Lately I’ve been dying in my dreams and it’s freaking me out because as I said I don’t dream often unless I’m taking a medication or it’s just random. I know dying signifies change or something similar. I never actually get to the dying part I just get to the extreme panic right before dying and then wake up with my heart pounding out my chest

3 instances I vividly remember.

1. Few nights ago I dreamed of watching missiles strike in the distance which then turned into an atomic bomb I guess and ofc I was in the blast radius and woke up right before being incinerated. I was sitting in the corner of a brick wall with my back towards the corner looking at the bomb explode and get bigger. 

2. This one was a bit more strange. I was kidnapped like taken hostage and stabbed in the neck I didn’t die from this but it felt like I was GOING to die eventually and from that panic I woke up. 

3. This was this morning. In the dream I was driving and I had my eyes closed ( I’m usually really distracted when I drive don’t know if that has to do with this) and next thing I know I’m falling rapidly I still didn’t open my eyes, but I knew I drove off a bridge or the side of a high overpass. Once again increasing panic as I was falling and then I awoke. 

In all these dreams they have in common that I kinda expected  the outcome. When I saw the missiles in the first dream, I knew they were missiles not an atomic bomb but that’s what it turned into as I thought it. In the second dream, I didn’t know i was going to die, I technically didn’t but that’s what I was expecting. In the third dream it was black the whole time I just knew I was driving and I knew I was next falling which I then knew would probably lead to death.

Does anyone have any insight on these?",1674429651.0
128,Dreams,Almost traumatic dream i recently had that scared me a lot,"Im freaking out over an almost traumatic nightmare i had last night

I still havent gotten over it,like i know its not real but the imagery i saw in the dream will probably scar me for life.

Basically it involved me entering youtube which at first looked pretty normal. I was scrolling through a bunch of videos and at one point I saw a strange video:its thumbnail was just an empty red screen and the title was inaudible/basically gibberish (like it literally looked like the creator smashed a keyboard or something) and then I remember in the dream I was confused so I was curious to see what was in the video.

In the beginning it showed a ferret running around near a river and another ferret that looked similar got angry and bit it and injured its leg. I remember seeing it start to bleed afterwards in the dream. I was very scared of that but I think it ended up surviving at the end of the video which I was relieved by at first,but then when I entered the comments in the dream there were bajillions of bot accounts that were saying they hoped it would bleed out and die or that 'the guy in the vid shouldn't have helped it' etc. and basically just saying a bunch of irrationally vulgar and angry stuff about the video. I clicked one of the profiles that commented that stuff and all of their videos consisted of depicting ferrets getting injured and/or sick and making very violent-sounding and graphic titles for the videos. 

I basically went down a rabbit hole in the dream and then saw someone unrelated make a video on their channel about a 'ferrethategate' controversy where ppl on youtube commented on vids of ferrets or weasels getting injured or harmed and write comments either mocking the animal or cursing about it/hating on it. I woke up during this and got scared and immediately when i woke up that morning at around 6am i immediately searched that on youtube...and you won't believe the relief I felt when I realized it didn't exist irl. Regardless,I think this nightmare is gonna scar me for life even if it isn't a realistic one.

129,Dreams,Dreamt about a friend who could potentially be in a bad way!,"I had the strangest dream last night, and for a change I actually remembered what happened. My friend/crush is often throwing events/dinners/parties. 

This dream really threw me when I woke and recalled what happened, because this time he threw a party at his own home, but he was not his usual self. I remember the people were all partying at his home, he invited them in, but then he kept disappearing and staying out of sight from everyone.

I feel uncomfortable as the negative dreams in my experience always indicate that something is wrong with them. I remember dreaming of a friend in an accident and waking to find that they were actually in hospital in the past. Although I do wonder if it’s as serious.

132,Dreams,"Dream of owl, and kid choking on birds...?","I need to understand this:
The kid was playing with others when it passes a nest of 3 birds on the ground by a bush and a tree between two homes. The birds begin trying to fly into his mouth and down his throat. All 3 try separately and come back out of his mouth each time. Then 1, 2, and finally all 3 birds are choking him at once. I can see three lumps in his throat. He suffers from the struggle of asphyxia and dies, and the birds fly back up and out of his mouth. After (what felt like) a difficult few minutes contacting and speaking with 911 where we hardly got past them understanding what the issue actually was, somehow, he revives with no help at all.

I saw an owl sitting in the nest with the birds, or just there standing there at a few points during the whole ordeal... but the owl seemed like a bystander amongst them, or when it was watching. These birds were not owls. Maybe it was watching over them when it was in the nest. That was my first thought anyway... The owl always departed the same way it arrived– unbeknownst. One moment I looked and it was there, then it wasn't...

I decided it was smart to take the child home. I had arrived in the neighborhood earlier after riding with my step mother and best friend to visit my step mom's family and the nest was directly across the street from my family's house. The boy's house was not far; about a block or so down the road. When we arrived I could see he had siblings and both parents in the home. I knocked on the glass screen door, and they let me in although they were a little confused. The boy was fine, he had walked home and began playing with his siblings once we arrived. I began telling them about what happened to their boy... I'm black. The boy is black, the mom is white and the dad is black. There were mixed kids, black kids, and white kids in the house. There was also a white maid or babysitter there. I only specify these things because I think they MIGHT bear some importance...

During my telling I could see something wasn't going over well with the parents. The owl somehow ended up being to blame, although I don't understand or know how that came to be. The owl was there in the house the whole time. It would screech at me during my account, but for some reason I wasn't alarmed. I let it fly up and perch on my arm and still it would screech out every so often. Once, I even gave it a pat on the head and smoothed it from there to its back while it screeched. That's about when I realized it was a friend to me- or did I? A better question being, why didn't I? You will understand...

As I said, they blamed the owl. I could also sense hostility towards me. I was starting to sense as though it had to do with my race, but the real, awake me would never let that be a deterrence from completing my objective. I asked what they wanted me to do, I was ready to leave this hostile environment. I feel shame for what my dream self did next.

As I turned to leave, they said they would deal with the bird. They had almost gotten friendly. I started towards the porch, out the door, and down the stairs to the driveway. I looked back. I can still hear my subconscious arguing back at my dream self to get the damned owl. I said, ""Are you sure? I can just take the bird. There was no problem with it.""
""Don't worry about it, just leave,"" they replied. ""We'll take care of it.""

And I left, both my real self and my dream self feeling duncely as I rounded out the driveway and back the way I came.

The dream ended about here... I would appreciate insights on interpretation. I've done a little research and also tested against what I know about my own psyche to backup my interpretation, but I would love if anyone cares to share more about the symbolism my brain has thoughtfully provided....",1674426962.0

139,Dreams,Dream that a giant llama killed me,"I was on a double decker bus and as we drove past these green hills, there were llamas as big as trees just hanging out, enjoying the sunlight. Some were half shaved for their fur, kind of like sheep. 

I was like, “WHOA those alpacas are HUGE.” 

“Um they’re llamas not alpacas. Clearly they’re eating mushrooms, so they’re llamas.” 

Sure enough there were MASSIVE mushrooms near the llamas. 

(No idea where that stupid logic came from)

One llama walked over by the road, and even though the bus was going 40 mph, the llama was keeping up fine. I could see the small head of the llama next to the window of this double decker bus—the llama was two stories tall. And I start to feel uneasy and wonder “is this llama about to attack the bus…?” 

The llama passes the bus and is running in front of the bus, and suddenly I can see from a bird’s eye view of the bus that we’re on this land bridge, and the bridge has narrowed to just the road—and the ground crumbles beneath the llama’s feet as it passes.

Our bus driver guns it, and we make it over the giant hole in the ground.

But it’s like in a movie where the ground is continuing to crumble with every step the llama takes, and I can feel the bus falling, and I think, “Noooo my husband will be so sad without me, I can’t die, please for my husband’s sake I have to survive—“

And then I realize I’m STILL FALLING and I think, “Yeah there’s no way I’m surviving this.”

145,Dreams,Robot dueling dream,"I am in the middle of an endless field with metal and sand everywhere. There is an extremely fast and strong humanoid robot trying to game-end me and I had a random weapon assigned to me to help me game-end it, which is a blue lightsaber in this case.

https://preview.redd.it/x8awkm8o7nda1.jpg?width=1368&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=45795834e52a16c3b1a2efba1653e0a3f0978d75

The robot lunged at me with a kick and I was able to dodge it. The robot seemed to have a period of time where it couldn't do anything after lunging for a brief period of time. I was able to slash right through the robot with the lightsaber multiple times, but the robot didn't fall apart or break despite the blade cutting right through the body of the robot. After my failed attempts, the robot regains mobility and punches me, knocking me out.

Instantly after getting punched, I am in the same area described earlier, the endless metal sand field, facing off against a faster version of the humanoid robot from before, but with a different weapon.

If I had to try and describe this weapon, it was an extremely lightweight, blue and white sword (I'll put a picture from google images that look similar to the sword).

https://preview.redd.it/jw5q4vwh7nda1.jpg?width=1400&amp;format=pjpg&amp;auto=webp&amp;v=enabled&amp;s=d56023ada23d4e3cb09492423ababb6f658678f1

The robot gets the first attack again like the previous duel, but instead of lunging at me, it breaks up its entire body into three large, floating, sharp blades that launched at me. The first two were easy to dodge, but the last one transformed right before it flew at me into the head of the robot, and it went even faster than the first two blades along with having an added homing-missle-like ability. 

Right before it came in contact with me, I hit it with the sword I described earlier and launched the head backward, causing the rest of the robot's body to appear to catch the head from falling on the ground.

I used this period of vulnerability to get even more hits on the robot compared to the amounts I got in my previous duel with the lightsaber because the blue-and-white sword was lighter.

I predicted that the robot was going to snap out of its confused state, and dodged the kick that it delivered after I finished my slicing, causing me to back off and keep a distance once again.

Staring down at the robot, I see that I did no physical damage to the robot compared to when the fight started. I got extremely angry at this fact and threw the sword as hard as I could at the robot. The sword went extremely fast, so the robot couldn't react in time, and the sword went right through its head.

I thought I had broken the robot because the bright lights on its eyes turned dark, luring me into a false sense of security.

But after this seemingly successful attack, the lights on the robot's head turned back on, it took out the sword sticking out of its head, causing some bright sparks to come out of the hole in its head, and it pursued me at almost lightspeed with the sword in its hand.

The robot was about to hit me with the sword, and I flinched, causing me to jolt awake in an upright position.

I do not know why this dream was so much darker than my previous dream, but if I had to guess what the meaning is (if it even exists), it would be because of unknown subconscious thoughts about whether my actions in the real world are futile.

155,Dreams,I had a very vivid dream where I murdered someone. Should I be worried?,"Last night I had this dream, I can't remember all the details but I'll try to describe it as best I can. In the dream, I was in this big house (it wasn't my house but I don't remember whose it was or why I was there exactly). The people whose house it was knew I was there and had invited me to stay the night. It was around the time when everyone was getting ready to go to bed. I think I had a bedroom to myself, my dad might have been there with me but I don't remember. Anyway, I had locked myself in the bathroom attached to my bedroom with one of the family members (a man), and I don't remember how I did it but I had killed him. It definitely wasn't an accident, I had planned and executed the murder. I knew I had to do something with the body and I decided that I would hang him to make it look like a suicide. I searched the cabinets in the bathroom and found a power cable that was long enough.

Every now and then someone would knock on the bathroom door, but I was able to get them to go away. I debated opening it and slashing their throat with a razor I had found in one of the drawers, but I thought the blood would make too much of a mess and be difficult to clean up. I tied the cable around his neck, tossed it over the shower curtain rod, and hoisted up the body, then tied the cable. I realised that, since people had been knocking on the door, I would look incredibly suspicious when they found the body in the morning. I resolved that I would hide the body until the middle of the night, then carry it to a different bathroom and hang him there. But at this point, someone needed to get into the bathroom again.The only place I could hide the body was in the shower behind the curtains, but I worried that the person would need to take a shower. I started panicking, and that's when I woke up.

Now, I normally wouldn't be too concerned about a dream like this, but this isn't the first time I've had thoughts or desires of murder. This is, however, the first time I've dreamt of it in such detail. I have struggled before with obsessing about murder and thinking about how I would murder someone in my life. Obviously I never went through with any of those thoughts, but they felt very compelling at times. The fact that this dream was so detailed, so real, and that I had no problem coming up with an intricate plan to get away with murder worries me. Does this dream actually mean anything or am I overreacting?",1674410118.0

157,Dreams,"A “doctor”, and Stormy Weather","I’m leaving a building I’ve seen before (probably me remembering a building I’ve seen from my childhood— but I don’t remember where exactly it was… and it was likely a mix of all my favorite places I’ve been to before.)— And on my way out, I see a child sitting in the corner on my way out the door.

I don’t remember what we were talking about, but we talked a little bit. She was sick, and she looked just like me when I was five years old (That part is coming from me looking through my old yearbooks yesterday). I’ve dealt with chronic pain and illness since I was very little, so I knew what was happening.

I took of my backpack, and I gave her medicine. As I leave, she doesn’t let me go. She’s hugging my legs, making it impossible for me to walk out.

I agree to take her home, whatever that may be— but she’d have to be on my back instead (piggy back riding); she looked up at me and smiled.

As we both go outside, it’s raining— but in an unusual way. You hear the rain and see it on the ground, and you also see all the lights from the streetlights reflecting in it. Everything sounds and looks the same, except the rain water was completely missing us, despite me not using an umbrella. Arms reach away from us, the rain is coming down like normal— but where we stood, not a drop was touching us. This is the part that made me want to type this out, because I could see and feel everything, and it looked so beautiful. It looked like I was in another combination of all my favorite places— except it was filled with lights and raining.

I keep walking towards her home, but she’s not speaking to me. At that point, I assume she’s asleep.

1/4th of the way there, she wakes up and asked to be let down— so I take her off my back. We continue the rest of the way walking side by side and holding hands— rain easing up, but still not touching us.

The closer we get, the more everything around us changes. The sky starts to clear and it’s sunny outside, but I’m in a new place completely. We were both at a childhood place that’s meaningful to me. We keep walking forward, because we aren’t home yet.

She looked up at me and smiled again. I remember smiling back.

At some point while we were walking, we ended up underwater, but we could still breathe. The water was unusually bright (cartoony ocean water look), and there was litter scattered across the ocean floor. I see my first car in the distance, and I’m confused.

We keep walking, and we are finally where she calls home. This time, the environment changed again— and we were still underwater, but everything was bright, colorful, and clean. Overhead, I see the surface of the water and see pink and orange flowers. 

I brought the girl home, but there were no adults nearby. I think maybe, she lived alone. Maybe she just missed seeing someone, but was otherwise alright living on her own.

Or maybe this was just a dream of me reconnecting to my youth, and being symbolic of how I care for myself now. 

She was a younger me, in every way. Right down to looks, right down to the pain we felt. She called me a “doctor” because I helped her feel better. In real life, nobody took my pain seriously and I didn’t know what helped with my pain until I was 19 years old and went through tons of doctors and testing. When I was little in real life, my severe pain was just “tantrums” And me “trying to get attention.” I would be in pain for days and nobody cared.

The other day I dreamt that I was a falsely accused serial killer in the hiding, but while hiding, I hurt a lot of people who posed a risk to me.

when i woke up at 6:45 my cat was meowing and i knew i needed to feed him but i ran out of cat food so i texted my roommate to ask for some of theirs. i laid down to go back to sleep until they responded and i could feed my cat. my dream starts with me going to my roommates room to grab their cat food, but it looked different than it normally does so i was confused. at first i thought it was real life, but then i realized i was asleep. then suddenly i heard like a grilling sound and i was pulled somewhere else and i was watching these people grill their food. i walked up to one of the bowls of food and i was inspecting it really closely and i said to myself wow that looks so good and the person whose food it was replied back and started talking to me. i was surprised that she could see me and started wondering about what was happening so i talked to her for a really long time

i asked her a bunch of questions but it’s fading from me rn. we talked about her food and how she cooked it. then she brought me to her house where her twin sister and her boyfriend were. we sat in a room and talked for so long. i think i asked her or i wondered to myself about what i was. her twin sister could also see me but she was nonverbal so we didn’t talk. i asked her if it was ok to know what year it was and she told me it was 2019. i had a little excited freak out and told her it was 2023 for me. then i pulled out my phone and went on my instagram and it was like my instagram in 2019 but slightly different, like another me 

we continued talking and then her other family members started showing up and i felt like i had to leave so i was asking her like how do i do it basically. she took me to a closet in the room we were in and showed me her and her boyfriends sleeping bodies. i was very surprised to see their sleeping bodies. and i looked at her boyfriend and i was like you’ve been able to see me the whole time? why didn’t you say anything? and he was like you guys looked like you were having fun. then i just like instantly woke up

In this dream, some strange gas cloud was approaching the Earth from outer space... It was of unknown origin, so scientists feared that it was poisonous and threatened mankind. It was recommended that they begin to build shelters for themselves underground.

The day came when the cloud descended on Earth and... nothing happened... everyone was happy and went back to business.

However, the next morning it was discovered that this gas cloud had somehow affected the DNA of the insects. All insects mutated differently (some grew to several meters in length, some became faster, some became invisible)... BUT! all of them became more intelligent. They didn't get smarter than humans, no... but they got smart enough to realize they were stronger. The real insect-calypse has begun.

But, at least, underground shelters were ALREADY built - not bad at all. Mankind hid there and began to think what to do.

But while they were thinking, another surprise came from outer space - a meteor shower began. All the insects were wiped out. Isn't that a miracle?!

This is one of my childhood nightmares (as you can guess, it has something to do with huge octopuses :D)

In my dream there was a disease that infected all the cattle, and the usual meat became unfit to eat...

Most people would (probably) think, ""It must be a sign from above to become vegetarians..."" But not everyone was in agreement with that.

After few months, some scientists came up with innovative idea! They brought out a new kind of octopuses (like a domestic animal for slaughter). The octopuses was immune to this unknown disease. And can be fed with household waste (how convenient is that!). They can gain weight easily and quickly reach enormous sizes. On top of that they could easily grow a limb back (regenerate), which made them an endless source of meat!

However, all “good” things should come to an end. And (of course) some time later there was an octopus uprising. And then, a typical dystopia without a happy ending",1674404262.0

building their homes in trees, using helicopters instead of using cars… etc

Cause it blowed my mind

1. I had to prepare a birthday gift to someone
2. I thought about it quite a lot (made list with the best of my ideas)
3. then I became the other person (you know like different pov. I was still It the same room, but different person)
4. and I was able to see my previous self, and she started to bake apple puffs for some reason
5. and then she went to other room, after some time came out of the room with a gift pack
6. and then she said we are ready to go (to congratulate a friend)
7. and next moment I see how she hans out a gift, and she looked on it dumbfoundedly
8. and a gifty was like “oooo-kay, thanks”, but her brother was like “are you kidding me?! If you won’t use it, give it to me!”
9. and then he took a pocket and went to another room.
10. after 3 minutes he walked out of the room…

With only shorts on…

Shorts sewn from apple puffs!

And he started admiringly talking about how it's the coolest thing in the world

11) and a new me was like “wtf?😳”, and a giftey was „WTF x2“, and ... previous me was involved a delightful conversation

12) apparently! It was the legendary long-forgotten sewing technique for… waterproof clothes!

171,Dreams,Had quite possibly the strangest dream i've had in a while,"It began with me walking through a wide, tall, underground hallway entirely painted white or light gray, kinda like some large hospital. I was accompanied by about 10 people, dressed in civillian clothes but otherwise unremarkable. We were going to some kind of containment chamber or something, in which there was this giant serpent thing. One of us fed it something (I don't remember what it was), then the alarms went off and we started running to the parking lot. Above the containment facility was some large, monolithic building with red banners hanging from it (they had some golden/yellow symbol but I can't recall it). One of us pulled out some ancient papyrus with a map of sorts detailing exactly where to stand relative to the serpent, which we did.

There was a flash of light, and we were suddenly on a raft in what I can only describe as some form of limbo. The raft was decently large, floating on a seemingly infinite ocean. It was presumably dusk, and everything was lit dark purple. It felt like some form of apocalypse had happened, since the raft had a lot of seemingly salvaged stuff like powerbanks, canned food, etc. There were over 20 people on the raft, a lot more than the group I was in during the start of the dream, so I assumed the serpent had done this before, whatever it was. Phones, and presumably radio, worked in this limbo.

There was a part involving some bright flashes of light or something, but I can't remember the details.

After that, we made contact with another raft. We had arranged to meet up, trade supplies and exchange some crew members to maintain a stable gene pool, since for all we knew we were stuck there for good. The dream ended after that.",1674402497.0

It's pretty much a sleep paralysis but with real physical pain, and complete awareness of what's happening to me.  
I would describe this as if something didn't want me to find out i was dreaming and needs to incapacite me somehow.

Things that happend beyond these point vary, one instance i heard a lot of noise in my room including my guitars playing by themselves and doors closing and opening, one other time as i was under this condition i heard someone talking really close to my ear about wanting to kill me.

No, i am not a schizo, or have any kind of seizures or any medical condition.  


I am unable to lucid dream because of this, i have been having these episodes for about 6 years, about 4 times a month, i was really scared the first times but now i just deal with the pain and try to stay calm, but even then when i stop being paralized i am completly terrified about what could be in my room.

195,Dreams,Two weird dreams I had when I was little,"The first one was the oldest and it was when I was like 4 or 5 and the dream was that me and my dad were in his car driving at night in a desert similar to the middle of nowhere in courage the cowardly dog. We drive for a few minutes but stop at a gas station and go in. I asked him if I can get snacks and he said yes so I went to the snack isle. While I was looking up at all of the chips and candy, the lights flickered and my dad came to me and hugged me as if he was sheltering me from something before he took my hand and led me to a different isle farther from the door in the now much longer gas station. The lights went out and I heard boots on the floor before he found us and spoke with my dad. He was nice at first but then he reached under his skin and peeled his face off revealing what looked like John Marston’s face on the cover of red dead redemption undead nightmare. After I looked at him for a second or two he said “you were late to the show” before I woke up.
Second dream was when I was like 6 and it was my whole family driving at sunset in a grassy woodland area with overly smooth and large hills. I asked where we were going but I don’t remember what they said. It became night soon after. We finally got to the place we were going but it was just a house similar to the one square and triangle drawings we did as kids. It was a very small two story house. They step outside the car so I and my sister do as well. My parents said to go in but my sister stayed outside. Upon entry I immediately noted that the house had school style fluorescent light that weren’t on and the house was just a short hallway leading to some stairs. I walked up to the stairs leading to an extremely small room that connects directly to the stairs without any hallways or doorways and a light pink floral design you’d see in a grandmas house. In the room there was nothing but a red wooden chair in the center. I immediately felt a ton of fear but don’t know why.",1674382194.0
196,Dreams,"Weird cars, Strange war footage, Movie in a garage, a school"," Saturday, January 21 2023 

There was a lot to this dream, more than usual. Considering my dream recall has been null for a few months I really need to write this down.

The dream started with me and my dad at this small restaurant. I remember getting something that was cheesy, with lots of cheddar inside it. It was some kind of breakfast quesadilla, it had scrambled eggs and bacon in it. I was sitting with my dad when I'm looking at this TV talking about what's going on in Europe. It was reading it off like a list. Showing words and maps, no sound at all was coming from the TV and its program. I remember talking to my dad about something but I can't recall what I said. 

Dream shifts and I'm in a car with someone I don't know. There were other cars as well. They didn't look normal whatsoever. The cars had their engines in the front or back. Their bodies were separated into three sections that pointed outward on both driver and passenger sides. I might draw this down later today if given the chance to. One of the weird six-sided cars has the sides made out of a mossy-covered stone for some odd reason. Most of the cars in the dream had open tops. I could feel the wind as we drove down the road. The road we were driving on was in a forest. I remember us riding up alongside who I presume were this person's friends or they knew them. I remember seeing some other cars pass us by going the opposite direction, some guy was on a scooter and for some reason, he looked like Hitler which I find is the oddest part about this dream. After seeing the weird Hitler-like guy racing another car on a scooter pass by I look in front of me and I see a Nascar Stock car about to book it straight down the road. ""What is an American Stock car doing here?"", I asked. Whenever I looked at it I remember my eyes acting like a camera and zooming in on it from a distance away. The Stock car takes off down the road at incredible speeds and then proceeds to go off the road behind us and flying off a hill never to be seen again.   


Dream shifts and I'm looking at some alternate old war footage. The planes I was looking at were German. They were huge and had this weird holes in the center of them. The planes took off nearly vertically with no runway at all. 

Dream shifts and I'm back in the car. It was as if I never left the car. It is now night. I can see the lights of other vehicles passing by. We are driving and a building catches my attention. It's a school. I remember looking into its huge window it had facing the road and seeing tables, and chairs. The floor was a weird lighter dark green. The school's lights were off and was very much closed.   


Dream shifts and we're at this weird older gas station and garage. The mechanic's garage had its garage doors open. People were sitting inside, and watching a movie. I had to use the bathroom so I make a B line straight to it. As I'm walking to the bathroom I walk into the counter. I apologize to the guy sitting behind it and move on. I continue walking to the bathroom and I see a balder black-haired guy like he just got his head shaven and a blonde woman. I remember looking at the blonde woman who was smiling. I kinda stared into her eyes for a bit. Her eyes were kinda green or blue. 

Dream shifts and I'm at the school I saw earlier. I was wearing glasses at this part of the dream. I don't even have a need to wear glasses in the waking world. There are people at separate tables talking to each other. I walk up to this table with three people sitting at it, a chair was open so I decide to sit down. The black-haired woman with her hair in a bun is who I remember most at the table. She was also wearing glasses. She shows me a few different drawings and says, ""Are you from where any of these are?"". I look at the images she's showing me. They were colorful but also childish in nature. I say ""No"" and I get a piece of paper and start drawing something. I have no clue why but I suddenly wanted to draw a river. Also a word kept playing itself over and over again in my head. The word was Spanish. It was ""llarona"" for some reason.   
 

Dream shifts and I'm back the restaurant with my dad. I look inside and I see the quesadilla from earlier in the dream. ""Its still there. Look."", I say. ""That's weird, It shouldn't be there."", My dad replies back. This should've been a lucid trigger but it wasn't. 

Dream shifts, but this time is the final time the dream shifts. I am looking at a map. It is showing a large horizontal continent. It was like I was in space looking down at this world. Stuff was labeled in pink, and yellow. The map was labeled what it called ""Dimensional Boundaries"". If you crossed this border where it was labeled you would cross dimensions. After looking at the map for a bit the dream finally ends. ",1674377910.0

The sound of the waves timed rhythmically, sounding like thick viscous bubbles fighting to escape to the surface. It doesn’t sound as it should so my focus fixes onto the water. 
 
It is purple and sludge like. The sun turns cold and the air tinted blue. The sea beacons me to touch it. I dip my foot in and bubbles fizz around my skin. I’m dissolving. I can’t escape as I feel the sea creeping its way up my leg, sizzling as it did so. The last thing it eats is my awareness.

199,Dreams,what the f just happened,"Okay, so I just woke up and I had possibly the weirdest dream of my life, and I need to document it.

The dream starts at my secondary school, where the entire school (staff and students) have been taken hostage by some sort of shadowy skeleton army (ssa) in the canteen. A couple of us have not yet been captured, and are in a constant battle with the ssa to 1. stay alive and uncaptured and 2. free the school.

This fight goes on for roughly 15 minutes, as wave after wave of the ssa is fought off by my friends and I throughout the school. I lose quite a lot of my close friends in this dream, but that's not the worst part.

At some point, we are outnumbered at the (locked) entrance of the school, and we can do nothing but surrender. We are dragged back to the canteen \*cue dramatic entrance with sympathetically looking friends\*, and there it is announced that the Headmaster and the ssa have come to an agreement: The school has to close forever and everyone needs to leave immediately.

As we're made to walk out of the canteen, I hug/walk/cry with one of my previous crushes, about when we met and friendship and the Hollywood-esque bs that comes with it.

&amp;#x200B;

\*cue first location change\*We are now on the second-highest floor of my primary school, still in the process of leaving and the emotional bs. I ask my music teacher if I can go the highest floor to say goodbye to the memories(?), and she gives me permission. I walk up the stairs (which are also ladders, naturally). I walk through a sort of hotel-like corridor, where I see a boy that looks like Walker Scobell.

\*cue second location change\*Together, we walk along, as we come to a dual concert, with a double-sided stage.On one side, (Roald Dahl's) Matilda's mum, who is mixed with Dolly Parton, is singing (idk what).On the other side is Madonna.

I walk onto Matilly Mumton's side of the stage, where I dramatically collapse.

\- The end -

Notes:I have a rough idea of where all the elements of this dream came from, but I'm still slightly confused about why I can remember so much of it so clearly, and why it was so long.

201,Dreams,Geometric Shapes in Nightmares,"Okay, I need to know if anyone else has experienced this.

I used to have these reoccurring nightmares as a child, starting from approximately age 6 and all the way up until 25. I'm currently 35 now and thankfully haven't had one in about a decade and pray to never have another.

These nightmares were so intense that I still remember exactly how they looked and the absolute terror that came with them. It always started with me being in a vast, open space that was either completely white or very dark blue/black. Next would come a geometric shape into my field of vision, most often spheres or pyramid shapes. This shape was of an impossibility huge size, it was so large that my mind would begin to panic trying to comprehend the size. Imagine being an ant and trying to understand something the size of an entire planet - that was the feeling of seeing this geometric object.

The gigantic size was never the worst part though. The worst part was how very slowly it moved. I realize this sounds ridiculous, but this geometric shape would start moving across my vision in the most agonizingly slow motion, and it caused the most severe feelings of panic and unnameable dread. It felt like the slowness was grinding at my actual soul, as though witnessing this enormous thing moving so very slowly was going to not only kill me, but actually un-make me. The fear of watching this thing was something that I'll never be able to put into words. It was the worst feeling I have ever experienced. I would wake up in a severe panic attack every single time I would have these nightmares, hysterically crying and shaking, my heart pounding out of my chest.

These geometric shapes always felt somewhat sentient, as though they knew I was watching them and they knew what terror they were causing me to experience. It was not an entirely evil feeling, but more like they were a detached observer, as though I were completely inconsequential and meaningless in the face of their vastness and power. They never spoke or communicated in any way, it was just the feeling I got every time.

Other things that were always in these nightmares -

The geometric shapes were always faintly metallic or glowing. Either gold, red, neon pink, or shades of blue.

There was always a sense of sound during the nightmare, but nothing I know how to perfectly describe. Imagine the sound of something grinding all around you, like a very low constant rumble that becomes a sort of white noise.

There was a sensation of pressure, or compression, while watching these geometric shapes. It felt like the air was very heavy and it was trying to press me into an even smaller shape.

I realize this all sounds kind of ridiculous, but I'm serious when I tell you these nightmares caused me such severe fear that I would beg my mom not to make me go to sleep as a child. I have never experienced anything like the soul crushing terror of these things, and I have no idea why these huge geometric shapes and their impossible slowness were so horrifying. 

Is there anyone out there who has experienced anything even similar to this in a dream? I would love to know I'm not alone in this.",1674373452.0

204,Dreams,an official 1 month of experiencing the same dream non-stop,"ive been flying in my dreams for over a month now, it’s non-stop. it’s weird because everytime i have a dream and/or a nightmare, i ALWAYS have the ability to fly in each and every one of them. if it was a dream, i would fly across the big ocean and explore different places, it’s pretty relaxing and it made me happy. but unfortunately, relaxing and nice dreams about me flying would rarely happen. i mostly have nightmares about it. if it’s a nightmare, then i would always be escaping/flying away from some sort of threat—it’s like a predator hunting it’s prey except i am the prey trying to get away. fortunately though, i’ve been able to successfully escape my threat countless of times. there hasn’t been one single time where i’ve been successfully hunted by a prey (yet…), and the weird thing is, the predator ive been escaping from is always the same. i don’t know what it looks like and i don’t know what it wants from me. of course, i don’t wanna know so i keep trying my best to escape. basically, my nightmares mostly involves an intense goosechase from this same unknown entity. but instead of being scared, i felt thrilled and excited about it. i know it’s weird to have these feelings when having a nightmare but the fact that i could just fly away instead of run away from the threat just makes it exciting if that make sense. the interesting part, i never had a feeling like i was a human who could fly when i had these dreams/nightmares. i felt like a small bird, i don’t know which bird, but just a small bird. of course, i would sometimes dream about being a big bird soaring through the sky too, but that rarely happens so im not going in depth about that. whether it’d be nightmares or dreams i was having, i felt free and happy that i could just fly around. i felt like i wanted to stay in my dreams/nightmares a little longer to just be able to fly and be free, i was basically happier in the dream world as a bird. this time though, i wasn’t a bird. i was still able to fly, but now im a human with big white wings. this change didn’t really bother me, i still felt thrilled, happy and excited because no matter what form i had to take, atleast i could fly. this was a nightmare though and i won’t get in depth with it, but you can still ask me about it though! but TW, it involves unaliving yourself. sorry if this was a long post, i just wanted to get this off my chest because i haven’t told anyone about this, so what do you think? have you had the same experience? i would love to hear ^^. thank you for reading my long post lol",1674371343.0

208,Dreams,Extremely strange SM64DS-related dream I had,"I was not the one playing, but I was viewing what appeared to be an SM64DS boss fight. I could tell that's what it was because I remember seeing a minimap of the arena where the fight was taking place, which looked like the SM64DS minimap layout. The player I was spectating was playing as Mario, and the boss, while I do not remember as well, was a really large Skeeter from Wet Dry World. The arena was in a large, almost box-like area, that was filled halfway with water. Mario was on a platform that he could control the directions of while the Skeeter could travel quickly over the water. 

Now, here are the really interesting parts.

The water physics were not even close to the original game at all. Instead of swimming in the water, Mario would fall right through it as if it did not exist. This made a situation where if Mario fell off the only platform floating on the water during the fight, he would hit the bottom and die from fall damage.

I remember, for no good reason at all, believing that the player was doing a challenge during the boss where he had the Skeeter attack in every part of the arena where the fight took place in. This made the fight harder because the attacks would cause Mario to be unable to go back to where the Skeeter just attacked. This is due to a mechanic the Skeeter had where it created a whirlpool every time it attacked. 

The player did not die during the dream. Instead, after creating whirlpools in every part of the arena except for a small corner, the player cornered the Skeeter against the wall and bashed it with the platform Mario was on until the Skeeter exploded in a cutscene.

After the Skeeter exploded, the platform Mario was riding on disappeared, and the water level got lowered to the very bottom of the arena where Mario could run along the bottom. At the bottom of the stage in one of the corners, there was a star in a cage and the player grabbed the star after entering the cage. Strangely, the player not only didn't get a key after beating the Skeeter (which is what normally happens in SM64DS after beating a boss), but there was also another yellow star outside of the cage right next to the cage containing the star that the player grabbed.

After Mario jumped toward the star, my dream ended.

\---

The main reason why this dream stuck out to me was because of the fact that I had not played SM64DS in 15 years. I do not know what caused me to dream about it, but it was so jarring that I did because of how obscure it is as a game. I also felt inspired to do some more research on the game to cross-reference what happened in the boss fight for my dream to the actual boss fights in the game (serious dream analysis aside, a Skeeter boss fight in Wet Dry World sounds like a scrapped idea during the development of SM64DS).",1674366831.0
209,Dreams,What does this mean?,"I use to be able to mention I was dreaming to ppl in my dream I knew I was dreaming and the most hostile reaction I would get was “no you actually teleported and time traveled here” and that turned into an argument.

Hinted at a dream person I knew and they screeched and charged at me before I didn’t let that slide, this repeated. 2 nights ago I had a dream about some white creature spewing gore all over, I had 2 false awaking after and in both I tried hard to forgot what I saw.

212,Dreams,Strangest lucid nightmere I ever had and a very rude awakening,"I had this weird lucid nightmere. O.o 

I was cycling down a path. Suddenly my friend and her brother were cycling with me. My e-bike ended up losing a gear. I ended up losing the friend and cycled onward. It was a narrow path. 

Suddenly I saw a lot of people on foot. Kids, adults, strollers. I decided to go past them, bumped my head a few times against some tree's, and slowely wormed my way through the crowd on my e-bike. I stopped at a dead end where a hole in the road was pressent. I saw people going down it. So I pulled my e-bike into the hole with me. 

There was a narrow corridor. I pulled my e-bike through  it behind me (it was on its side). Eventually I saw light. I tried pulling on my e-bike again, but it wouldnt budge. I looked behind me and saw a kid. I asked the kid to let go of my e-bike which they did. I went out of the corridor into the light and pulled out my e-bike. It was now missing the entire back wheel. The kid came out and I asked him about the wheel. He claimed he did not know where it went.

He looked at my e-bike and noticed my peddle. ""cool! The stick!"" he yelled out. (For some reason I knew in my head that in this world ""the stick"" was a famous racebiker or something). Yes I replied. The kid then told me he would help me look for the parts. (I wanted to find them to get it fixed). He ran back into the corridor and I followed suit. 

To my surprise it was now a big, well lit, office on the inside. There were people behind desks. The kid yelled at one guy to ""open the safe"" which the guy refused. The other guy in the back, seemed like he was incharge. 

I walked towards him and we talked. I can not remember what we talked about, but I got an evil fibe from him. I then grabbed a pen and stabbed him in the throat with it. He just laughed and didn't choke. I did it twice more with no different resulds. The 3th time he pretended to be choking. 

By now I was lucid and so I got curious. I grabbed a pair of scissors from the desk and stabbed him with that. He did seem to get hurt but didn't die. Then I proceeded to punch one of his eyes and it turned black and bloodshot. Punched the other and the same happened. At this point he started looking demonic and I became affraid. 

He looked into my eyes. And I heard him say: I see .... (and I could not hear the rest) and ended up in some sort of hypnosis. 

I could feel myself waking up. But before I fully awoke everything was white, my eyes were closed and I saw the outline of a village or farm or something, slowely moving into the distance. The last outline I saw where a church and a Dutch windmill.

But she hadn’t disappeared at all. She was still standing at the reception desk. On the desk was a note that the man had dropped, and on the note was what looked like a name.

217,Dreams,Picker-wheel school shooting,"I know the title is weird but let me explain… I’ve been told it’s actually somewhat of a funny sounding dream by some friends. 

So me and a bunch of kids from my high school were selected for a field trip where we got to experience a tour of a university campus, which seemed very difficult to navigate. A student caught up with the rest of the group, exclaiming that he found a dead body. The automatic assumption was that there was a shooter in the building, and everyone started freaking out. 

This is where things just get stupid. An announcement was made on the intercom, instructing everyone (yes everyone, including the mystery shooter) to make their way to the gymnasium. After the teachers gathered everyone into the gymnasium and locked the doors, everyone was sat on the bleachers, and one of the staff members brought out one of those giant colorful picker wheels like one you’d find on “Spin The Wheel”. Suddenly, a game of random trivia commenced. At this point I was in disbelief and I started freaking out, because the shooter was in the gymnasium with us. At random, students were chosen to step up and answer a trivia question and spin the wheel. At some point, I was called on. I don’t remember if I answered correctly or what the question was, but immediately after, some girl with a gun walked up to me, and in a very slow and dramatic fashion, aimed the gun at my feet. This was the point when I woke up and just asked myself what the hell I had just dreamt.

I looked into his eyes and the darkness under it's hood turned from yellow eyes to a treasure trove with stuff in it and I took a purple ring. I turned around where a dog shaman gave me a wooden bowl with magic water that heals people. Next thing I know I'm speaking Italian with my best friend's brother who just told me we are going to see him? Next comes the evil plow truck, my best friend doesn't even bat an eye and just says ""this is just how it is"", sits down, relaxes and then gets hit by it. Me and his brother run to find him, he's bleeding from the mouth on the snow. I run and find the dog shaman who doesn't give me a wooden bowl but a wooooden bowl this time. I run up to his mom and tell her ""where is he?"" And find him shivering in a million blankets. So I heal him but he had his legs removed and he goes from blue and bruised to healthy, I then heal his detached legs that he never puts back on. A mumble version of beyoncé starts playing and I wake up. (To be fair I never really listen to her lyrics she's just always playing in the background of things and movies in really life.)",1674357790.0
219,Dreams,Is it possible to dream about something you’ve never heard of?,"I had a dream a while ago that I had anthrax and was joking around my friends about coughing on them and giving them it. The thing is, I’ve never heard of anthrax in my life before and have no idea how I dreamed about it. I am 100% sure that during that point in my life I had never heard of anthrax before nor did I know what it was. I looked it up when I woke up and kinda just forgot about it until today where I was watching a YouTube video about the 2001 anthrax attacks. Is it possible to dream about things that you never heard about, I’m just really confused by this.",1674357568.0
220,Dreams,I had this wild dream that I was in a podcast and I was the only one in it.,So I slept pretty nice today but I had this dream where I was in the podcast and I was the only one talking when it rendered. Like there was another dude but the audio didn't save them and it was just me with audio. We were in this booth and there was a gorilla in the corner. It was called The Sex Pod. We only uploaded it on YouTube for some reason. I genuinely forgot what we talked about so I just rambled on. I recreated it here.

221,Dreams,So I had this one dream a while ago that still hasn’t left my head…,"So when I was younger, idk how old maybe 10-11, I had this dream where I was walking to a big building and I decided to go in. I started walking up the staircase and it felt kind of endless but for some reason I wasn’t tired, the stairs had this weird pattern like the rugs you see at hotels yk the ones in the hallways, the walls were like a dark mustard yellow and the doors were brown and they had gold doorknobs. I walked towards a door and slightly opened it and suddenly I heard the loudest scream I had ever heard. It sounded like a woman but a little muffled and I immediately slammed the door and ran as fast as I possibly could, I heard the woman’s (or thing’s ) screams get louder and louder like they were running towards me. I started getting tired and kept tripping when I was running up the stairs until I ran into a random room I saw and slammed the door, then the screaming stopped. My heart was racing and I felt so scared at the time, then suddenly I woke up. I don’t know why I still remember this dream but I do and it really scared the shit out of me when that happened, it felt so real to me and I genuinely thought that this person was actually running after me. I was so happy that I woke up when I did.",1674355969.0
222,Dreams,I dreamt I was the hair stylist of Beyoncé,"The other night I dreamt I was beyonces hair stylist, which is not surprising to me as 
A) my dreams are crazy, this was particularly tame 
B) i just so happen to be a hair stylist 

But... a few weird things happened surrounding this dream in my real life 

For those who want a down low on My dream (not the main point of this post) 

I saw beyonce perform in a car park by accident as she was doing a random pop up concert, behind a wire fence (the kind you see on council estates... true beyonce style..?)all my friends were there... even some people who I have never spoken to from my gym.... in gym wear

My boyfriend even came to see her at this random car park, he turned up topless and on a razor kick scooter...? (Dont ask questions, its just not worth it).

I ended up talking to her and she asked me to be her stylists, we became best friends and I was blowdrying her curly hair, it was blowdrying like a stylists wet fucking dream, smooth glossy, her curls were just smoothing out like butter.

I even woke up from my dream to my alarm, snoozed my alarm.... and went back into my dream ... just to finish beyonces hair

Anyway, my point is 

Before I went to bed my boyfriend put my phone on aeroplane mode, he NEVER does this, I think he was just sick of hearing my phone ping all night, when I woke up my Spotify was on my home screen, and it had a beyonce song on ready to hit play.... a beyonce song  i have never heard of... I'm not a huge beyonce fan, I don't listen to beyonces songs, I have not been googling beyonce ..... i have not been watching television that day there was no beyonce related content to my day 

So how when my phone was on aeroplane mode ... in my sleep .... did it suggest that the last song I might have been listening to was a beyonce song ... I'm creeped. Somebody make it make sense.",1674355444.0

224,Dreams,I have very vivid dreams and can remember a few of them even though they have happened years ago. This was last nights.,"Was working out with friends at gym. Then I started to order food but a can of soda was 5 bucks but a bag of ruffles was cheaper. For some reason you had to call for the chips (ruffles) (maybe they only had sodas there) and the lady told me to go towards the garage since that’s where the chips were. I go over there and as I’m talking to this lady a group of friends come over and tell me that they can finally fix the issue with the car and it’s low rpms. They actually fix it and one guy starts driving it around but  we lose sight of him (the day has gone from dusk to night time now). All of a sudden we hear a bunch of screams and we rush to the town where everyone has turned into vicious zombie monsters (volatiles) from dying light. As we approach the town closer, the lady we are with starts screaming and turns into a zombie in front of us. I narrowly escape her and start to run into town ( I think I’m looking for someone) into the horde of zombie. They grab my ankles and rip my shirt but I managed to get through a big group. I manage to run around a corner to encounter another group (everyone has turned I think) I turn and jump onto a roof using some zombies and my athletic ability. I’m cornered on the roof and I can only jump out of town into the unforgiving jungle/outskirts. I say screw it and jump over the fence and before I can land. I wake up.",1674353469.0
225,Dreams,Dreaming about being married to an ex.,"Don’t get me wrong: I have no feelings for my ex. I honestly regret ever dating him. We dated for like 2 months, and I broke up with them. 
I keep having dreams where I was previously married to them. In the first dream, I dreamt of getting married to him at parents house. In this recent dream I knew I was divorced, and I was with my now fiancé. The problem Is i couldn’t remember my previous wedding. My sister shows me a video of me and my ex on Christmas and my mom gifting me a black veil. But I could barely picture the previous wedding I dreamt of in the backyard. I think it was only a week later I regretted marrying him so we divorced.",1674353387.0

Just thought it was kinda funny. I also feel like I need to mention that I was in no way careful with the bag. It banged against pretty much every obstacle in my way.",1674350595.0
229,Dreams,Figure Outside the Door,"Hi! On occasion I have dreams where there is someone outside my front door. A few nights ago I had three separate dreams (dreamt, woke, fell asleep, dreamt again, etc.) of similar nature. I was inside my house and could feel a sense of fear/dread and could see a dark, shadowy figure outside my front door...but not really visually see it. I could ""see"" and feel the figure in my mind's eye, if that makes sense. It wasn't trying to break in or even open the door but but I was still urgently pressing against the door as if the figure was trying to push it open. I suddenly realized the door wasn't locked and, in a panic, I locked it, but was afraid to make sound because I knew it would alert the figure to my presence. As soon as I locked it, the fear elevated and I started yelling (not words, just sound - I was yelling in real life and woke up my husband). The yell was fearful but mostly I was trying to scare away the figure. 

Second dream that same night, the figure/shadow was outside my bedroom window. Again, yelling to scare it away.

Third dream, the figure was whispering to me through the Amazon Alexa speaker....I woke up my husband (in the dream) and told him what was happening.  He groggily said, ""tell it to stop,"" and went back to sleep. Woke up feeling scared...

For some reason this series of dreams has sat with me and I can't shake them. It's been about a week but they are low-level nagging me.

I've tried to look up meanings but not even sure what to look up. One thing that kept popping up was intruders....but it wasn't exactly intruding, nor was it necessarily a person. 

Any thoughts?",1674349768.0
230,Dreams,[DreamCollective] My Mother's Tragic Demise [Nightmare] [Death],"Last January 21,2023, I had a nightmare where I witnessed my mother’s death. It started off like a flashback in a film where I relived some good moments with her like my first trip to the dentist where she held my hand with a latex glove balloon, our first shopping spree, and my first theatre performance. 

Then, when we got home, our house was burglarized and before the robbers left, they slit her throat and left me to catch her. 

Then, the scene got blurry and I ended up having to talk to her friends and co-workers at her funeral. But they were all badmouthing her and conditioning me that she was a bad mom and that I shouldn't mourn for her. She wasn't. She was a great mom. 

I hate this. This ruined my Sunday.

231,Dreams,Had a dream I kissed a girl. What could this mean?,"I’m writing this while on vacation in Dominican Republic. I feel asleep, started to dream. In the dream I saw a girl in a tank top with curly hair, blonde highlights crying all alone. I went over to her feeling bad and I hugged her tight in a way she would calm down, then she laid me down on a table saying she liked me and we kissed randomly almost like we were dating for a while. We became bf &amp; gf afterwards, then i woke up realizing it was a dream, sigh, i’m single lol. I’m glad to be anyways tbh though i’ve had a couple crushes recently.

232,Dreams,Survivors Island? Not sure what to make of this dream.,"This was about a girl (myself) being taken to a survive type island. There were other people there and the people who kidnapped us said that we have to play their game in order to leave. We had to find this girl, and she would help us get off the island. So, we start looking around for clues, and it's some extensive shit we had to go through. I don't remember what the first half was I just remember feeling like we had been searching for hours. I was talking to this one guy about pokemon go, when I noticed a rat laying on the landing of this wooden stair case. I walked up to it and it somehow recognized me. I began to follow it down the stairs. I ran ahead, somehow knowing this was the way out. The cave walls looking familiar. I raced with the rat for a few minutes and he takes me to this room. The others were no longer behind me, so I creep into the room unsure of what was about to happen. When I turned the corner this woman was sitting there, smiling from a wooden table. She looked up and said ""It's no surprise you were the one to find me first, very well done"". I asked her what she wanted and she said ""You don't remember?"" I told her that I didn't. She got up, and got close to me, whispering ""Well let me help you then"". And proceeded to take off her clothes. We then had sex. I was all into the moment, when I had flashbacks. Going back to when we had made a plan to trap people on the island. That I was the one to escort the people around to see if they had what it takes to survive. I could see the woman that was with me now, and her husband both talking to me about doing it once more before things would reset. Hoping that this time would fix the future. I pull out of the memories and look up from where I was laying with the woman, her husband was standing there asking if I remembered. She told him yes, that it was coming back to me. He asked if I was ready to take both of them into their bed, and she argued saying I was just supposed to be her toy. He huffed and walked away. Everything blurs and I'm on a train, looking at the ocean. I was back in the prohibition era. I was at the tail end of a train, when the woman's husband came into the room I was sitting in. He was angry. He told me I had to give him what I gave his wife, that it was only fair. When I wouldn't he pulled me through the cars of the train until we reached the front.  We stopped at this run down old train stop. There were a few oil drums on the ground. Laid around in straight lines. Each drum a different color. I knew what they meant but I was too panicked to register what was going on. The husband grabbed my arm hard, told me if I wasn't going to put out for him, then I was going to be sold to the next couple. He slapped me across the face, and chained me to the metal ring that was attached to the drum. I tried to pull away but there was no way out. The train left and I felt like I was waiting there for hours. Just when I'm about to pass out a car pulls up. A woman and a man get out, they walk over to me and expressed their excitement. The woman smiling says ""finally, we've found you, are you ready to do it again?"" I agree knowing that this time I would do things differently. They uncuff me and we get in their car. The dream ends with me understanding that I'm about to go back to that island to try and change the events of the future.",1674346586.0
233,Dreams,Strangest semi NSFW dream,"So... Here goes with some background, don't get scared off 

My friends ex partner is a legitimately attractive lady, have I ever thought of her in any way that's NSFW? No, she's a good friend I just haven't had contact with in an exceptionally long time, I've never been remotely interested in her, being older than me by at the least 10 to 15 years, nope never

Anyway here's the dream

Randomly meeting and talking shit I get given the request, for reasons unbeknownst to me I take the offer up, feeling I suppose a duty, that's the sense I had

And that's where things thankfully fell off a cliff, after going through first and second we move on third, shit moved quick, she steps back and disrobes to expose that she's mostly metal and silicone, silicone like you use to waterproof not fake boobs, but it's falling apart, the silicone strands are old but in a difference to real silicone still wet and not brittle, but looking like it when it gets brittle but moveable

The skeleton is metal covered in this silicone like goo and where you'd expect to see the lower fun bits looks like a metal socket you'd expect to be used as part of a shoulder joint made of metal just pointed downwards,I suppose it looks like a metal female pelvis but being metal it's built for purpose and not to be enjoyed by fleshlings, being able to see in it looks like there's places a guy could easily cut himself

Her daughter intervenes to show me which bits of 'silicone' to play with to give her what I'm obligated to, her fun for lack of a better word, this works agonizingly slow, then she up and vanished and I've got no way to get home

Thankfully I wake up, nothing about this entire experience was fun, other than I suppose for people to read",1674346537.0

I can't remember history of me in any other recording dream set, and I can barely remember real life. It's like I'm a whole new person.

235,Dreams,Need help with a dream that encroaches on my morale,"Hello everyone, my name is Nicolas i’m 21 and i’m from Belgium (sorry for my approximative language i’m not billingual 😅)

I search help in many belgium blogs and a good friend told me to this subreddit. First, I've been thinking about wanting a child for two years. Being a father is something that crosses my mind and I feel a great need for paternity. But i’m only 21 and i am a university student so i can’t raise a child financially. I wait to have a good situation. 

Let’s talk about the dream now. Two days ago, I dreamed that I had a child with my ex-girlfriend (we are in real life as in this dream separate and in bad terms for more than a year). This child is also one year and a few months old. My dream spread over several weeks when I could see all the love I had for my hypothetical son. I played in the park, bordered him, walked, gave him food. It was my reason for living, the most important thing in this world. Everything seemed so true I thought I was living a life for a night. In this same dream, I went to my ex-girlfriend's house one day because it was my week of care. She tells me that my son has passed away. That she tried to tell me at the phone. I got angry I screamed with all my strength I hit walls with my head my fists and my heart was screaming in pain. I started crying without stopping. And the more time passed, the more I cried, my life no longer made sense. When I woke up the next day, I noticed my red eyes and I had a feeling of emptiness in me. I continued to cry all day even if I knew very well that all of this was just a dream. Last night, I had another dream with another girl. We were doing simple shopping in it when I passed a shelf of baby clothes. I cried too. And waking up this morning my sadness and this emptiness are not gone. I feel like if i loose a real child and my mind can’t not rest.

Do you have many solutions for that ? I know it’s difficult to believe a story like this but it’s entirely the pure truth. I really need help. Thanks you for reading this and have a nice week !",1674345577.0

237,Dreams,I had a dream about what happens after I die,"Usually before I am about to die in my dreams I wake up. However this is the first time I have ever dreamed of the after life.
 I was in a river with friends that turned into a waterfall on both sides. We were playing in the river part until one of my friends gets caught in the current and dies. We were all shocked and for some reason in the dream I couldn’t live on without them so I let myself be taken away by the current. After I die to the waterfall in the dream I am surround by dark empty space. It kind of looked like space but there where no plants and no lights it was just me floating in a space of nothingness. 
While floating it felt like I was waiting for something and I’m not exactly sure what it was but it felt like my soul was to be transported somewhere else. It was like I knew that I was supposed to go somewhere but instead I was just floating in nothing. Eventually when after I was just stuck there it felt like my time to move would never come to I ended up coming back to earth as a ghost. 
This was all of the dream I can remember vividly because it happened like 2 months ago. I tried researching about dreaming about after death but nothing really comes up so if anyone wants to have a stab at what this means then go at it.
(I would also like to add that I am a verrryy vivid dreamer. I have dreams almost every day and while it’s great it does affect my perception of reality sometimes. I will have dreams where I live an entirely different life and it feels extremely real.)",1674345283.0
238,Dreams,Multiple movie type recurring dreams,"Guess I’ll start by explaining the ‘movie’ and throwing out approximate plot lines, because this time I forgot like half of them…

If you’d like to try and dream a movie type-ish dream, its a very easy thing to do, just go to sleep in your clothes and use as many blankets as needed, the more you use the more intense the dream may be. And try to fall asleep before feeling ‘hot’.

P.S. Sometimes I am the main character and sometimes I’m the ‘cameraman’.

So like the first movie is basically a group of friends arriving at a cabin near the snowy mountains. They settle in, they notice 2 shot guns lying outside the cabin for whatever reason. One girl notices a scratch on the floor, upon closer inspection its revealed to be a see through hole and she realises that the cabin has been built upon a cave entrance.

This is where I forgot like half of the scenes and I dreamed a side piece of let’s just say unrelated movie plot about me and my mom living in a plaster like house on a cave as well, it gets flooded, I find a kitten and that kitten treats me as the mom, house collapses in the cave - the end wtf ikr.

I’ll write in short lines about the first movie from now on, try to not question them as they use dream logic lol.

&gt;Group of guys decide to take apart their van to clean the parts.

&gt; Its nightime. A girl standing near a window gets ‘snatched’.

&gt; Guys freak out, run out and start shooting with their pistols at the entity.

&gt;More casualities occur

&gt;Its daytime and we get to see the first entity shot dead, which appears to be a wolf of some kind.

&gt; One of the guys get a phone call from the 
 ?repairman? who says the van can’t be repaired yet.

&gt;Inner conflict occurs as deaths could’ve been avoided if they had used the shot guns placed outside.

&gt;A man on a quadbike arrives, sees the ‘furry body’ and condemns the group for killing it, warning the group that there’s nothing they can do now.

&gt;Scene where its nightime and the group decide to split up in the house, they find more cave entrances and ??? happens.

&gt;A group of 3 are seen being rescued by a helicopter in the mountains. The end.



There’s another, my personal, this nightmare that was so surreal I start to cry the moment I even think about it and I’m a grown man. Imagine finding a whole alien catacomb type thing under your whole mansion. I can leave that for later if any of you want to hear it..",1674345175.0
239,Dreams,Crazy factory dream,"I've never had a dream this crazy before. This is kinda a long one but anyways!
 
It started from this large hall. It was a factory of some sort. I guess I worked there, I'm not sure. The boss of the factory was a fluffy orange monster who basically treated the workers like slaves. The day was over, so the monster forced the workers to walk through a hallway that had a long, furnace-like tunnel in it, with forks hanging from its roof. The tunnel would burn you painfully if you walked through.
 
I was very sly tough, I crawled next to the tunnel on a conveyor belt that was actually a piano. The monster didn't notice me so I started running. I ran through three rooms, each filled with colourful ball-shaped cereal. I hid behind the piles of cereal and gobbled it into my mouth like a wild animal.
 
When I was convinced that the monster wasn't after me, I suddenly were in a different place. It was an odd house, I'm not even sure if it was a house at all. But there were some funky staris and I climbed them to see a chalkboard with text on it. I read the text and it said: ""*My body perfume may have a strong scent, but it's more embarrassing that your name is Apple.*""
 
I got down the stairs and found a fluffy yarn ball on the ground. I ate the ball, thinking I was supposed to. I got scared about what was going to happen to me, so I started to look for anyone who knew.
 
Nobody knew what eating yarn did to your body, so I somehow teleported to this beautiful Frutiger Aero styled place. This place was the dentist's office, airport and bathroom at the same time. Everything was white and blue. There was a hallway to a large hall that had a huge 2 on the wall.(That was the bathrooms)  Then there were some other hallways/bridges to nothingness, and in the middle of everything, a floating large circular stage. I went on the ""stage"", and saw dentists.
 
I asked them what happens if you eat yarn. Turns out that the yarn goes to your blood vessels. I was kinda relieved, and looked down from the stage. Underneath there were creatures, they were in a big hall similar to s mall.
 
And then, I woke up.",1674344991.0

Her neck kept flopping back (I even heard a small crack once) and she kept crying, I’m pretty sure once I must have dislocated her arm just from holding her wrong or something and I was so upset and stressed but kind of in a dissociative state that I just popped it back into place. I kept hearing small cracks every time she got hurt too. I ran off to some motel type of place, except everyone gets to know each other and they are all live there full time I think and we all ate together sometimes and stuff. I think it was the same day I got there but it got to darker and I forgot about feeding her and I remember this awful shame and fear. This man I became friends with bought me some things for her the same night and then I fed her. I don’t know why I keep thinking about this I just feel so guilty.

242,Dreams,So yet another tattoo dream (or so I thought),"So I've never used reddit before so forgive me if it's weird but I wanted to share this, so for a really long time idk how long I've been having dreams of getting a tattoo they're usually supper blurry (the tattoo) but more recently I drew a tattoo I'd want in the near future (I'm 18 so it's more possible to be soon!) But besides that when I drew it tonight after a while of not having those dreams I was able to see my tattoo, yeah the bottom of it but I knew it was my tattoo. Anyway this one was weirder than usual for context I've been wanting a tattoo for a while now and of course my parents are like no but I turned 18 back in the fall, in reality it doesn't really matter if I get their permission anymore but it's just a respect thing at this point, back to the dream I basically do my normal of getting up etc. But I go out for a long long drive and end up at a local tattoo place (which is way closer than in my dream) and I walk in handing them a picture of the tattoo I want the guy tells me he'll do it I just have to wait I say alright and sit in this weird backroom waiting area, as I wait I see some friends a really weird combination of good friends and some I just talk to a lot, and then it's my turn I go up the needle touches my skin and then I'm sitting up new tattoo on my upper arm now covered by my t-shirt and the guy gives me lotion to apply to it this is where it begins to get weird every time I use it a strange amount of time passes so OK magic lotion now what I use it once and the tattoo is completely healed and it's been 3 weeks I am absolutely astonished and I leave it why should I use it again if I'm all healed right? But I use it again after my skin on the tattoo is dry, again the tattoo is barely seen throughout the dream and then it gets cut off, I wanna know what it means, why I had this dream now and why I keep think about it it felt so real I had to touch my arm to make sure idk if there's answers but yeah, kinda hope I have another tattoo dream before then it had been like a year and a half but yeah!

The kid got stuck in some escape pod that was going speedy and it made a black hole (idk it’s a dream) 
The child got sucked in and the black hole disappeared. 
The child was born as a baby in this insane looking world, all the colours where really vibrant but the most prominent colour was some reddish/pink/purple colour. Her parents brought this child up and when she could talk she started talking about the 3rd dimension and how that’s where she is from. The parents didn’t believe her but then some how proved it and asked the child if she wanted to go back. She said yeah and then freakly the dream ended. 

Absolutely wild. Unfortunately I can’t quite remember what the 4D people looked like. I remember everything looking kind of like “glass shards” I suppose. It’s Hard to explain. I completely forgot about it till something triggered me to remember later in the day",1674342669.0
244,Dreams,This was too real,"Hello!A little about me (M/25):so some years ago,  i came to the realization that a big percentage of my dreams are nightmares. My life has been difficult, filled with trauma and very gruesome sights and that has caused my brain to get a little bit silly. So ive come to the acceptance that persistent nightmares will just be a thing in my life. But my nightmares are very, human? never monsters or demons or anything paranormal, theyre more of a translation of my traumas or fears into dream-form.

But this one was different, it felt too real, and when i mean real i mean REAL, i really thought i was awake and that i awoke in this place.

In the dream i woke up laying facing up on a sandy beach with clear blue skies, no sun was visible but it was as bright as noon, and without shadows somehow. But everything looked as if it was real, the sand felt like sand, the air smelled salty, it wasnt hot but it wasnt cold either, there was a soft breeze coming from the sea.When i stood up, there was only two things for miles, sand and sea. It was as if the entire earth was half sand and half ocean, and me.I was too stunned to say anything, i didnt know what the f\*\*ck was going on, i was scared but the type of scared that your body doesnt have the means of processing so you just go numb, like a deer in headlights.

I looked to the sea and how its waves never changed size or patterns, and then i saw boats.Boats with stretched faces on the outside of the raft. They had many many teeth and empty holes for eyes. They were many, and empty, they only crashed on the waves but they never moved from their spots.

I just stood there, motionless, emotionless, just watching for what felt like hours. Then i just woke up, i opened my eyes and was like wt\*. The stretched out faces kept playing in my mind for hours so i decided to draw them, why? i dont know.  Im just startled, and very confused and unease. Maybe it doesnt mean anything, maybe it was just my brain doing its silly lil things, but it felt important.

If anyone has any theories or comments id love to read them.(attached drawing i made about it because it freaked me out and need to get it out of my head)

245,Dreams,i remember dreaming about missing out on a campaign,"I was chatting to an old friend i played dungeons and dragons with i asked him hows the campaign he's running because i dropped out, he says it's still running after getting mad at me for dropping out long time discord server long time ago. Anyways my friend offer me to rejoin the campaign and i agree so we went to his room and i asked how far you're party is in, and turns that the campaign just went through a magic highschool arc and the party just graduated and we're planning to do a college arc,  while he's talking about what happened in thr campaign looked at the bed to many comic books on  the bed and the cover contains the player characters from the campaign. Apparently the campaign was broadcast via podcast and it became a huge hit i tried to reach at the comic book to read up but that is the moment when i awoken from my nap.

246,Dreams,Bird man,"So I had a weird dream where there was this old-timey man with a bowler hat, and a really, really well combed mustache. Except it was just his head, and attached to where his neck was supposed to be, there were chicken feet. Anyway, he was sitting in a nest with a seashell next to him.

251,Dreams,Taco Bell,"Note, I've been up for about 5.5 hours now so it's the second half I'm remembering, and even then, it's not everything. 

I had a job at Taco Bell, think it was my first day on the job. I was running late, it was only 10 minutes before my shift and it took 15 minutes to get there. I was freaking out, so my dream dad (not IRL dad) decided to take me. He had a slight dad bod, if you look up Jason Momoa dad bod it was almost exactly like that, just slightly more belly. Anyway, if I had to choose a body type that would be the one I'm most attracted to IRL, and idk if that transferred over to my dream, but while my dad was driving me to work, I was very much cuddly with him. 

We get to Taco Bell, and there were a couple promo signs for pancakes. My dad said something about how he had to try that, so he walked in with me when I started my shift. The actual shift itself I don't remember, but when I was back home I was in a shower, and it was in the bathroom me and my mom used. I noticed there were a lot of things in there that I didn't recognize, so I started going through them.",1674334204.0
252,Dreams,Dreaming of an ex trying to kill me?,So about 5 or 6 months ago I started having dreams of my ex trying to kill me. It stopped for a while but I just had another dream two nights ago. We’ve been broken up for close to 6 years now and I’m in a much healthier happier relationship. The one with my ex was pretty toxic and there was some abuse going on. Over the last two years I’ve accepted that I have some trauma from that relationship. Could that be what’s causing the dreams after all this time?,1674333114.0
253,Dreams,Something is holding me?,"Hello, 

// From time to time I have a weird dream where something is holding me / pulling me to the ground. I always wake up with a high-beating heart (or at least it feels like that). I also feel like I have to fight with it but scarcity always wins and I wake up. 

What I remember from last time. I was behind my desk watching some videos and then suddenly there was a cat (I guess it was mine) I wanted to pet him but suddenly I couldn't move, he was pulling me down I was scared. 

A similar dream happened before where I guess I was a person and that felt scarier. I also remember that once I end up fighting \*it\* and I felt like I did a good job. It always feels like some kidnap or something like that. Like that ""thing"" is behind me. // 

It doesn't feel like a nightmare I  guess it was a chilled dream every time but then suddenly some twist and this holding ... eh 

Edit: I forget to add that when there is that holding I hear some sort of screaming like “aaahhhh” in creepy way. And that’s most likely the scary thing not that holding itself but that sound.
\----------

That was the main part. Now some extras

Strangely when I smoke weed I noticed cats look at me / behind me differently than usual. Like they see something. (This can be only my weed imagination, and also while being high there is much more weird stuff happening to me, especially, I'm paranoid af, but that's a different topic ). 

Also now I remembered one different dream where I was hiding/running away with Andrew Tate (lol) and when they catch me and was questioning me I had weird feelings like in [Cyberpunk Braindance](https://youtu.be/eWJJo5F166A?t=70) (1:13 in this video) and then I woke up again (will sound weird but it felt like Agent Smith from Matrix, but it was some woman, also I have been watching matrix (even tho I'm not sure if I was watching matrix before or after this dream happened).

Also, another dream was about a snake chasing me and when it jumped on me I again woke up. This stuff with the snake was also weird. It was like on the corner of some building it looked like a gutter pipe and many people were walking around and it always attacked some of them, I was sitting on a bench with someone and we were looking at that snake and then it started chasing us.

But that thing that is holding me is giving me really creepy vibes. Sometimes I can't even go back to sleep because I think that something gonna happen. It's just a dream, right? And this is reality nothing is gonna happen...",1674330951.0

258,Dreams,My dream about a game,"I had a dream here i was in grandma's house but it wasn't really her house. I think it was from a game but there was a room with a bunch of mirrors and you would photograph if you see like something weird was in the mirrors.
This time was different i was with a group and the house was starting to get repossed or destroyed. Anyway how the game would end is that i would reach the roof but a little bit before that and the mirror room me, grandma and the group were walking near a not so big cliff to the ocean. So grandma thought it would be fun to dive into the water but she backed out at the last minute, but two lil'dog brothers dived into the water and they started sinking. One of the brothers stoped moving immidiately but the other brother clinged onto him. I was looking down and started waving i don't know if was like a ""goodbye"" or a ""hey are you ok?"" wave. But the still moving brother looked with a sad frown and was waving at me and slowly they both sank till i coulded see them anymore. And we moved on and then we were at like a park inside the house? We walked and then grandma turned into a vampire and was talking to me i didn't remember what we talked about. So we reached and got passed the mirror and now we were on the roof and the demolition was getting worse. And i had a relization that i wouldn't get to do this game anymore so i hugged grandma and ""i'm going to miss you"". 
After that i don't really remember and then i woke up.",1674326601.0
259,Dreams,"Living an entire life, being beheaded, coming back to life, and remembering the pain after waking up.","Ok so, last night I was playing siege with my friends, and went to bed at \~0. I assume this was the last dream that I had last night, but I'm not entirely sure.  I can't really remember how it started, but it must have been around when I was 20 In my dream. It was set in a post-apocalyptic world, but instead of being like the fallout series, It was many years past that. Society was In the medevil age, and (maybe?) had magic, It wasn't entirely clear, because nobody ever talked about it. I was a prince, but I was bored with life, so I went to one of the ancient ruins of an amusement park, which had criminals and pirates living in it. I went to one of the water rides (that was still somehow filled with water). It was like a river in a huge open cave, and the river went all over the cave, with what used to be little set pieces being used by pirates to store and sell treasure and food. I have a small wooden boat, that just kind of  had to go with the current of the river. So while I was on the river, I saw this other boat with three people in in, a girl, and two men. Their boat was unstable and could've flipped over at any moment, and they saw me, who's boat could only fit one more person without being unstable, and they begged me for help, of to which I obliged. They told the girl to get in my boat, because she had her whole life ahead of her. I can't exactly remember what anybody looked like except for their faces, now this girl had a pretty face with brunette hair and green eyes, and now, come to think of it, I don't think I knew anybody's names either, anyways, back to the dream. So I have this girl in my boat now, and she's kind of a dick, but eventually she grows on me and we leave the place together, after I traded for a better boat from one of the pirates who were selling boats. Me and the girl were talking to   eachother in a feild, until we saw a dark figure and two snake people (which is what caused me to assume there was magic) and these snake people were talking to the figure. Me and the girl overheard this figure talking to the snake people, and that they were looking for someone, and it turns out that she was the one that they were looking for. The dark figure turned around and looked behind him, and I saw that he was my father (the king), and I must've really loved this girl in my dream, because I didn't turn her in, instead we ran to the mountians, where there was a tiny ski lodge, and about 3 people skiing down this really dangerous ski path. One of the skiiers fell over because he hit a rock or something, and cracked his skull open within full view of me and this girl, and it was disgusting. After hiding in the little log cabin that was supposted to be a ski lodge, we heard a comotion outside, with people yelling and dogs barking. It was the search force, and they found her and I was going to get in trouble for harboring a fugitive. We were taking to the castle to be executed, and I remember the executioner didn't use an axe, but instead he used a sword with swords sticking out of it. I remember the feeling of the swords slicing through my neck, severing my brainstem, and being consious after my head was off, I remember my last words were going to be ""At least I get to die with someone I love"" because the girl was next to me, but I only got so far as saying ""at least I get to d-"" because after that, my head was off, and I couldn't speak anymore. I remember waking up in a coffin, with my head reattached, and a pain in my neck, after that, I woke up. Is there any way to forget the pain I felt while being decapitated?",1674326401.0

261,Dreams,A dream about a sport,"Note: this was actually a dream


It was like any other day. I was age 11 for aome reason. People flying around. On a very sunny day (it was always sunny, day or night)  on an island. There's was this road at the end of my road (irl) that's very steep. I, dream decided to make a sport.

Sport rules. 
Due to everyone being able to fly. The ball is neutral buoyancy in the air. You may use any part of your body to score or pass. And you cannot go below the goal on the right side. So there are two sides. The goal is in the middle. To score, you must go to the enemies' side to shoot it in. But you can't go to your side to shoot it in. https://imgur.com/a/GzLbZAy is it unfair to the right side? Probably

So me and a few friends started up this game have some fun after school. But friends invited friends, and eventually, the games turned into 20 v 20s and 30 v 30s with hundreds of spectators. I was kinda like the headmaster of it all, making sure people didn't wreck shit like the net. I, of course, hired refs, scorekeepers, and all that shit out of my own money. But i still organized shit and made tournaments and collected donations for prize winnings. It was very much a kid's game, ran by kids, for kids to play and watch. No adults to be seen.

Until one day, they (adults) decided to do what I can only describe to kidnap the game. They charged people shit at my own game, threatened kids to leave if they were too loud, hosted tournaments that people thought I was hosting. Everybody thought these were my changes, but I tried to convince everyone it wasn't, but everyone praised me not knowing the quality of the games were more shit, they were just monetized. It was still public property as it was on a road, but still. It all ended this faithful day (where it was actually nighttime for once) where during a game on New Year's eve. A bunch of adults came down to tear out the goal post and we all heard the bulldozers behind us and ran (flew) away. 

At that moment, I prayed to the gods, and one of them answered. I asked to turn back time to the day I started up the game. He obliged

I went back to the day we had the idea to start up this game, except I wasn't there. There was another girl there that wasn't there before(we'll call her hannah). As the adults began to settle with their stupid monetization schemes, Hannah was on board with it. She wanted the stuff that happened before to happen again. I tried really really hard to stop her, but she insisted, blinded by money. On New Year's eve. I went, and all I saw were corporate shops and brainwashed people. I warned her that this was a dumb idea. She insisted yet again, so I gave up. I flew up really high and took out a paraglider, and I saw about 20 people doing the same thing I was during just at a way lower altitude. I actually cried in the dream. This was my second chance and I fucked it up and now my favourite sport, the one I made, is now forever lost.",1674325586.0

267,Dreams,"Had a really long, complicated dream that felt like the plot to a weird movie. It involved being aware that I was in the dream world.","It began with running into a pitch black computer digital maze while hiding from other entities. The only thing with light in the maze was the computers themselves, and the lights weren't bright at all. To see yourself you had to get extremely close to them. After escaping that part of the maze a digital girl grabbed me and took me to more normal looking room. 



It was a small classroom with a desk and a chalk board, and the windows were blacked out. It was suspended in the air in a brightly lit hall after the computer maze. She pushed me in it and locked the doors and then tried to explain to me what was going on. She said this was the digital dream world and that other dream characters can't see me or I would get arrested because real people aren't supposed to be there. I accidentally opened the door while looking out the window back at the maze and some entity in the maze saw the light from our room and so the digital girl told me I had to go to the next part of the world. She told me to stay in the shadows, because this next part was a more cartoony dream maze designed like a city. Stay in the shadow alleys and don't go into the light until she gave me the signal. So then I was pushed into it and did as she said, slinking around the alleys. 



There were people in the alley, but because I was in the shadows they couldn't tell who I was or what I was. Everyone in the shadows was a silhouette. The alleys took the form of big dark orange buildings. The street out was also dark orange, and on the other side of the street was a more normal yellow colored cartoony city with various cartoony characters walking around. Once she found me again she gave me the disguise of a mid 30s office working man and told me to blend in. She then pushed me forward into the alleys and left me to fend for myself. I stayed hidden in the alleys while examining what was going on around me now. I noticed the dark orange buildings to the right of me had a door, and one door was open, shining light that everyone avoided. A silhouette that looked like Timmy Turner was walking into the door next to a silhouette that looked like Kanye West. I decided to go forward, and once I touched the light I was brought to a more realistic world, but still not quite right. This world was more like a live action movie that was still cartoony in spirit. 



I was in the back of a front office of what looked like the police department of the live action movie world. The guy sitting at the front desk noticed me but told me to get back to work so I pretended to go while I actually explored the office. As I explored I found a bathroom, and while in the bathroom I overheard a woman talking about the push pin spies and how they were successfully infiltrating the staplers. Turned out the live action city I was in was the staplers and the push pins were the enemy. So I found the window open in a toilet stall and looked down and found the push pin spy, who was a Russian lady who looked like Natasha from Rocky and Bullwinkle (the live action one) in a white button down shirt and black tie. 



I somehow made a push pin weapon from one of my staplers and threw it down at her, getting it in her eyes. Then I jumped out of the window onto the ground below and noticed she was smiling. Somehow she grabbed my police badge and swapped it for a push pin badge and was going to make a run for it until I caught up to her and used the push pin weapon I made to kill her. I stole her notes and then noticed I was caught by an old security guard lady who looked like Betty White who was trying to get into the building to report it to the head police officer, so I pushed her over and had to knock her out. I then made a run for it down the street. The city looked like the set of an early 2000s family movie and the ""camera"" of the dream matched the look. Things began to fall apart at this point and I woke up.",1674323127.0
268,Dreams,Working in the library,"Hey guys,

Before I start, I just wanted to thank you for reading.  It is a wild dream and includes threats of penis cutting, and although it was high stress it is not a nightmare to me as I prefer stressful dreams.
============================

So I started by going to work where I met some new hires who were really cool.  I work in a call center and I also do emails.  While I was working I was given some baked goods by a new employee for some reason.  I was making friends.

From there, I noticed my schedule had more email time on it than normal and I talked to my manager.  We left it as is.  I went and sat down to do my work. I think this is about the time my workplace turned into a giant library.

I logged out for lunch and when I came back I was approached by a woman in a niqab (the muslim women’s garb that covers them head to toe with a mask). This was before I could log back in.  Anyways, another employee and I were sitting there and she asked me “so you don’t think you need to go through security?” In reference to phone security.

I then apologized and she was being rude to the person next to me.  I asked her for her name.  That is when she told me “she forgot”.  As we were in a work place and security was on my mind, I dragged her to a security desk and explained the situation, where they locked her up.

From there EVERYONE saw it and had something to say.  Many were campaigning for me to be fired just based on the girls race.  Many were saying I did the right thing.  It ended up being like school seeing years old faces.

This included someone we will call C.  She hared me in high school for my political views which I will not reveal.  She and her friend that I was friends with were talking to me and C was working in the legal department of my company trying to get me fired.  I went through her and various other people describing the situation.

I ended up going back to the front and seeing another specific manager who thought I did the right thing.

When I went back, C was waiting for me with a group of others.  I assumed that I was in the right considering the circumstances and that is why she gathered a mob.  She told me that for what I did and considering who I am, that they were going to chop off my penis.  

I then fought to get out of the crowd including biting.  I ran away.  I went somewhere else again and lost my way.  This last part is a bit hazy and might be somewhere in the story but I remember eventually running past an entire band and yelling some type of war cry as I jumped over 100 story tall book shelves.  That is when I realized I was lost and needed to get back to my computer for the last time.  To get clocked back in for lunch as my shift was nearly over.

I made it.  I then left by weaving through crowds and I had a knife.

I got outside and saw an old drug dealer ex friend who was crazy.  I tried to tell him I was attacked and he simply told me to be careful who i talked to.  When I asked if he was part of the legal opposition he said no but that he was technically a liability.

Somewhere in this dream as well I was running around naked lol.",1674322105.0
269,Dreams,Any dream insight?,"I keep dreaming about being controlled. Controlled by men specifically. Last night, I was at home when I was getting messages from these men on my phone, but kept ignoring them. Then, it turned out that the man wouldn’t stop pursuing me, no matter how much I told him no. NO. NO. NO. 

Suddenly, he replicated and all of these beings came to get me. I tried to escape from them, but they found me and forced me to be with him. When I asked was with ‘him’, he went to protect me, but ended up dying. Men were arguing over child support (??) in Russia.

I escaped from that fate and went to Russia where I was naked. They gave me a blanket and I wandered around until I was suddenly lifted into the air and all of a sudden taken to New Mexico. 

I was transformed into this gremlin-like character where I said, “All I need to do to exit is change my mindset” essentially. 

I was then transported to Target where I had to ask people for help and talk to people to figure out who it was that I needed to talk to leave that target and get on a train to return home to Arizona (I don’t live in AZ???).

Only, I was too afraid to talk to people. There was a bag where I could write and ‘talk’ to whoever’s punishment this was on me. That was forcing me to be here and acknowledge these fears, except when it basically said “do it” a girl came and took it. 

I started talking to people only to get ignored or something thrown at me. Then, I had an anxiety attack, which I felt in the dream. 

This one woman started singing a song which I finished. She asked me to be friends and then I later decided I was going to rely on her, asking her to take me to the train station. She sighed and said, ‘sure.’ We went in her car which started flying over this magical landscape until we reached a city. 

She said that she needed to acknowledge that she was attracted to women and asked if I wanted to date her. She said that she had been having these dreams for several weeks and it was the first of men to pay for my sins in waking life. This was the ‘cardinal sin’ or the ‘original sin’. Whatever that means.

And then I woke up.",1674321807.0
270,Dreams,I went from having fun in my dream to literally dying to a meteor and experiencing a peaceful death,"(This is formatted weird because i wrote it on my phone sorry)
Not even 10 minutes ago i just woke up from my dream, I don't remember the beginning of my dream anymore because the last thing i can vividly remember is my dream. Most of the time i have very vivid dreams so this was insane, I remember i was in a large hotel that was somehow separated by gender for school and i was exploring around and i somehow found one of my exes younger brother and talked to him.

He was talking about how his family had gotten worse, she's insanely strict and him and his brother have to watch how they act around her now. It was so bad to the point where he can't play games anymore. After reconnecting with him the scenery changed. I was sitting on the roof with him and my current new ex boyfriend, we were all just sitting down and talking about something random.

And then we saw a car crash fight happening in front of us, the crash was intentional because they kept purposely ramming their cars into each other, the hoods of their cars were literally opening and one of them in the car was purposely leaking gas everywhere onto the road during the whole thing and when they were done they lit up the trail of gas and it created a pathway of where they were intentionally ramming their car.

My first reaction was ""Wtf why are they crashing into each other"" and then instantly the next was to take a photo, i had asked for a phone because i left mine somewhere and then my current ex pulled out his phone but somehow i couldn't take a photo cus it looked so crappy so my ex took the photo for me an we were laughing and then seconds later we saw the most brightest, largest and closest meteor ever.

It passed by us in the sky, there were also a lot more other people besides us now because of the crash and other people in their cars too. I remember we were all saying, ""Wow."" because of the sight and it was beautiful until a few seconds later the meteor had swerved around and it was getting closer and closer to us. We all finally realised in a panic,""We're going to die."" At first we had thought it was small but it was getting larger and brighter, we all got up and tried to run away in the few seconds but the meteor had already impacted.

I get blown off the roof from the impact of the meteor and i tried to hold my grip against the roof because i was flying off from the edge, but how somehow i managed to die from the waves it radiated off from the meteor. Everything had felt like it was fading in my body, my last thoughts were ""Oh i'm dying, i don't want to die. I guess this is the end, i'll accept it. I wonder what's in the end."" I could feel in my dream that my body was being destroyed but not painfully, it was as if my life were fading in real time. A few seconds after experiencing death, i had gulped in real life and i woke up.",1674320789.0
271,Dreams,Had the most vivid dream I've ever had and now I dearly miss the child I had that doesn't exist,"Background: 23M from USA. Currently engaged and have plans to have children, but probably not for a few more years. 

Had a dream that I had a one night stand while I was in college. Current fiancee and I apparently in this dream had never met. Girl got pregnant from it. She was a catholic girl who wanted to keep the baby, but for some reason (dream logic i guess) never informed me about it.

 Cut to 3 1/2 years or so later and woman apparently dies suddenly in an accident, so her family discovers that I am the father and let's me know. So I go to meet my daughter and she looks like a toddler, female version of me, so I instantly know it's mine. 

Her name was Anna and she was so cute and now I miss her. 😭😭😭

I remember talking with my friends in the dream about how I hadn't anticipated having a child this young or being a single dad, but she was so amazing that I wouldn't trade it for anything. I literally lived out years of my life in this dream, all the way up until she was 7 year old or something, so now it just feels like a part of me is missing. 

Now I'm depressed and sad about my daughter that never existed. Don't know why I'm posting but was just looking for a place to vent and maybe if someone knows what this dream might mean. I'm not a superstitious or religious person, but something about this dream is sticking with me.",1674320469.0

274,Dreams,Childhood recurring dream,"This is a dream that I would have once every year for some reason on Easter morning I would wake up remembering having dreamed this dream during the night. The drink came to me about three maybe four years in a row but I definitely remember having it at least three times.

I have no idea what psychologically would have caused something like this to happen and I'm interested in that after finding this subreddit it's actually a common enough occurrence for there to warrant a whole tag for it.

The dream would always be very short or at least I wouldn't remember the earlier details of the dream only the later ones or the most important details of it but in this dream:

I was in my elementary school with all the other students maybe at recess for something when men and black suits with red ties and guns came up to the school and forced us all into the school. The men in the suits would start to build giant walls made out of bushes and leaves around the school in a giant ball. After accomplishing this they would stand around the grass and leaf wall guarding it making sure none of the kids tried to escape while they proceeded to fill the ball with water effectively filling the entire school and the ball with water. At some point I would get brave and I would try to escape to save my life I would try to drill a hole with my hands through a part of the wall I thought was unguarded by the suit men unfortunately upon getting through the wall I would be met by it the feet of a suited man with a gun and then I would wake up in a panic state.",1674317696.0

276,Dreams,Dream I thought I was dreaming but wasn’t,"This was the craziest feeling I’ve ever had while dreaming. 

I “woke up” in my dream and looked at my phone only to see pictures of what I thought was a dream was real. 

So basically, I go into this school for which is supposed to give me some instruction for what is the thing I’m not sure. Part of it was nail tech and makeup part was tattooing and part of it which really makes no sense to me was shoe cleaning and fixing( like the people who take the old Nikes and make them look brand new) the first three things I’m into the last Im not really sure how that came up. 

I start getting brought around the place by the head lady, getting introduced to people there but at some point I realize I’m topless. I get brought into this side room where they have some random clothes hanging up and laying around on chairs. She brings over a couple shirts and I try both on. The one sorta fits but is tight. Then I wonder over to a rack with this huge puffy pink dress that was stunning and say I’m gonna try it on. It fit perfect and all the girls are behind me telling me how good i look in it. I keep it on and walk over to the tattoo part of things. I watch some girls doing tattoos for a bit joking around then all of a sudden i “wake up”

I wake up on a couch next to my fiancé in a brick wall apartment on the 2nd floor of somewhere because in front of me was a giant window where you could tell you were up at least one floor. I start telling him about my dream and he says that it wasn’t a dream, I look at my pictures on my phone to see that I have a picture of me in the pink dress and he was telling me all about what he did yesterday and wondered why I didn’t remember. I then start floating in and out of consciousness freaking out because clearly something was very wrong with me. I start convulsing and  He jumps up and gets me aspirin for some reason and gives me like a hand full of it. I tell him I need to go to the hospital. Then we jump to me and him being at my parents telling them I’m going to the hospital and the dream ends.

279,Dreams,Interpretation?,"I don’t usually remember my dreams, ever. Last night I had a very coherent &amp; memorable one though, it wasn’t too long from what I remember but it’s been making me think a lot 

I’m in the city &amp; W my old friends that I used to run with. We’re supposed to be going out to eat but people are worried about what I’m wearing. Like it’s too flashy &amp; we’re in the enemies neighborhood (I think it was a brown polo I was wearing) they tell me to change my clothes for something less affiliated until I get upset &amp; that pestering ultimately stops.

The fine details are lost to me at this point but my group is eventually found by a rival gang. They’re only asking me questions since I was the one being so brazen &amp; open with my disrespects. A large African man, I mean intimidating large but almost fatherly walks into view and sits infront of me. Obviously the leader I’m shaking since I feel nothing but fear. In a very calm &amp; almost soothing voice he asks me to hold out my hand. He drops a ring into it with an inscription. It’s sorta crumpled as of a car ran it over or if someone big stepped on it. The inscription was English but was some Islamic words of wisdom. I really wish I had memorized what it said. 

I was raised catholic by my Mom and grandma, in that part of Mexico where she comes from people are still vehemently faithful to god. I never had a bad experience with the church so I consider myself catholic I guess &amp; I believe in Jesus I suppose.

I start to examine the ring as the man in front of me is patiently waiting for me to answer. It’s almost like a trick question, his subordinates are snickering &amp; making comments. Doubting I can even read it. I get the feeling that many people have been asked this question but too many get it wrong, if I give the wrong answer now there will be consequences, I won’t be accepted. The wording of the question almost made it a trick, saying the answer candidly without thinking seems wrong. After abit I say “to make your own purpose in life?” Such a simple answer I expected it to be wrong but his face lights up &amp; he smiles saying “finally!” Then goes into a rant explaining about how I can create my own subjective reality by owning &amp; completing my goals all the whole making references or quoting Islamic scripture.

292,Dreams,Dream #2: Anime Party,"**Scene 1:**

We're in a plane, a woman of my age and me, travelling to some distant house, like Bjork's house in Elliðaey Island. The plane doesn't land there, we go down using a rope. I am supposed to take this woman to the house because there lives an old and wise hairdresser, with whom this woman is supposed to study. We get there, and he is cheerful and happy to see us, but he refuses to take her in, he says he does not accept women as disciples.

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene 2:**

We get out; ""we"" is my father, my female cousin and her daughter, and me; we get out from the building I now live. We are going to a party, an anime convention organized by a popular anime forum (that I used to use in real life). My cousin is on the telephone, talking with someone who also wants to come, she says she will try to get her tickers once we get there, if there are any left. Later, she says something along the lines of ""I am happy this reunited our family"".

&amp;#x200B;

**Scene 3:**

I enter the party. I have to go to a table to register. I see some people are registering to act as interviewers: they will do interviews to japanese celebrities here. I ask if I need to know japanese to do interviews, which I want to do hoping to meet a celebrity on whom I have a mild crush, but they say yes, so I keep walking.

&amp;#x200B;

This house is a series of room lined up. I go through them all, but I don't stop in any, I just keep walking. There are some people there, talking, but it's relatively quiet. As I walk, I see some acquaintances, but I don't want to say hi, I don't feel like talking, so I ignore them and keep walking. I reach the last room, and then start to walk my way back, there isn't much to do there for me.

On my way back I see a bookshelf, one of the books grasps my attention, it s a Spanish translation of ""How Equal Temperament Ruined Harmony"", but I don't stop and keep walking. When I'm in a room that is about in the middle of this series of room, I find there are more bookshelves and mostly devoted to children's magazines, there's a vast collection of Anteojito magazines, stories, albums, books, etc. (this being a popular Argentinian franchise of magazines and other content for children's, that my parents used to buy me when I was a child). First thing I notice is how expensive everything is, I could not afford any of these. I sit and start to check them out, flipping through the page, with both interest and nostalgia. An unknown woman of about my age comes and sits as well, we don't talk, just hand each other magazines and children's books, and we read them for a while before grabbing another one. This last for a while. After we're done, I say I am going to the back (or last) room, and ask her if she wants to come. She says no, with indifference. I feel indifferent too.",1674307797.0

I was playing basketball with my friends on the road then this dude on a motorcycle begged me to help this girl in the dance by becoming her dance partner since her supposed to be partner stood her up/didnt come. 

So, i came back to the party. Then the dream jumped and it was few years later. I was outside my house about to leave and go somewhere, I was wearing heavy clothes since apparently it was cold, then the girl from the dance was behind me, hugging me. We were both really happy and laughing around. And the dream is still so vivid and i could still feel her warmth.

i also had a dream about these maggots coming out of the neck of pepole at a party and we all had to kill them , eventually we used bikes to squish them , until the last one was rithing and spazzing in a really offputting way before it stopped moving ...

a dream i had before was about this really large moth with almost human eyes that was following me and moved it's wings in a weird rithm i checked it using a metronome and it was somewhere between 165 and 170 bpm , wich is faster than many birds , but slower than insects ...

i ask why do i dream this ? i am not scared of bugs , and i don't think i watch them too much daily ...

i also just have disgusting dreams more ofthen than the avarage person it would seem :   
i had a dream about this old woman with a massive pregnant belly giving birth to an adult when i was little , 

and in general many others with really offputting imagery that somentimes just made it's harder to even eat in the morning , and in general it's hard to stop thinking about those images ...

do you have any clue as to why these things happen ?   
any advice to stop them ?

As a window  to the other realm, to my own soul. Many of my dreams are visions, and eerily accurate. So many things made sense after I interpreted my dreams. But some dreams really don't make sense at all. 

Last night I dreamt, that I was at an occasion and my fiancés cousin appeared. And then a few moments later he was holding me up and I kissed him on the lips. And we said that we are getting married instead. And in my dream, I had thoughts on how to tell the family etc. 

When I woke up , I was creeped out for the whole day, because the kiss  felt real. I can still feel it! 
The surreal thing about is, believe me or not, I never ever fantasised about my fiancés cousin . EVER! 
We get along well, and we have performed together on two events. Because we are both musically talented.  
He isn't my type and I'm sure not his. The only thing I find attractive about him
Is his political views, and his strong build from taking part in building his family home. He is manly, but I like that about men in general . My fiancé is very manly too. 
We bonded very much during the pandemic, because we were in the minority with our views but We are like friends. Honestly nothing more. So how did my mind come up with this!?

There was a couch set up in the middle and hanging candles lit up the whole church. It was so strange because I couldn't look at their faces but I knew it was my family and I could hear their voices. Anyway, I already knew I was in a dream so I didn't care much about what was happening around me. But then someone sat in front of me and I wanted to see if he knows he's in my dream? So I asked him, ""What are you doing here?"" I wasn't specific in that question but he answered me with ""I have 3 kids"". I was like, ""Okay?.. But what are you doing IN MY DREAM?"" and he looked at me with his eyes growing wider with the expression on his face that looked like ""How did she know she's in her dream? How did she know she's in my world?""  I followed up a question as fast as I could because I was slowly feeling like he's going to send me back. I asked him, ""How are you in my dream? I don't even know you!"". Right there, I felt like I was being sucked out of that dream and I woke up catching my breath, my eyes wide, and I was scared. After that, I couldn't stop thinking about it and I just can't help but feel like he's connected to my future. I have a big feeling that he is going to be my future husband or IDK. It feels like the children he was talking about are our future children.

BRO IDK ITS CRAZY BUT THAT'S HOW STRONGLY I FEEL ABOUT HIM. I will never forget his face.",1674291204.0
307,Dreams,I have been having reoccurring dreams about being back in high school (4+ years later),"I'm having very vivid and odd dreams lately and one of them is me being back in high school and (sometimes elementary) time, and time, and time again. This has been going on since I graduated in June of 2018 at least 1 occurrence every week.

&amp;#x200B;

Background

My primary education experience in k - 12 is very complicated, as I never exceeded a 70% or higher on most classes. FYI - I have been diagnosed with major depression, autism(Asperger's) and turrettes/adhd and for an overwhelming majority of the time these diagnosis were obvious, and making all of my experiences in the school system much, much, worse. I was initially at the Perkiomen valley school district for elementary school, however my disabilities (notably autism/turrettes) got so bad, and so out of hand, my family moved to another part of Pennsylvania among other reasons. (This particular chapter in my life is very complicated and sad and I might continue in another subreddit). I was then in another elementary school for 3rd and 4th grade, and finally from 5th grade until graduation I kept at one district.

&amp;#x200B;

I did include my background of education because I do think it helps to understand my dream situation more accurately. Anyways, here is the dream situation In detail.

Ever since maybe the week after I actually graduated, I've been having dreams were in a nutshell I'm called back into high school because I took a extra curricular classes that I apparently did not actually finish(4+ years ago), and the state implemented a new law that you cannot graduate if you do not complete at least 2 extra curricular activity's. The thing is, I ACTUALLY NEVER had the chance for extra curricular activates in real life. I was forced into remediation classes instead of electives per say. Then, in the dream I go about trying to prove that I do have a diploma and I don't need to go through this. This happens literally every time I have this dream, were I have to talk to the administrators and the school superintended about leaving me be. There is another twist (again), in the dream, the electives I decided to take 4+ years ago are now required for a ""new and actual diploma"". Therefore rendering my old diploma completely worthless. Another twist, I never actually pass the classes in the dream, I never get close to passing. My grades for the classes are like around 20% according to a couple dreams that I can remember looking up my grades. I remember my old special education teacher (who is arguably my favorite teacher i've ever had) be disappointed in me in the dreams for ""being 22 in high school"" etc, etc. Which is very disturbing.

&amp;#x200B;

This is kind of were this ends, there is so much detail, so much vivid times were I can remember a lot of the sayings and dialog, school building itself, which btw, the dream always has my actual high school as the setting. And all in all, its just a never ending loop of hell. Get called back to high school to get a new diploma and fail the classes and be stuck In high school for eternity. This post literally made my skin crawl as to odd this dream situation is. 

Does any of you guys know what's going on here? I tried to look stuff up like this but never really got a straight answer because all dream are different. If any of you do have some phycological explanation for it, maybe emotions or whatever, please comment. I'm posting this because I'm curious about this.",1674290756.0
308,Dreams,Apocalypse/Alien invasion Dream,"Ive just woke up, and it was probably the most realistic dream ive had in years.

I was living with my Family in a relatively ""expensive"" flat.

We had a hardware store under our Appartment the store was on Ground Floor.

The Apocalypse has just started, and we've seen it all over the news, people have died, and for some reason, nuclear explosions occured.

We stayed at our house, me, my mom and my little niche. For some reason my Sister wasnt there, but i can still remember she was there before when we looked at the news togheter.

I obviously couldnt sleep because we were probably dying if we missed an announcement or something.
So i was wandering in the Store under our Flat.
Ive noticed some noises, in the store but it were only Kids, who were searching for a place to hide.

Under them was a girl somewhere in the range of 12-16, she was older than the other kids, and she had a very expensive and beautiful chain, ive taken the kids up to the flat, and gave them some food and something to drink.

Strangely the next thing i remember is how from the kids the girl is the only one left, my mother and my niche were gone before us to the west. (I live in Germany, and they told us to go to france).

The street lights were going off district by district, and the district next to us was the next.

Then i made the first contact with something unidentifiable. It simply wasnt from this earth.

It was flying inside our shop and was somewhat of a drone, but without any aerodynamical sense.

I was scared, so i took a baseball bat and beat it to the ground, i knew if theres someone watching on the other side they would by now know that i was hostile and they would search for me.

So i packed everything i would probably need for survival, and took the girl with me downstairs to my Motorcycle, we packed it with supplies (how much a motorcycle can handle), and drove out of the garage right next to my shop.

While driving out i would hear a clingy metal noise, like something falling to the ground, when i was driving (like 100m away) the girl screamed her chain was missing. She told me it was expensive and her grandfather gave it to her, so i uturned instantly and drove back to the store where it was lying on the ground infront of the store. I was going pretty fast. 

When we were on our way to france (for some reason there was ocean between germany and france and a large bridge).

We stopped infront of the bridge, because everything was blocked with people trying to escape. 

I remember how i looked back to our street where we lived in like every 100m

And i would see how the lights were going off house by house, street by street.

In my dream i knew i needed to protect the girl for some reason, but i didnt figure out why. I just did it.

When we were at the bridge. My dream ended, the last ""picture"" i could remember was probably Jets and Tanks going to the ""Dark Districts"".


This was the most realistic dream i had thus far, it wasnt really a nightmare, i felt uncomfy but it wasnt so bad i needed to wake up or i woke up sweaty or crying etc. (Wich occured some time ago)

309,Dreams,"Have you ever had a ""clairvoyance"" dream of future events?","Hello guys, this is my first time posting here on Reddit in general and I want to share something that happened to me in 2020. By the way, english it's not my first language so I'm sorry for any mistake in advance. 

I've always had strange dreams since childhood, like very significant dreams (for example: messages or a visit from people that already passed away), but since the pandemic started in 2020 they became more frequent and I had one specific dream that caught me out of guard.

Obs: my father passed away in 2016 so everytime I mention him during the story keep in mind that he wasn't alive anymore during 2020.

I think it was around July 2020 I had a dream I was running away from a storm and I found a hospital which I decided to hide inside. There, I went to the elevator to the 4th floor and as soon as the door opened I was in front of a Hospital Bed with a patient there. 

The patient was a man, his skin color was black and it looked like he was around his 50s. I sit right next to his bed and he woke up  (the hospital bedroom was dark with all the lights turned off except from the light of the moon coming from the window behind his bed). We started to talk about the most trivial things, like the weather, the news, etc, and it was kind of a fun time besides his current condition. However, in the middle of the convo, the elevator's door opened up and my father was right there looking at us.

My father passed away as a old man so his ""fixed"" appearance is quite like a white man in his 60s+, sometimes he appears in my dreams, like a visit, and the same thing happened during this dream. He asked if he could join us, took a chair and sit next to the patient bed as well. We restarted the conversation, and all of this last around a couple of minutes, until my father got up and said:

- ""Okay, time to go now, I will go ahead and wait for you there and prepare everything. Really soon they will pick you up, don't worry, I will be there waiting for your arrival"" (he said looking to the patient)

Then, my father said a quick goodbye to me and entered the elevator again and the numbers on the top elevator were increasing like he was going to a higher floor. I look towards the patient again but now we were more quite, he just said thank you for my company and we started to wait.

Minutes later the elevator opened once again, and strangely about 5 people came out of it wearing regular clothes but they were acting like nurses, they started to prepare the patient go take him into the elevator, also they totally of ignored me there haha. He said goodbye to me and was taken to the elevator with all that people. I was left alone in that hospital bedroom and after that I woke up.

Everytime I have a dream with my father I like to tell in details to my mother so as soon as I woke up I went out of my bedroom to find her. However, my mother was all dressed up in black almost like she was ready to go somewhere. She said to me something like:

- ""Good! I was about to wake you up. I will have to left you alone today because I received a call that an old friend of mine passed away and now I'm going to his funeral"".... I was like 💡🧐

I told her about my dream very quick and she was curious to check if the patient I've had dreamed of was her old friend... BOOM! She opened his Facebook and right after I stare to his profile picture I knew it was him. That was the guy in my dream, the old friend that my mother didn't have much contact  anymore but care a lot, also this guy knew my father as well.

Another info: we discovered that he was hospitalized because of a disease for months, so it makes sense that our encounter in my dream was in a hospital bedroom. He probably passed while I was dreaming about him.

My mom believed in me and she went to the funeral right after. She believes he wanted to connect with someone to guide him through the ""passing away"" process and he choose me (???) To connect him to my father that is already in the ""afterlife"" 

- END.

That's the dream I had and wanted to share with you, probably I will start to post any other significant dream in the future here. By the way my dream contains a little bit of clairevoyance, spirituality, psychic, etc so don't feel force to believe in these stuff because each person has their own beliefs, but that's what happened to me in 2020.

Sorry for the long text and I would love to read about your similar experiences with dreams that ended up happening days/weeks/months later in the real world.

310,Dreams,My dream in which I was in a zombie apocalypse then turned to me being in a fire team,"In my dream from what I can remember I believe it started around me inside a zombie hot spot which was in the woods that contained a lot of mutations. I was trying to escape a giant zombie by hiding under a dead, giant purple bug that seemed to meld with the vehicles as it then shifted to a parking lot or some other structure that served as a base of operations where we fight against zombies from outside the base.

The dream then changed completely to some sort of stage where I was in a fire team like in destiny 2 where Eris-Morn was not only 2 months pregnant but accused of crimes so they could get her body as an experimental weapon. Me and the others didn't want that to happen so instead, after trying to negotiate with the giant adversary who led the charges, we said that ""if they want a monster, we'll give them one"" as we ripped open reality while I punched the mirror and screamed in anger to summon the warp.",1674280279.0
311,Dreams,UPDATE: I prayed and my nightmare stopped,"I prayed in a nightmare and it stopped. I’m an atheist

I don’t really know if this is the right place to go but I didn’t want to go into a biased community of christians to get answers so here I am. I’m an atheist and I was having a pretty scary nightmare and for some reason I said “Please Jesus Christ let me stop having this dream,” and the dream almost immediately ceased and I woke up. Is this just a coincidence?


UPDATE: i had another nightmare and i inspired by a commenter, i said “barack obama please get me out of this nightmare” and i woke up. guess that proves that.",1674277775.0
312,Dreams,Don't you know it's leopard season?,"Last night I dreamt that I had gone into my backyard to hang out the washing, thinking to myself that i really needed to do some garden maintenance and trim back the long grass and overhanging foliage that had managed to get out of control. Dream me reasoned that another couple of days wouldn't hurt anyone and i'd get onto my house chores some other time.

At that moment, a genuine leopard literally strolled out of the bushes. We both stopped and looked at each other for maybe a minute or two, equally baffled. 

So i then naturally pick up a conveniently located folding chair and attempt to slam it with the chair to get the leopard to bugger off. I then turn back and run inside, dodging the sudden pool that had appeared in my backyard, but which fortunately was located in such a way that the leopard was blocked from following me into the house. (Dream leopard was somehow scared of water) 

Every so often, i would step out of the sliding back door to think of doing something and that damn leopard was there getting progressively more aggresive. It got to the point where a friend came over and wanted to use our pool, and i said something silly about not being able to go for a swim without a knife, and the friend looked at me with a WTF expression. I opened the blind and gestured to the insane leopard stalking my backyard. Then they said WTF out loud, and added, 'why haven't you cleared your grass out, don't you know it's leopard season?' like it was a commonly known fact and my leopard infestation was somehow my own fault.",1674274066.0
313,Dreams,multiple weird dreams nightly,i’ve started sleeping on my back recently because i got a sternum piercing and it’s led to me having the most weird and random (but also not so random) fucking dreams ever. i’ll have in depth dreams about a single thought i’ve had in a day and then wake up and go back to sleep and have a dream about another thought i’ve had. and one of them really freaked me out. my dream self was conscious that they were in a dream. it wasn’t a lucid dream or anything. i have all my dreams in third person as in i’m watching what’s happening through a different perspective not my own so i see myself and stuff. and my dream self said something to the other person in the dream along the lines of “this always happens: the story gets good and then i wake up before it gets better. i know this is a dream.” and i keep waking up genuinely believing some things in my dreams and i wake up thinking certain thoughts i’ve had i have had for a really long time but in reality it’s fake and i’ve never thought of it before. maybe this is normal dream behavior but i dream quite often but it’s never been so prevalent and weird as when i sleep on my back. does sleeping on my back make things weirder?,1674270543.0
314,Dreams,Living multiple parallel lives /false awakenings," So this is weird and I’m pretty sure it happens every night but I only notice it consciously some nights but it happens a lot. I’ll be living my “normal” life (usually pretty different from my “real” life but I’m always me. sometimes I’m super rich sometimes I’m different ages I have different friend groups and families, a lot of the times they’re alternate versions of my self at a different point of time in my life , but what happens is I wake up , realize I was dreaming  but I’m actually waking up into another dream in which im just getting up. Now this cycle may happen 5 times in a night that I remember but it might happen way more. I’m aware of false awakenings but those are different and I get those to, in those I wake up into a dream but I’m in my actual bed ,  pretty routine when that happens I stand up and either go to the washroom or go for the bedroom light and the light switch doesn't work. At this point I realize I’m dreaming and I can lucid dream for a couple minutes sometimes but there’s a difference in those I wake up into my real room and I  realize I’m dreaming and don’t get out of my room / bathroom in the “parallel lives “ I fully live , interact with people ,things  and everything seems real. I’m almost convinced I’m living a recursive stack of lives and being awake is less real than some of the times I’m “asleep” I know that sounds nuts but sometimes idk if I’m the man or the butterfly lol",1674270151.0

316,Dreams,Dream Dump,"Just wanted to share some of the dreams I have in my notes (that don't contain personal stuff). I don't dream often, but when I do, it's quite nice. It's worth mentioning that I've never had a lucid dream, so I don't really ""control"" my actions inside my dreams.  


2022 Dreams:

* I had two sets of eyebrows, and was contemplating shaving one set off. However, one set was too high and one set was too low. I woke up distressed.
* I was pushing a stroller on what looked like a fusion between The High Line and Brooklyn Bridge Park... but for some reason I ""knew"" it was Britian (I've never been there). There was a baby in the stroller, but I ""knew"" that it was my online friend, Kieran (???). The dream cut to black after a couple minutes, and the dream continues but with no visuals. I rolled Kamisato Ayaka (a character from Genshin Impact); I got excited and told my online friends about it. During this, I heard my mom talking to my aunt on the phone about how much of a dissapointment I am. And then... my mom shit her pants? It was a chaotic dream, with everything all over the place.

2021 Dreams:

* A kid got mauled by a monster with hanging hair/plants on its back. It looked like a crocodile, but with fleshy bits. The monster was killed (I don't remember who killed it), however, only the severed head of it remained. I hid the head in one of my kitchen drawers. The dream fell apart after that, but I do remember walking with Gorou (a character from Genshin Impact) to a donut shop. 
* I was in an industrial place that looked like the abandoned prison (forgot what it was named) I went on a school trip to in 7th grade. It was sunny, and there was concrete everywhere (brutalist architecture), with some parts being covered with overgrown plants. There were about 5 adult men kicking and throwing a ball... however, the ball wasn't really a ball. My brain couldn't process what it was, it was simply nothing. I had the urge to stop them from ""hurting"" it, so I ran up frantically and tried to catch it. When I caught it, I couldn't keep my eyes open and I was clenching my face and body as if I were in pain (I wasn't, though). Suddenly, I was somewhere else, though I still couldn't open my eyes. It felt warm, and I was in someone's lap. The prescence was mother-like, however It wasn't my mom. She told me that I was doing a good job, and that she was proud of me (something along those lines). I couldn't respond, but I thanked her in my head. It was... really touching. Then, there were a lot of whisper-screaming voices telling me to ""wake up"". I woke up in a cold sweat and very disoriented. Honestly, this is a dream that's stuck with me for so long.
* I was in a church, one I've been to before in a previous dream. The pews were populated by kids my age (around 15-16 at the time of this dream). Some were dressed in school uniforms, some in alternative style clothing, and some in regular street clothing. I associated this place with a classroom since there was a teacher standing at the front preaching something to us. Suddenly, one kid stands up and yells something before walking out. Everyone gets fed up and follows him out in protest (I assume the teacher said something bad, but I didn't know what he was saying). I followed him out as well, but not before crouching down to write ""I Am God"" in the aisle. I smugly walked out, weaving through the crowd of angry students. Then, when I walked through the door, I woke up.
* I was walking through a desert with soft, almost white sand. I don't remember who I was walking with, but I remember them being not human (but still humanoid, as in, they walk with 2 legs). There were about 4 or 5 of us. We arrived at an ocean, with shores made of rocks. The water was clear and calm, and we stopped to stare out in the distance. Suddenly, a monster that looked like Cthulhu came out of the water. The dream ended abruptly. I woke up upset, because I couldn't see the monster in its entirety.

2020 Dreams:

* I was standing in the kitchen with my dad and another guy that looked like my friends dad (hi Zach, if you're reading this lol). I was reaching for something inside the cabinet, however the cabinet door was blue and white. It was cold to the touch, and when I shook it, it sounded like ice cubes being shaked around. I asked my dad, ""Why does the cabinet door have ice in it?"", then I woke up. It was a short and somewhat realistic dream.

Analysis is welcome, if you'd like to pick apart my stupid dreams.",1674267723.0
317,Dreams,Kid always holding right hand,"So every night for the last two ish weeks my mom keeps dreaming about my autistic 5 year old. In the dreams he is always holding her right hand. He is able to talk more in the dreams. He’s always leading her to a
Space to meet with deceased relatives. They talk for a bit and then he brings her back to wherever the dream started. 

In the most recent dream they were at a beautiful pond. He pointed across the water and said “she’s here”. My mom said who’s here as she did not see anyone there.He replied “ she’s there. Don’t you see her?” And then she woke up.

318,Dreams,i felt like sharing the dreams i had last night,"they werent that long but theyre the first dreams ive remembered in the past two weeks. (also theyre rly stupid &amp; weird)

1st one, i remember coming to my parents in a dark, grey hotel lobby looking place with one room and barley any walls, since there were no walls there was a ""low poly"", ""video gamey"" looking forest with deep blue &amp; purple colors. it was also night i think. so i came up to them and their friends then toled them how im going on some kind of ""journey"" and that i need a vocaloid song to listen to as i walk. the parents sounded like they didnt rly care and didnt belive i was going to actually go on that journey. so i went over to a computer that was for some reason in a seating place in that lobby. so i sat on the chair and wrote down a bunch of lyrics then an anime looking image appheard on the screen, i added in Len's voice and came back over to my mother and toled her that i finished the song but idk how it sounds yet (i bet those vocaloid song artists wish this is how to make songs) she sortav got mad but i didnt care. i somehow teleported right outside the forest near a beach (like in georgian bay). and i was listening to that song as i walked and looked around, it seemed like i was there for the first time. then i woke up to negative energy in my room that scared me, eventually i fell back asleep 

2nd one

this one was a bit longer. it was night and i was in a place with giant trees that were golden, glowing, sparkling and had leaves made of honey, the trees were so thick that ppl had houses in them, i was inside mine which was pretty small and messy but i was doing something and suddenly, some person wearing white came up (he was hiding in my ""house) and stabbed me from behind with a white sword. i dont remember it hurting but i remember it felt tight. i respawned outside of my house and casually went back in it to continue what i was doing. later, another man wearing black and brown was also hiding in my house but not very well, i knew he was there and decided that ill just go outside untill he leaves. he did leave but then i decided to go to his house (he was my neibhour and his tree was alot bigger) and confront him abt the fact he tried to kill me. i entered his house and he was just standing there. his house was very big compared to mine. it was neat and had brown and black colors just like his clothes. the man also looked sad all the time, like sad clown makup kinda sad. i walked in, looked at him for a second and said: ""so i heard the you wanted to kill me, right?"" he didnt say anything but his expression was serious, the man just casually shook his head and closed his eyes in a weirdly calm way. then i said something like ""go ahead"" then we went outside for more space. his face looked sad again but he just held his sword and casually stabbed me (dont laugh at how stupid this is plz) it hurt alot, idk how to describe it but it was the most pain ive ever felt in a dream. then i ""respawnd"" in the same place as before. the rest of the dream was a bit messy and i dont remember much but i was in the same golden tree place as before but there was a small birch tree with bees around it, and for a while, me and this girl with brown hair and a purple hoodie were getting chased by bees. idk for how long but it took up atleast a third of the dream. at one part, i was at a dark, gloomy, foggy street (looks like mine but empty) but there was a whole crowd of ppl also chilling or walking. there was another part sortav like it but looked more lik a plaza i live near, not quite. me and some other person (that resembled one of the characters i make that had no eyes or nose, just a giant mouth, she was wearing a pink dress and was obviously blind) were walking down anothr gloomy street near a beach that looked almost exactly like the beach in collingwood (ontario) and i was running and bumped into a tall man and we started to talk, i remember i looked back and saw how she was struggling to follow me.

thats all i remember now

i doubt anyone read throught that whole thing but waddya think?? could the negative energy in my room effect the weirdness of that

319,Dreams,First time trying Galantamine,"Just had my first Galantamine experience the other day and it was insane. Didnt become lucid, but it was an intense experience. This is what i wrote after waking up in a panic.

“Im in bed trying to fall asleep for what seems like forever. I roll over and check my phone, its 1:18. I set it back down and just laid there staring at my ceiling thinking “man i need to get some sleep i have to go to work in a couple hours” Suddenly i start literally sinking into my mattress as if i was going through my bed, floor, etc. like the scene from Monkey Bone when he goes into the coma. I am hearing a loud rushing sound/ tone in my ears get louder and louder. Everything is quickly fading to a black/ Arctic blue and i cant move. I then manage to force myself to sit up. I then wake up, i am actually still laying down. I frantically check my phone and its actually 3:48 am and i had no idea i was actually dreaming. I then stayed up for an hour scared to go back to sleep.”

The dreams following that were fucking weird and vivid. Like working in just my underwear and barefoot, then getting yelled at for not having shoes on and then getting in a squirt gun fight. Long story short, Galantamine is powerful indeed.",1674265809.0

323,Dreams,I had a dream where I had to join a discord group chat. At first it took me a long time because for some reason I was typing on a keyboard very slowly. Then when I was done I went In an underground sand place.,"TLDR you don't have to read the whole thing.
 I just woke up from this dream so I kind of remember it. A bit of what happened at least.  The underground place was basically in the desert and door that had a skull on top of it. The skull kinda looked like a turtle skull. When the door opened,sand was going in the door. The underground kinda looked like the backrooms a little bit. Then after that I remember a I don't really know what it was supposed to be but it seemed to be a documentary on how making a human like golem made out of plastic clay skin,make the humans muscles out of hair since the hair is tensile so it would be good? Then you would make the bones out of osmium because then the golem would have really strong bones.  This whole thing is just a big mess. I remember  a voice telling me before that the FBI,was in fact, the fcking FBI in like a funny-ish,ironic sarcastic and condescending way. Basically I think the discord group chat thing was just a fleeting moment that flickered and disappeared. I remember being in the FBI sand place before the discord I think I don't really remember what came first. I'm not mentioning the whole dream because it was a bit too weird. It started with the streamer Tyler1 talking about his shoes (I don't really watch tyler1),then it went a little bit to Minecraft. Something happened in there and then it went to the FBI thing, briefly into joining the discord( the person of the guy telling me to join the group chat to help him with something was a combination of a guy I was friends with and a guy I didn't like. Since they kinda had the same voice,looked the same a bit although they were not the same age,their personality was a bit of the same. The older guy having the better personality than the younger guy. My point is,their voices and body went in together like a fusion and that fusion of 2 people was talking to me that they needed help with something. Then the fusion was roasting me on how it was taking me such a long time to get into the group chat. The roasting thing is familiar to me because I remember being with the older guy from the fusion on discord. We were talking about anime and manga stuff. Specifically we were talking about what the best kind of clone power is. Since I was too shy I didn't open my mic and I was typing in chat answering the question. I've met the two people from the fusion in real life and they both liked to roasting me. The younger guy was an obnoxious annoying idiot (I punched him in the face once)that was all bark and no bite basically. He's one of those people that act like they're cool and that they're from the hood or something to look cool and strong. A real moron that guy was. Sometimes he would have these fights when we're on the bus so I took that chance to punch him in the face. He got hurt and he said he was gonna fight me later. I actually wanted that fight to happen but then for some reason he stopped it. Anyway yeah so the older guy from the clone powers anime conversation was just being lighthearted it wasn't anything serious. I was basically taking a long time to type in manga that had a good and cool unique way to talk about clone powers called Akumetsu and since I was taking a long time to type and always writing paragraphs it was kinda funny. Anyway yeah so that explains the fusions of the 2 in 1. Yeah my dream went from Tyler1 talking about his shoes,A little bit of Minecraft,FBI underground sand place,brief discord group chat, back to the FBI sand place and then when inside the FBI sand place went into the this place that kind of look like the backrooms but wasn't and I think the end of the dream was documentary about the human-like Golem made of plastic clay skin, tensile hair and osmium bones. The voice that was talking to me about how the ""FBI was in fact,the FBI"" I think it was trying to explain to me why there was an underground sand place. In comedic sarcastic voice,the voice explained to me that it should be pretty obvious that FBI would have an underground sand place. Yeah that's the end of it. Again the whole thing is a mess. I kinda just woke up from it and started writing. Yesterday I had another dream but it was more of a nightmare than a dream. Basically,I think the reason why the unnerving disturbing dream happened was because I remember looking at a picture of this guy from an Ethiopian tribe that had a really big belly. Basically what happened in my gross dream,I'm not going to explain all of it, 2 things I took away from that disgusting experience was that 1,some of the people in my dream out of nowhere would just become fat. Not in an insane amount of just an uncomfortable amount to where it just feels painful to live. I was immune to this disease -ish thing. I call it a desease because the people that were completely fine started vomiting and were sick. When they exercised to try and to reduce the effects of the disease they had a lot of sweat on them. The fat wasn't really fat. It was more of like the people were swollen. Like when you get stung by a bee. Ok so the 2nd thing that happened from that nightmarish dream was that my brother had gotten this disease. When I first encountered him,I had the feeling to make fun of him for being fat.(he's not fat in real life it's just that he had the disease) I think before he was exercising and looked really sweaty. It did look like he was actually making progress on getting rid of the disease. Yeah so basically the moment that I really remember (I wanted to provide context towards the moment that I remembered so that's why it took so long to get there. I always feel the need to provide context and tell the whole story but it always takes a long time and I'm kind of bad at putting what happened into words.) was the part where my brother was vomiting but he was trying to hold the vomit in and not let to much out. I told him that it's better to let the vomit out and he let a lot out. It was gross. The vomit wasn't chunky it was very liquid-ish like he was spewing water out of his mouth. But yeah after that I woke up and that's basically the end of it. I wanted to write this because i wanted to put this on experience into good use. This was actually a short dream. Both of them were but it might seem long since I wrote this whole thing.",1674263515.0

My mom proceeded to tell me that he had been dug up for some reason, and they found a pulse, so he was brought to the hospital. I left to go to work, and while I was at work my mom called again. ""They've generated skin for your father. He's coming home!"" I was really happy about it, and wasn't scared by it. I remember saying, ""This feels like a dream.""

So she doesn't really count. Its just that she shows up more frequently  these days. Don't know why she'd pick me tbh. anyhow I don't count her  as new so here's the rest.

**My soulmate as a goddess**

I  was in a castle wandering around. Guards in odd clothing ran around in  panic. whatever was coming the grey walls would not be enough. Then I  calmly walked up some stairs into a throne room. On this throne room sat  my soulmate. I could feel it was her, without a doubt, only instead of a  Japanese girl this new form was that of a woman covered in red poppies,  greenery and other flowers with short white hair and golden eyes. In a  language I could somehow understand she told me a great evil was coming,  and our children would have to battle it. She basically directly told  me we had to consummate right here and now. My dream then cut to us  doing that with all the feelings with it. While taking breaks she'd  birth some one-eyed colourful eldritch abominations from her privates  and mouth which would fly out the window into the darkness outside. I  then woke up hard, So I went to go to the bathroom and after that had to  make a call for an appointment I missed, after which my soulmate who I  channel basically told me she sent the dream and that's her future life  with me just with fictional content added.

**Bast again**

I  dreamed about being in a house unlike here. It was a big flat with a  good shower but broken lights. I remember choosing this time to not go  with a cat after all the cat urine problems we've been living with in  this house. I sat in my lounge behind a tablet and looking outside the  window. I lived well because there's a tree covering up the window which  is rare in the Netherlands. Then I look down at the street and in front  of my building was Bast. just literally the cat goddess in a white  Egyptian dress with a lapis blue broad collar. She had a black furred  face and big golden green eyes that reminded me of my cat Dylan. She  wasn't holding anything at first but after seeing her I had to meet her,  so I went downstairs only to meet her in the hallway as if she  teleported there instantly. She was holding candies and a kitten which  she then let loose in the house. I ignored this event like I didn't read  the script and proceeded to make lunch in my new kitchen. Bast seems to  follow me around a bit, and then I woke up at 12pm. I know this sounds  dumb and ignoring my patroness is surely retarded. But I am not getting a  new cat after this. She'd have to beg me to get another one. Especially  after all the trouble our current ones are still causing. My soulmate  pretty much talked to me about this stuff and told me it wasn't  important. Bast seemed adamant though. I do love my cats but no, thank  you not again.

**Galactic entity**

After  this talk with her mostly talking I fell asleep again around 1am. I  have nothing to do this day, so I am sleeping in like I do everyday I'm  not working. This dream started with me in an airport. There was panic  and people were worried. Apparently a plane disappeared and though this  dream was choppy the flight hall showed only darkness. I somehow  choppily appeared in front of this darkness and walked into it without a  second guess. There I saw a galaxy spinning around slowly like a clock.  I wandered around a bit and everything seemed to be like a hologram. As  in I had ground to walk on and there was air, I clearly wasn't in  space, or it seemed very different from it. Then I see a star glowing.  This then moved and showed itself to be a light being, Who I again felt  was my soulmate. She reached out to me and before my dream self could  derpily reach out I found myself in a mall in Rijswijk the Netherlands. I  was confused as to why, but I felt I needed to buy a new phone and went  to Vodafone. before I could walk the RIGHT way I woke up. at 15:00 and  then I got up to eat, and my soulmate explained some more stuff, and  then we decided to lie again after some doom browsing on the phone.

**Succubus dream**

She  came to fuck, I barely remember it, unlike the other dream I wasn't  aroused one bit. woke up at 16:45 when my mom said she wanted to order  Indonesian food. My soulmate hates the succubus. The end.

328,Dreams,"Last night's dream of an accident in New York during Chinese New Year celebration. Subway escalator brake failed and caused mass carnage and death. Police psychologist unit had to respond, people traumatized.","Had this vision dream last night. Very detailed. I actually live in Europe, have no connection to US. My brother lives in Philadelphia, the dream featured him as a witness, his Asian friend was one of the casualties in the accident.

Dream was definitely located in New York, I've visited before, I recognized the energy. Could see the water too, seemed close to Coney Island. I also saw map of US/Canada, was looking at New York state from this top-angle map view.  

Dream started with subway being closed, malfunction, everyone was told not to waste time going down there, stay above-ground.   
The replacement for the subway was above-ground. In my dream, it appeared as a purple rollercoaster, it even had an upside-down loop.  

 I couldn't understand why they expected people to be amused to commute, sending a rollercoaster instead of buses (turns out... Chinese New Year is this weekend, so that would explain it... people going downtown for party to celebrate, not commuting from work... they went there to be amused).  

So I saw my brother's Asian friend, he went down what I first thought was a theme-ride of some sort (but in retrospect, it looked like an escalator going underground). Where he first hung up his leather briefcase, and sent it down. Then he hung himself up somehow, and followed.   

But then I saw a long wide black rubber strap snap. It seemed to stretch really far out. When it snapped, I looked at my brother and said ""oh oh, that's not good."" Immediately the people on the ride all collapsed down the escalator.  

This leather strap was somehow like a brake or something, it was holding the contraption at a steady slow pace. When it snapped, the brake was fully released. 

Next thing I know, everyone is dazed and confused. No one knows what happened, isn't aware that this Asian friend's head was completely squished.  

Police officer is on scene, big guy with a gut. He blocked off the carnage with some sort of barriers, and was saying ""the carnage is so bad, people are traumatized, they don't even know what they're looking at right now. They can't process it yet. Send the psych unit.""  

I looked down at my white Puma shoe, and noticed the bottom was covered in bright red blood. I left footprints of blood walking away from the incident without even noticing I had stepped in blood.  

The other people were so traumatized, they didn't even realize it was blood, they thought it was escalator fluid/oil that was released.  

But this Asian friend, it was clear that his head was completely squished, no longer recogniazeable.  

My theory is this happened at a poorly maintained escalator at a subway station. During the Chinese New Years event, the subway was packed. When the people were told the subway is down, they all went to exit at the same time. This caused an escalator to be packed with people, and this escalator was not maintained on schedule. Being packed caused some sort of rubber strap to snap, which rendered the brakes on the escalator inoperable.  

The escalator was full of people going up. When the brake snapped, the stairs quickly reversed and went downwards, accelerating because of the weight of all the people on the steps.  

As it accelerated, people were thrown backwards at high velocity. People began piling up at the bottom. As the stairs pulled under the floor, people got sucked in, body parts cut off.  

By the time the incident ended, there was a huge pile of people and body parts at the bottom. People crawling on top of each other. Covered in blood. Screaming and dead bodies.  

Later, I saw they brought in a white crane to get to my brother's dead Asian friend. The crane operator must have been called in on a day-off unexpectedly, because he was stumbling, had a difficult time getting into the cabin. He slipped and fell multiple times (I think he was drunk, maybe he was celebrating this holiday too and had been drinking).  

 
When he finally got into the crane, he swung the boom line eratically everywhere. We had to yell at him to becareful, and jump to not get hit.  

The crane was somehow required to extract the bodies. They didn't have time to wait, so I'm assuming some people who were still alive got sucked into the machine compartment.

---  

There was more details to the dream, personal. I told my brother the moment I woke up. He confirmed some details that make me suspect this could be a premonition / warning.

Anyways, if you're going to be celebrating Chinese New Years in New York this weekend, stay away from the subway escalators.",1674261445.0
329,Dreams,I dreamed of being told to open my eyes.,"What could it possibly mean? Like in video games or movies, I was dreaming of myself closing my eyes in this spacious room with bed, chairs, television and wide windows. 

I was with two people, from what I remembered it was a woman and a child. It seems that they were giving me a tour of the house and when they knew that I planned to read ebooks before going to sleep at night they told me not too. 

They began to explain why, that different entities are showing up if I plan to read through phone at night. It would be better if its a physical book. 

Then this weird character of me in that dream did something. I closed my eyes and try to sleep brushing off their advice, and when I did, I was murmuring some words. Like when they asked me to open my eyes, I told them that I can’t and I was seeing a door in my dream. 

While still in dream state, they keep yelling at me to leave and that I should open my eyes. It feels like they are forcing me to open it. It’s blurry at first and when I did what they instructed, I really did wake up in reality. 

So yeah, I was kind of concern to what my dream represents about. I felt like it brought me a message that couldn’t be ignored, so I searched up in google to find some answers but didn’t get it. What do you think could it be?",1674259586.0

332,Dreams,Really long and really weird/absurd dream.,"Tl;dr:a grizzly bear getting shot leads to a chain of events eventually causing a cartoon crocodile to cause political controversy,the death of a dark web drug smuggler and arms dealer becoming a meme,the creation of a boomer 4chan conspiracy theorist cult,internet trolls raiding a military base in search of dinosaurs,a bacterial infection causing shampoo shortages,and a digital animation of a honey badger being used to scam people online.

Butterfly effect


It started off with a grizzly bear at a zoo named Orbus. A kid who came to the zoo with his mom accidentally jumped into the grizzly bear enclosure where Orbus lived,and when Orbus started approaching him,the zookeepers panicked and shot the bear,killing him instantly. This immediately caused outrage online,leading to internet memers and trolls creating a sort of posthumous fanbase for Orbus the grizzly bear and turning him into a meme via a series of ironic tribute videos and memes etc. They also often mocked the kid's negligent mother and claimed that 'Orbus was taking care of the kid better than his mom was' and that 'they should've shot the damn mother instead'. They also often made references to a 'meme war' and often made images of a grandpa talking to his grandkids which consisted of the caption 'grandpa,what happened when you fought in the great meme war?' 'You see,kid,it all started when they shot that damn grizzly bear...'

After the death of Orbus becoming a huge meme,a famous drawing of a  cartoon crocodile named 'Zozo the Croc',which in the dream reality had supposedly been a popular meme for a very long time,became politically controversial when a Trump supporter posted a version of Zozo the Croc with a MAGA hat photoshopped on his head and the caption '#MAGAforever'. This caused leftists to call the cartoon crocodile a 'far-right hate symbol',with rightists,by contrast,embracing its use and frequently using politically-themed versions of Zozo the Croc to troll leftists online.

A few years later,a millionaire financier named 'Jeremy Morstein' (or something along those lines idk thats how i remembered it) who was friends with several famous politicians had been arrested after the FBI found out he secretly ran a weapons and drug trafficking/smuggling ring via the dark web,and while awaiting trial,died mysteriously in his jail cell. The media reported it as a suicide,but both sides of the political spectrum thought it was likely a murder and started mocking the mainstream media as well as frequently accusing each other's political leaders of being involved in the ring run by Morstein.

I eventually saw a group of boomers turn on their laptops and enter 4chan,where they all came across a series of anonymous posts on some boards related to conspiracy theories created by a user known simply as 'Z'. Z claimed that an Illuminati-run international drug trafficking ring was planning to take over every major political institution on Earth and assassinate Donald Trump,while Trump was supposedly planning to catch and remove every member of the smuggling ring before they could assassinate him. At one point,Morstein was also mentioned in relation to this. The boomers all started worshipping this Z guy like a cult and started promoting his content online.

Later on,the same trolls online who worshipped Orbus the grizzly bear and used Zozo the Croc to troll their political opposition found out about a super secretive U.S. military base known as Region 76,and started spreading conspiracy theories about how dinosaurs weren't fully extinct and that the government is hiding living dinosaurs in Region 76 and that that is why they are hiding it. Around 20 million facebook users joined a group called 'Raid Region 76' in support of raiding the place,but only around 5000 people actually showed up on the scheduled date. They never successfully entered,and were mostly just edgy internet trolls who dressed up in wacky costumes while yelling curse words at guards and throwing rocks at them while screaming 'THIS IS FOR ORBUS!'.

A few months after the failed Region 76 mass raid,a mysterious parasitic bacteria species known simply as 'GLABAC' was discovered in China,supposedly from consuming weasel/stoat meat. Overtime,the disease-spreading bacteria infected over 5% of the global population,causing a mass epidemic which,in its early stage,indirectly somehow caused a global shampoo shortage in supermarkets worldwide.

Overtime the shampoo shortage ended but the bacteria stayed controversial and a polarizing topic. 

During the duration of the bacterial epidemic,some people eventually came up with an idea similar to the old Zozo the Croc meme,where people saved and collected images of 'rare Zozos' which were edited versions of the image. In this case,however,it was an online financial scam:it was referred to as a SCI (Selective Collectible Image),and the most famous one was a drawing of an anthropomorphic cartoon honey badger with a confused/shocked facial expression known simply as 'Confused Badger'. You could edit the image as you wanted,and if you created a new version of the Confused Badger SCI,you could sell it online and scam rich people,as well as having the right to sue anyone else who downloads or screenshots your SCIs without permission/for free and accuse them of property theft. The SCIs quickly became a meme and were frequently mocked online due to their scammy nature.

338,Dreams,I dreamed I defeated my sleep paralysis demon,"So I suffer from sleep paralysis somewhat often and it has gotten to the point where I’m aware that what I see is not an actual demon and sometimes I fight back. I managed to get a kick out and “kick the demon” per se, and then I wake up knowing what just happened. 

The thing is , yesterday It happened like it usually does but now I managed to land the kick on the sleep paralysis demon and I’m not sure exactly how but I knew that I had won the fight. Next thing I know I appear in a court of law as if facing trial because I defended myself. Turns out that the court and judge are baffled as to how I managed to fight off the demon. I explain myself and then they ask me how I’m certain I defeated it.

Next thing I remember the “demon” reanimates itself, goes straight to a barrier and starts to suck the light off of that world… wherever it was. 

I have had sleep paralysis for a long time but never have I ever “defeated” the demon.  

I just wanted to share and see if anyone else has managed to “win”?  

I always thought of sleep paralysis as a way of my body telling me that it’s getting to hot (I always sleep covered with something) and I’m about to suffocate, but I don’t know. Can you actually kick the demon’s ass??

339,Dreams,Dream about a frog/fly/lizard creature bringing me comfort,"I don't remember much, but the gist of the dream is that there was a fly that had the face of a frog and the lower body of a lizard (it was toddler sized) and it would be sitting behind an office desk and it would just watch me. Oddly enough, it's presence kept making me feel super calm and comforted. 

I would be in the room with it for a few minutes and then the scene would change and I would be in a children's park at night playing with my friends from middle school. And then at one point, there was an older guy that tried to bully my classmate so my friends and I jumped him, but because he was older he was stronger. He targeted me because I was the one who rallied everyone together to attack him. I ran away and I came across a small house and walked in. 

As soon as I opened the door, the fly creature was sitting behind the desk in front of me again. I ended up picking it up (it became sized like a regular lizard) and I flipped it on its back and started caressing its tail and belly. It was a very soothing, almost hypnotic type of movement. I only had a limited amount of time with the lizard so I had to stop eventually. 

After I stopped, the scene changed and I was standing on a rock in the middle of the ocean. Millions of fish would swarm towards me, and I had to pick out a select few to keep. It was the same thing I er and over again: I would be sitting on the rock, waves would crash over me and in those waves would be a school of fish and I needed to grab specific ones. It was very isolating and depressing.  It was implied that I was stuck here forever and that I would never see the fly creature again, and that's how the dream ended.",1674253706.0

342,Dreams,"Strange Dream Experience - Past Life, Alternate Reality, Paranormal??","When I was 16yo, I had a very strange and meaningful dream. I recently talked with a friend about it, and they suggested I seek some advice or help. To be honest I'm not sure if this post belongs here, or maybe on r/psychic or something instead? Figured I'd start here.

I dreamed a full and complete life, getting married, growing old, traveling the world, and so on, until I died in my sleep at 86yo. Then I woke up as myself at 16yo. It was very jarring, and took me months to sort through what happened to me. I do not want or desire to ""interpret"" what this dream meant, but rather to understand if this kind of experience is common, or whether it relates to some other field (past life, mirror dimensions, etc.). I don't have much understanding or experience with those things, so I can't determine where to go from here. To be perfectly honest, I'm not even sure what questions to ask.

This dream still influences my other dreams; I've dreamed of the house I shared with my husband many times since then, perhaps once or twice per year, for 20y. It is often ""dressed as"" something else: a field hospital, an orphanage, a boarding school, and so on. But it is definitely my house, the floor plan is the same each time, and it feels familiar and comforting. When I lucid dream, I sometimes try to make my house appear, and it would only work rarely. Once, I felt like my house got upset with me for trying, and I came to understand that I should not seek out the house, that it would present itself to me when I needed it most.

I taught myself to lucid dream, and had a handful of prophetic dreams before I turned 10yo. My mother dreams as vividly as I do, so I always thought these experiences were normal/common. Now that I have my own daughter, she has begun telling me of her vivid and detailed dreams as well. The very basic reading I've done suggests this type of dreaming is *not* common, and indeed, my friend was marveled that I'd had such experiences.

Does anyone here have any similar experiences? Or know of someone I could contact to discuss further? Thank you!",1674251457.0

347,Dreams,Disturbing dream TW for violence against animals,"If anyone could tell me their thoughts on the fucked up dream I've just had, that would be fantastic. 

Just a little bit of backstory, this isn't the first disturbing dream I've had. I get them every once in a while, and they are so horrible that I usually wake up with my heart pounding out of my chest, sweating and screaming or otherwise making distressed noises.


In this instance I was in some sort of massive strip mall, and the elevators were flat strips that moved really fast and you could get to places so quickly you would almost fall over while you were on them. There was a lot more to the dream than the disturbing part but it went like this: 

I had gone the backway into some kind of giant playground area (like the kind with the ball pits and massive slides) and there was some deranged fuckhead that I'd encountered previously, and for whatever reason, I'd decided to come back. I had a cat in my arms. A white and brown cat. I was carrying her in my arms and I could hear this creep moving around above me and then I heard footsteps coming down thr stairs.


I ran down the hall to try and make a get away attempt and I noticed this small exit with a metal gate in front of it. Miraculously, it opened out into the outside and I turned around, holding the cat in my arms and trying to stay calm.

Then I look back at the gate, and there's another cat. It's a darker brown/blackish cat, and it's scrabbling desperately against the gate. I don't open the gate because I think to myself, ""Oh, what's he gonna do to a cat? He's after me, he'll leave an innocent cat alone.

I couldn't have been more wrong. The guy finally reaches us. I never see his face, only his arms and hands. I only heard him say one thing. 
""Fine, if you don't come out, I guess I'll just do this then.""
He moved so fast I didn't have a chance to think.
He grabs the cats head from behind, reaches inside its mouth, and stretches its jaw back. I can see the cat basically screaming, all of its teeth, and the wet pink insides of its mouth, and then, in a split second, he'd snapped the cats fucking face in half.

I heard its bones snap, and then I woke up sweating, and my heart pounding.

349,Dreams,Eric Clapton Lip Synced My Dream,"Like most days during the last decade, while it's dark with the early birds, a mouse move wakes my PC in the lounge, and without opening my eyes, a CtrlF12 started My DJ Reader. Slowly, I drifted back to sleep, dreaming interpretations to the text and music. After an hour, I was somewhere north of Peru, with Eric Clapton singing, ""River of Tears"". I was watching a monitor with a group of people in a hall, and the full face of a youth was slowly singing the Pilgrim track. With a closer look, I discussed how the voice over got better and better. About six minutes into the song I woke up, and heard it come to an end. I realized the dream was constructed to lip sync perfectly. This was a first for me, like wow!",1674247314.0

Today, I saw a person in a karate class I take every week and as I glanced at them I had the immediate thought of ""wait, that's them"". They looked exactly the same as in my dream, every single detail identical.

352,Dreams,Found my dog who has been missing for 7 months,"My dog went missing June 1st while I was out of town and my fiance was watching him and my other dog. From the moment he went missing, I had a horrible gut feeling we would never find him. This was mostly because he went missing from my fiancé's friend's house. My fiance went over there for a grill out like we did every month at their house; our dogs loved playing in their fenced in yard that's 5 acres. Well after 4 years it was discovered that our dog can jump a fence. I came back in town that night to help look for him. We did everything to find him (miles of foot searches in the summer heat, flyers to all the neighbors and businesses, search by drone, lake search via boat, slept outside in the area where he went missing, put tons of clothes outside the house he went missing, notified all the local farmers in case he went after their chickens to make sure they wouldn't shoot him, advertised a reward for him after a few weeks in case someone had found him and was planning to keep him... the list goes on). 

I had two dreams where I would find him but never actually get to where I could touch him. Someone would come along and try to help me catch him and that would scare him off. I would then wake up. 

Last night I had the most vivid dream that I found my dog. He was sleeping in tall grass across from the apartment we lived in when he went missing (we only moved 2 months ago). That area where he was sleeping doesn't actually exist in real life. I spotted him and jumped out of my car. My dog sprinted to me, and I grabbed his collar to make sure he couldn't wander back off. I was so scared he would run away that I carried him back to our old apartment (he was almost 60 pounds). In my dream I posted on all the Facebook pages I had been posting about him in to let everyone know he was found. I called all my friends and family, heck I even messaged my coworkers. I was so happy to finally have my baby back! Then I woke up, and I realized that it was just a dream. I'll likely never see my dog ever again. I feel like I absolutely failed him, and there's nothing I could have actually done to prevent this except not go out of town that day.",1674245031.0
353,Dreams,Dream #1: The Tower Riddle," **Scene 1:**

I'm on the street, taking a test. The topic is literature, and the professor is an older woman in her 60s, white and blond curly hair, stern and strict face. This test I am taking right on the street, not in a classroom.

It starts raining. I look for a place to not get wet, which I find under a parasol, which on the street in front of a fast food place. There is someone else there, taking refuge from the rain, it is a woman of my age and looks from Asian origin. I try to speak to her, to have a conversation, but she mostly ignores me. Then I go back to my test, and I realize I will not be able to finish in time, too many questions, too little time. Yet I think, for some reason, that I have time for a walk, to help my clear my head. In one level, I was just taking a walk and planning to come back, but on another I knew as I walked more and more, and was now on a deserted street, that I wasn't planning to go back at all I only told that to myself so I would have the initiative to go away.

**Scene 2:**

Memories of this part are mostly gone.

I'm in an alley, it's afternoon, there is some luxury to this place. This space only works as to communicate two other spaces, it's function is to move food from the first place to the other. First, I am there alone. Later, a man appears, in his 30s or 40s, and tells me he is going into the cold room. I follow him.

**Scene 3:**

I follow the man into the cold room, it turns out to be a whole and huge building, and hard to navigate. After this we're a group, all men, moving through this building used to store items cold. After much walking, we reach a small space we need to go through, this small space is similar to the final squeeze in Sand Cave, just before the space where Floyd Collins was trapped. There is an open and luminous space on the other side, but I have serious doubts of going through it.

**Scene 4:**

Somehow, I am on the other side. It's afternoon, it looks like Traverse Town from Kingdom Hearts. I have to wait for someone, I have been told I need to wait for that person that will come from some place far away to give me or tell me something.

That person comes, but I have not image of that person, it's a shadowy figure. I talk to him and he tells me where I have to go. I follow his directions and find an old car. My mother appears, and we both get into the car. She cannot drive in real life, and the car in the dream has no brakes. I suggest to her she should not drive, or to do it very slowly. Soon we're travelling fast as shit through streets and avenues, like teenager playing GTA. I think I'm going to die, but I take it very stoically.

She leaves the street and starts drive on the sideway (I might have told her to do that, because it was emptier). We hit something and we both go flying out of the front window.

**Scene 5:**

I stand up and there are two other men with me, about my age. Our bicycle hit something and broke. I offer to pay for part the damages, he tells me the repairs will cost 60 dollars, I give him 5, and the other guy gives him nothing. He takes the 5 without telling me anything.

We walk. Again, it's a luxurious and refined avenue, something like Beverly Hill. As we walk, each of the other two point to their buildings, where they live. I stay silent, I couldn't afford to live in a place like that.

We reach a tower and go inside. There is a spiral staircase on the inside walls, and we go up, I go the last. We need to reach a door at the top. The other two reach the door and leave, but when I am at the top the stairs disappear I am left holding from an iron bar stuck to the wall. ""The tower"" gives me a riddle, that I need to solve to be able to leave. My answer to the riddle will reveal something profound about me, but I realize that whatever answer I give, right or wrong, what will be revealed either way is something dark, and this means I have no way to win.

**Scene 6:**

I am again on the avenue from before, but walking the other way. I am with one of the two that was with me before, and he tells me he needs to go to his house to get something, so with him I go.

We're inside his apartment. We both sit in a dark room, very poorly build, I look at a wall and it's dark blue and rotten, with bubbles of air below the painting. I look at another of the rooms in the same apartment, the one that has a window facing the street, that one looks very elegant, luxury again, expensive furniture. The contrast between the two room surprises me.",1674244186.0

356,Dreams,Hurricane Apocalypse - Dreams come in sets of three,"Hello. This is something different for me as I've never really thought to ask before about my dreams or nightmares. I've always thought that my dreams are quite vivid, I can remember quite a bit of details but most of my dreams are unremarkable, but this one in particular is one that has always stuck with me. Engrained in the back of my mind to which it occasionally rears its ugly head to frighten me.

This is a nightmare that I've had since a child. It always begins with a normal scene like a supermarket, a swimming pool or a busy neighbourhood. I am not present in the dream, it often feels like my perspective is from a security camera as my view pans from left to right, but there are people present as they go about their days. A short time would pass uneventfully before suddenly without warning everything becomes chaotic. Trees are blown off their roots. Windows smash. The screen shakes.  There's a loud distorted wind-like noise and then... silence.

When everything stops the world is left abandoned, there's no people, the buildings become decayed, the sky turns an orange/red hue and some form of ominous ambient track plays. Some time would then pass, with the camera/my eyes panning from left to right throughout the empty world and then darkness. Everything turns black. Some time passes and then another different location appears and the same thing would happen. This happens a grand total of three times, repeating in the exact same manner before cutting to black and at that point I would wake up rattled and panicked. I'd struggle to get back to sleep after that.

The most vivid example I can recount is a scene of a swimming pool. People are jumping off diving boards, playing in the pool as through the large glass windows you can see a street with a row of houses. Cars drive down this street and people walk by. What I can liken to the apocalypse then occurs and everyone disappears, they are not physically blown away by the winds or are abducted by aliens, they just disappear. Then the exact same swimming pool is shown, the pool completely drained and coated in grime. The windows are completely smashed and shards of glass litter the floor. The houses across from the pool are damaged and are beginning to crumble. The only light in the pool is from an emergency exit light faintly glowing green and the sickly orange sky outside. An ominous piece of music plays but there is no direct threat or suggestion of one. Things suddenly cut to black and the dream repeats at another location.

Now I must have been around 6 or 7 when these dreams first started and I believe they would reoccur every so often although I'm unsure of the exact frequency. Yet there was a time where I stopped having these dreams and I'd forgotten about them. They suddenly returned when I was around 14 and I would have these dreams several times over the course of a three month period before they stopped again. I'm in my 20's now and I haven't had these dreams since but I can still distinctively remember them.

I believe that this dream is inspired by several things I remember as a child which I'll list below:

* [Ecco the Dolphin's Abduction Scene](https://youtu.be/xZ_NdeeJAhE?t=41)
   * This in particular is the most direct comparison I can think of. Especially with the loud noises and the haunting track that plays after the dolphin's disappear. I played this game as a young child and it scared the ever loving shit out of me.
* [Cartoon Network City](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=pbbYs-Ki1x8)
   * When I think about the dreams, the locations and the way they look it reminds me a lot of the CN City bumpers that they used to show in the early 2000s. I used to watch these as a kid and I always felt a bit unnerved by them. It always felt strange seeing cartoon characters in a hyper realistic world. The laundromat in particular is a location that looks identical to how I remember it from my dreams.
* [Are You Afraid of the Dark's Intro](https://youtu.be/6b2G8ySKNgA)
   * There was a lot of episodes of this show that stuck with me but the intro in particular is something that has always freaked me out. I was way too young to be watching this when I saw it. The scenes at the start with the boat and the empty swingsets always used to freak me out. The swings in particular are actually a really great example of what I remember the world looking like at the end of my dreams minus the blue hue and ghostly laughter. 
* Game Soundtracks
   * Video game music has always played a big aspect in my life and it feels as if the music that would play during the apocalypse sections. Stuff like [Self Esteem Fund](https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=t9nocjg2OLI) from the Portal soundtrack as well as [this](https://youtu.be/h_FKJxy7oeE) from a Professor Layton game weirdly enough give a similar vibe to what I remember although both these games were unreleased at the time these dreams first manifest so it's unlikely they have anything directly to do with it.

Thanks for taking a read of this, let me know if you have any questions or have experience something similar. Would be nice to know I'm not the only person who's been plagued by this weird nightmare. Cheers!",1674242268.0
357,Dreams,Can anybody explain my dream??? I just woke up and this is to the best of my memory. Please,"I saw dray and Keith (my roomates/best friends) and I asked them basically if they were dreaming too and they said “we are all always dreaming. Just ask us later” it was very odd. Anyways that was during a party that was in my friend (friend who I still am friends and still love him like a brother with but he had a pretty hard falling out with our whole friend group) Kayden’s basement then I saw this girl who I typically wouldn’t find attractive walk in the party and I walked up to her and said hi and she kinda waved me off then I tried to ask her what her name was and her friends were like pulling me away freaking out at me acting like I was doing something bad then I left the party and out of nowhere I switched to where I was in a car and driving and I had my selfie camera open on Snapchat and I took a peek at myself and looked normal, but then I remembered I had seen somehwere to never stare at yourself in a reflection/mirror/etc. in a dream so of course I had to. Then I stared at myself and my face was all distorted like really really distorted (not terrifying by any means but extremely uneasing) and my eyes were pitch black and all though my face was so distorted it looked really sad/depressed then I completely lost control of the dream and my voice got extremely deep and like slow motion almost and my car started swerving and all the cars around me were exploding and then I forced myself to wake up cause why would I not at that point I was starting to panic ya know.

358,Dreams,My first extremely VIVID dream (about murder :/ ),"**CONTEXT:** I've never had a fully lucid dream before and this wasn't either but this was really interesting. I recently read Dreams of Awakening by Charlie Morley and learned about lucid dreams where you could 'ask' your subconscious something you are concerned/interested about. To me, this was such a cool concept and I've tried to achieve it to no avail. This dream was interesting in particular because I remembered almost the entire thing plus it felt extremely real and I think towards the end I had a similar interaction in a very abstract way. Also, I've received a call to arms recently and have had pretty reserved emotions about it, and several arguments with friends, which likely fuelled this dream

For the sake of anonymity, my friend who was in the dream shall be called Joe. Excuse the bad grammar I wrote this into my journal at 5 AM and was trying to get back to sleep.

**The Dream:**

I had this very intense dream about murder. In this dream, I am in a car with Joe and I don’t know where we are going and he will not tell me. Then we arrive in a Ukrainian apartment in the middle of a war zone. Everything felt extremely real I could hear cycles of artillery coming around every few minutes and everyone there went silent during these rounds as to pray and get into cover under some furniture. Outside the window, you could see Ukrainian soldiers taking defensive positions within the wreckage. One of the artillery shells landed on this building and you could hear and feel the trembling. It didn’t do much but had a massive effect on everyone’s mental state. I think we were here because Joe wanted to volunteer to help the refugees or fight. Eventually, we left and got on a ferry. Again I didn’t know where we were going. This ferry was filled with people partying and having the time of their lives but I couldn’t figure out what was happening so I went along with it. We were on this ferry for like 2 or 3 days. Eventually, we got off and I went back in the car, the same situation. We drove through fields and rural cities and then eventually I met my parents, and I knew we were in Lithuania. They were outside some building and were waiting for me, I was of course, ecstatic to see them. Then we went inside this building and I could immediately tell it was a recruitment centre and the same people from the ferry were enlisting. There was a social there too with people drinking and meeting each other before heading off to a training centre or whatever. Naturally, I knew what was going on and I was not going to go. I also remember writing about this in Thought chat(Instagram group chat) specifically. The entire evening that day was people convincing me that I should go and it would be heroic and this just fuelled a lot of negative and destructive emotions inside of me. There was obviously a lot of pressure on me from a lot of parties including my parents, Joe and even a few strangers. I ignore all of these for the sake of not going around in circles with everyone. Eventually, this moment passes and we are at the social and I'm feeling unusually agitated like I've never been. I remember being with Joe and he was meeting as usual with the new recruits about Tushonke (tinned stewed pork) which I had in my hands, probably from a surrounding shop. It was the same can I had before which was the size of my hand and weighed 350-500g or something. Then I think one of the recruits was like  (along the lines of )“ maybe you should stop eating it and start fighting that would do a whole lot of good”. For context, I think there was a war currently with Russia and Lithuania, but it was quite stable due to Nato. Anyways, after this, I couldn’t take any more. I got pissed off grabbed the can and smashed her face with the can over and over again just not stopping without a thought in my head. Everyone around me is just in absolute shock, pale and unable to move. I don’t remember much about the immediate aftermath but I remember feeling very guilty and felt like I was a disappointment beyond saving and didn’t even feel like a human with a purpose anymore, obviously my parents did not want any association with it and we had a brief exchange before never seeing them again, along the lines of me being a disappointment.I was ready to take on the consequences afterwards.I also remember texting Thought chat again about what happened very briefly and how I will never see them again. I remember Joe #2 responding with “Murder = bad but Murder for your king = good”.Eventually, I'm outside in the rain with everyone leaving the party (though not running), and one officer comes up and I stood there with hands in front ready to get cuffed. I get cuffed and go into the car. He let me get into the passenger seat, so I start getting to know him and having a conversation with him. He knows I’m a first-time offender so he explains how for now he will put me in a holding cell and how the procedure goes. I ask about what prison is like to which he does not answer at all. I also asked him what the difference between murder and killing in a war is and he replied “ murder is like the horror genre”. I think he drove in a few loops because the prison was actually nearby but he was a good character who let me speak my mind fully. In my mind, all I could think about was how I will have to pay my dues and nothing after that. We arrived at the prison, not the holding jail cell. This might have been due to a verdict being decided by the time we were driving ( due to tens of witnesses). Naturally, no one was there to say goodbye. Then I remember getting my jumpsuit and going in to get a haircut. This is where the dream starts to lose its realism and marks the end. I turned into brad pit from inglorious basterds and while shaving this guy comes up from behind in a rapey prison way and then I see Kevin hart cowering too, so by that point, I realise this isn’t real and wake up (05;21, no prep before bed, just alcohol)

360,Dreams,"i had a dream that my sister died, it made me feel horrible","i really needed to get this off of my chest because i don’t want to tell her and freak her out but this was one of the worst dreams i’ve had in awhile. 

the dream starts off where i was on a small plane with my mom and my younger sister. somehow it ends up crashing into a house, me and my mom survive but my sister does not. the dream after that point became so focused on her death. i had to email my teachers i had from when i was in high school that i wasn’t going to be able to be at school for a few days, i had to try and make our pets understand she wasn’t coming back, i had to tell her friends through her phone that she had passed, i had to go through her stuff and pick out clothes and what she wanted to be buried with etc etc. it didn’t seem like a dream at all, it all felt so real. me and my sister aren’t the kind to say stuff like “i love you” or anything out loud but we are very very close. i didn’t even want to live anymore, i felt as if half of me was ripped away and my life felt incomplete. in my dream i was trying to convince myself to stay alive for my mom and my brother but i felt so lost. i was trying to get her to give me some sort of sign or something because i was just desperate to hear from her again. when it was time for her funeral i had to give her eulogy and i broke down. i don’t even remember exactly what was happening at this point but i just remember sobbing and feeling just heartbroken. i don’t think i’ve ever had such intense feelings like that from a dream before. randomly spaghetti started flying into the church (yeah idk either lol) and it took that for me to realize i was dreaming and it woke me up. the first thing i saw was my sister going through some of her makeup lol, i was relieved to say the least. anyways, thank you for reading",1674240207.0

362,Dreams,Metaphorical Dreams and Religion,"I am non-religious but of Protestant background, I went to church when I was younger and stopped when we moved away. Recently I have been having these strangely metaphorical dreams and I am unsure of what to make of them. I get that your subconscious 'reveals' things to you but this felt out of my within my control and thought process. Is there a deeper meaning to these dreams?

Dream 1 : This was probably the most realistic dream I've ever had, it was if I could physically feel and touch everything around me. I was arguing with my brother on the stairwell, unsure what about, and I push him to the side. He falls through a door to the right (not actually there irl) and inside is an empty black void. He's clinging on the ledge of the floor. I'm panicking trying to help him up but nothing is working. He falls into the abyss below, before I have time to react see a tall dark figure out the corner of my eye with coarse fluid-like skin. It starts chasing after me through the rooms, I'm going down the stairwell and it's monkey-barring across the place. A couple minutes later I wake up in a cold sweat. Initially I thought nothing of it but these themes keep appearing across all my dreams. 

Dream 2 : I'm in a skyscraper, everything looks hyper-clean and professional. I'm heading towards a lift and see a faceless man in a cliché red and gold hotel staff suit like in the cinemas. He says that in order to move up, I need to deposit a coin in the box. Despite the luxury I feel sad for whatever reason. I wait a few minutes in awkward silence and reach the top-floor. The doors open and an expansive grey fog appears. There is a figure in the distance standing in the centre. I wake up pretty much the second it opens.

Dream 3 : This is the one that creeped me out the most, a dream within a dream. Downstairs we have this yellow-hued digital clock. It was around midnight in Winter yet it was temperate. I go to check the time downstairs and the clock is bland. Not even a second later I wake up in bed as if I had been teleported. This time the house is dusty, as if it had been left for years. As I head downstairs it is eerily quiet. The clock is blank again and it repeats. This time it is pitch black with no light source. The stairwell is strangely lit up and you can see the dust floating in the air. I see the clock, again blank, and then turn to see my siblings standing at the door. They have no face and their body is disfigured. I wake up again in a cold sweat.

A common theme is the lack of faces for some reason. It's not just the dreams either, everything feels off in general. Every decision I make now I will have an impact on the entire rest of my life (more-so than ever). Please could someone provide some context for me. Thank you.",1674239187.0
363,Dreams,My horrifying dream,"I (16F) just had the most blood curdling dream a teenager could have.

It started when I was waiting for my mom to pick me up early (I can't drive), the school principal called the school on lockdown because there was a freak trying to get in, I looked out the front door to see your basic Japanese ghost (long black hair with a white gown) trying to force her way into the school screaming ""IZABELA"" (which is my middle name), as soon as a security guard tried to pull her away, SHE STABBED HIM IN THE GUT. Me, as spooked as can be, ran to the bathrooms in fear. I was not going to let a freaky ghost BRUTALLY MURDER ME. then my dream cut to me at my sisters (30F) house, there was a door that was not usually there so I went to open it and saw that same ghost standing there, so I closed it as fast as I could, I started crying to my sister that there's this ghost out to get me and that she showed up to my school. cut to the car moment, im in the front seat with my sister (by the way she doesn't have a drivers license), driving me to my moms house, im checking my complexion in the mirror (I am comedically pale) when I notice that SAME GHOST behind us, (which im starting to think is a reflection of my mental issues following me everywhere I go) AND THIS TIME SHE JUMPS ON THE CAR SCREAMING MY MIDDLE NAME, then when im at my moms house my sister said she heard a door open, my brother ran outside the house as he was standing about 10 feet away from the door, my sister and I look at each other, my sister looks up and then covers my eyes telling me not to look, I hear moaning and groaning from the ghost, I take a peak and see the same ghost covered in blood LOOKING AT ME, I then take a look at my mom which is covered in fear and then my sister says to the ghost, ""don't hurt us, we don't know who you are"", the ghost leaped towards my mom KIDNAPPING HER. that's when I woke up crying my eyes out and screaming to the top of my lungs.",1674239025.0

I dreamt of waking up, feeling my body half paralyzed (not sure if it was a dream), my bedroom door was pushed open as if the wind had opened it, my blind were going all over the place and there was a strong wind coming from my bedroom door, 
I was trying to get up to close the door but my body felt so heavy, I crawled out of bed with a lot of effort and when I was at the foot of my bed, next to the door, I saw a little boy standing there, staring at me, as if I needed to wake up, 

I tried to scream but my voice was gone, the boy just stood there with a familiar face, and then I really woke up, and it was all a dream, my bedroom door was still closed and locked and all my windows were closed,

370,Dreams,I keep dreaming about the same man and it’s becoming a nightmare,"Hello, 

It all started a few years ago, when I first met him in a dream. We met cliche-enough by the park. 

Every time I dream about him now, it's a continuation of where we last left off. We've gone from strangers to married, and now he wants a child. I've always been uneasy about the idea of having a child, and I've told him multiple times that I don't want that. (I don't want to get pregnant in my dream ever again. if you have had a pregnancy dream you know how almost nightmarish it is to give birth.) But in my dreams, he's so persistent, and I have to force my self awake because when we argue it's like the world in the dream is falling apart. 

It's not just the arguments that are affecting me, it's the vividness of the dreams. They're so real that when I wake up, I feel like I'm stuck in an alternate universe. I also wake up with light migraines and in a panic.

I've also noticed that 60% of my dreams are nightmares, which I can control. But when I'm not running and fighting for my life, I dream about this man. And I can’t control anything other than force myself awake. And it's exhausting.

I had a dream last night that we went on a trip with his brother and things got heated when I asked him to tell my dream husband to stop asking me for a child. We argued and I woke up feeling exhausted, embarrassed and cranky. I don't want to have these dreams anymore. Fairytale dream my a$$.

I'm not sure if anyone else has these kinds of dreams, but I'm reaching out for help. I want to know if there's anything I can do to stop having them.

372,Dreams,"I feel like this dream is too specific to myself to google, was wondering if anyone has any ideas!","I always have the same dream, always In highschool (I’m 23 now) and a lot of times it involves my highschool boyfriend who I was with for 8 years. We were extremely toxic, we lived in a shitty apartment and he was alittle messy, but he wasn’t dirty and I never saw a single bug in there. That being said I’ve always been absolutely terrified of bugs (especially one that move, don’t die etc.) reallly my worst fear. The worst in my opinion is any black big bugs or cockroaches. However I have never seen the latter in real life. Anyways The dreams I have rarely take place in this apartment, I think because I didn’t move in until I was 20. Very recently (this week) I met a new guy I really like. This is the first guy I’ve had real feelings for, and the first guy I’ve stayed sober around (I used drugs with my ex).it was a very toxic, codependent, traumatic relationship. The new guy I’ve been seeing is the best. He’s treated me so well and he’s an amazing dad to his 5 year old. I know he’s safe, I’ve known him since 9 years old but we haven’t talked in years because we both were in really horrible relationships and he was straight up abused by his ex. My ex just didn’t care, for example multiple times he has put me in positions where I don’t feel safe like he would never come with me if it was late and I needed something out of my car, or to go home.. he never protected me and I think he thought girls weren’t any more unsafe then men, idk. That’s the background that I think is kind of important for context. Also just to add, I did not see or think about any bugs yesterday. Usually if I dream about something I can tie it back to something I saw or read that day, but not this time. The dream was as follows. I was in the apartment on the couch with my ex boyfriend and his old roomate (my childhood close friend) was with us and there was a bunch of people moving shit and clearing it out. I didn’t move out of that apartment because I had been on a break with him when he cleared it out and moved. I also didn’t help move in, I’ve never ever hired a moving company and I’ve also never really made any serious moves that I was conscious of. So in the dream, I can’t tell if their moving everything out or just my stuff. My ex was an alcoholic and they were clearing frozen(?) beers out of the fridge. While they were moving, I saw a bug on the wall. Just like in real life, I begged my ex to get it for me because I hate the sound and I hate getting close. The bug changed from a roach to a cricket (I lived in a  garage with him this past summer and they were everywhere) he finally got up but not without complaining. He half ass swatted it and missed causing it to run which has happened before in real life. I don’t remember much else as I woke up soon after, I was confused because I hadn’t had a bad dream in YEARS. They are always good and a form of escape for me. I really love my dreams as it seems to be different moments from my life before I had any responsibility, when drugs were “still fun” and lighter hearted than it eventually became. This dream felt different. I’m praying this is a sign I won’t go back to him this time. This new guy is such a good influence on me.. his son loves me and vice versa. I’ve never been comfortable with change, I have severe anxiety but recently I’ve been starting to feel better. I know I had another dream that was kind of shitty afterwards. I was being driven around in the back seat (which is strange because usually im driving) i don’t remember why, but I wasn’t in the car voluntarily and I can’t remember exactly why but it was definitely another bad dream.

373,Dreams,Last night I had probably worst nightmare of my life (I don't remember any details),"Hello guys, 26 M here and this is my first time posting here. First of all I wish to say that I have nightmares on extremely rare occasions (maybe twice a year on average) but I have normal dreams quite frequently and they always feel very realistic.

I have to dissapoint you but I do not remember any specific details about this nightmare. I do remember that it felt even more realistic than my regular dreams. I know it involved severe psychological torture and maybe possesion or something like that. It was so realistic and so intense that in this I dream I was seriously considering suicide just to escape that torture. When I woke up in the middle of the night it took me a while to realise it was all just a dream. 

I must say that I do not suffer from depression or any other illness and have never thought about killing myself. I also do not do any drugs (legal nor pharmaceuticall). I also haven't experienced any trauma that could possibly cause this nightmare. And because of this nightmare I am feeling very weird this whole day.

384,Dreams,dreams about the dead,"The last few nights I have been plagued by dreams about the dead. Plagued may not be the best word to use, as the dreams are actually not bad, but the sadness I experience once I wake up is what's hard.

The first dream, and sorry, the details at this point are a bit vague, was a few days ago. I grew up in Germany, in the dream I went to see my grandpa in Germany, My German grandma having died in 2021. When we get to the house, my dad is emptying out the house, because of his mom (My other grandma that actually lives in the US), having just passed (she passed in April of last year), and it being time to get rid of her stuff. So, I help move her stuff into a truck. No real conclusion to the dream.

Last night, I was going to go on a trip with my Wife and I, so we visit my Aunt who is watching my dogs. We get there to find out, she is preparing for a get together as a bit of a memorial to another Grandpa I had (didn't have much of a relationship with him, met him maybe 3 or 4 times my whole life, before he passed away in 2021). People start showing up and my Uncle (who passed away from a motorcycle accident in 2012) shows up. I get excited, as I know he is dead, and he explains heaven is treating him well (I don't even believe in heaven) and he just there to say hi to people and we hang out a little bit.

I say no,  and they lead me to a small elevator on the side of one of the buildings in the game, jumped and it looked like just a retro early 2000 administration office kind of room. With a large armored crate in the middle. Once opened there were two red cards in the box with the words ""OCX Corp."" And then I say ""ooooh this is from the game you gave me!"" So we pick up the red cards and it grants us these really OP mini guns. And beat the rest of the campaign.  

I call my friend because I somehow forgot the name the game originated from ""Twin Team Revolution""  he says ""ohhh yeah that's right now I remember.""  the gimmick of that game was you were office workers finding cards with weapons so you could escape your demon infested workplace. Just so happens the company you work for, OCX Corp,  can help with that, and the cards were color coded for rarity. Blue for common weapons, yellow for rare and red for OP. There were only 2 red cards in the whole game. 

Once I got my answer, I proceeded to say, ""ok I'm gonna go back to sleep"" only for them to  just try to keep me awake so we could play a round. I was legitimately pretending to snore....in a dream. I did eventually actually wake up and got super  confused in everything.

387,Dreams,Anubis?,"Tl;dr: after a nightmare I saw a dancing Anubis and 111. 



Good morning. I’m asking this while everything is still fresh in my mind. 

Long story short: I had a nightmare. The nightmare consisted of me and a couple of friends in a high school gym that was doubling as a sleeping hall for students, maybe a bunker, idk. A ghost (who kind of looked like Bubbles from Trailer Park Boys but not quite) was then attempting to come after me. I tried to scream over and over again before I finally could, the ghost started to scream “No!” back to me over and over again. When he lurched out to grab me, I woke up. 

Here is the part that’s confusing me. 

Laying in the dark, my eyes were making weird shapes. Because I had just come out of a dream I figured my eyes were playing tricks on me, but it looked as if I were looking through the eyes of someone looking down to me. I would move my head or arm and then watch myself move. Then - and I promise you I do not do drugs - it’s like I could see Anubis in the dark stand up by my bed and start… dancing? Like that Egyptian Walk dance? I thought I still HAD to be sleeping, but no I was awake and I can only assume I was hallucinating. I looked at my watch expecting to be like 3 am but it was 1:11. I know this to be the angel number of new beginnings. I don’t know if I believe in such things but then when I looked up Anubis, I saw that not only is the Egyptian dirty of the underworld, but also for new beginnings. BUT I WAS AWAKE.

At this point i “knew” that i wasnt gonna make it to the top and that im gonna fall soon, but i didnt have any other choice but to keep going till i fall. Since i wasnt able to look at how much stairs is left for me to climb, i could only assume that there is a long long way to go and that it will only get harder and that im probably gonna die.

I had some trouble sleeping last night, I smoked a cigarette before I went to bed but that's about it. Got in bed, sat there for like an hour, and try to go to sleep. I felt like I was having sleep paralysis so before I did I kind of did this jerking motion with my leg to keep me awake. I felt more tired then ive ever been (which is odd) this is what happened.

I noticed me and my girlfriend were watching a game live, I think it was wrestling and I noticed she was grinding her seat and staring at the boy on top of another one. I was kind of zoned out the time and my mental health was weird, so I didn't say anything but a day passed and I asked her about it and she told me ""there was this girl crying in my shoulders and I looked at him and I got carried away immediately. He took me to a better place."" I remember saying vividly and crying ""I was supposed to take you away.""  i was so angered with jealousy i ruined the entire
school by throwing books everywhere and screaming, completely blind and red with rage. In the midst of all this I couldn't tell when a dream ended and one begun, there had to be multiple sequences and it felt like hours before i woke up. I was very scared the entire time. The whole thing was like an acid trip. after this i remember getting up out of the dream, standing in front of my mirror and my eyes were black (not the scelara just the pupils) then going back to sleep. this is what happened after.

dream two (between two sequences i dont remember)

 I was staying in a studio apartment with one of my closest friends and a few of his other rapper friends and we were making music while we were renting it out. Somehow, for some reason, I lashed out and me him had a terrible fight with each other and had to be separated. I got kicked out and was homeless.

after i woke up i noticed it was thundering and wet outside like a storm had passed while i was dreaming. my pupils were almost not even there. 

i am very worried. please help me figure this out.",1674212349.0
399,Dreams,Does anyone else “feel” when they’re going to have a bad dream?,"Well good luck me explaining this but I’ll try my best. 

I don’t have bad dreams very often, but I’ve noticed when I do it’s usually preceeded in the day by a body feeling. It feels like dread I guess, or like an anxiety but it’s not. I get this almost physical sensation of being crowded and feeling heavy and oppressed, even if there’s nothing going on that I can pinpoint that would make me feel like that. 

Sometimes I just notice this feeling and I’m like “oh I’m gonna have a bad dream tonight,” and always do?

It was a weird anime opening like scene. First I was on a giant seahorse, then suddenly I take a trip to space without a helmet on a toy plane, then it goes back to earth and crashes into a volcano

There was a song sung by unknown people to me and at one point, during the space flight, the song questions why I'm not wearing a helmet, then concluding it's a dream.

The dream ended in me and a bunch of unknown people running down a hill as the song ended ""this fire mine is strong, it has no handle, I want nothing more"". (Translated as it wasn't in English)",1674210698.0

404,Dreams,Harry Potter Dream,"I had a dream that one of the Death Eaters shape-shifted into an old lady and went up to Harry while he was wandering Knockturn Alley. They whispered to him in passing to go to the docks where he’ll find the broken tip of the ship (the bow?) in the top drawer of an old chest of drawers under the bridge, and that he needed to keep it safe from his enemies.

Harry went down to the docks and found the broken bow. He reached for it and when he touched it, it turned out to be a Portkey.

The Portkey teleported him into a dark dungeon full of rats. Harry, confused about his whereabouts and why an old lady made him teleport here, whispered “lumos” to check out his surroundings. A large figure loomed behind him. It was a very large human-size rat.

It was Peter Pettigrew. Peter angrily yelled at Harry, “YOU CAN’T BE HERE.”

He had a wooden fence containing a bunch of these monstrosities. Their heads were almost as long as the body, maybe 60% as long. I say they are ravens but they might have just been big crows.

411,Dreams,Befriending a murderer??,"Took a melatonin last night which always makes my dreams more vivid.

Dreamed I was still in school, maybe middle school. There was a boy in a lot of my classes named something like ‘Balduhr’ or ‘Baldrum.’ 

He was wicked smart and crafty and would secretly set traps and get lots of kids to take fake drugs that were actually poison and lots of them would die.

I guess I was the only one who could see what he was really doing because he was so sly and the teachers all thought he was great. 

I was young and not credible I guess because nobody believed me.

Eventually though I decided to talk to him and be nice to him. I told him I liked him but I was afraid of him. I asked him to hang out with my group of friends that he was not really apart of.

Then he said he liked me too and I felt this affection for him and started really liking him. I could see that he was lonely and felt left out even though everyone respected him and admired his intelligence.

I’m pretty sure that was the end of him secretly killing people and I remember wanting to get to know him better before I woke up.

Should I accept my demons and let them in instead of shutting them out? Will that make things better? Or am I reading too much into this lol. Also I had just listened to Odesza Intro on their A Moment Apart album the day before and maybe the message in that song got in my head",1674195300.0

Since, i’ve been sporadically having this dream, with a few altercations with people or specific events but the premise of the dream remains the same. 

Usually, I find out i’m getting married. I usually don’t know who I’m getting married to at first, but I do find out later in the dream. 

Im filled with a sense of dread and in the dreams I usually try planning an escape. Sometimes I try running away, sometimes I try fighting my partner so I don’t end up with them. 

All i know if that I DONT want to get married (despite them being occasions where I find the person im courted to very attractive) 

In half of those dreams, I end up pregnant with a baby, and those dreams always end with me going hysterical trying to remove the baby from me or ending myself. For me, the baby would mean Im tied to the marriage permanently. 

Most of those dreams do end with me harming myself to get out of the marriage.

415,Dreams,Good dream last night: I found a craft room!,"I have a persistent realm (location visited in multiple dreams) that I call the hoarder's house. My husband and I own the house, but the previous owner was a hoarder, and they left their stuff behind when they sold the house. 

Dreams that take place here involve sorting through the hoard, deciding what to keep, and getting rid of some things. In one previous dream, I pulled up some broken floorboards and found a cellar full of old books, some of which were being used to hold up the floor. In another, I found a shelf with hundreds of board games on it, and I could hardly wait to open them up, replace any missing pieces, and make them playable. It's always fun and cheerful, like a treasure hunt.

Last night, I dreamed I was at the hoarder's house again, and I found a craft room. I knit and color in waking life, so for me this was the ultimate find. There were knitting needles, many colors of thread, and lots of fabric, including some strips of fuzzy material that I decided to get rid of right away. There were loads of markers, and when I looked through them I was pleased to find some colored pencils as well. Then I looked behind a curtain and gasped with surprise. There was a quilting rack set up with a half-finished quilt still on it. Various rulers and pairs of scissors hung from the ceiling.

I had a lovely time. I hope some night I'll be able to go back and hunt for more treasures.",1674193096.0

For some reason the older child was facing the opposite direction and the wall, while the other two were oddly close and facing me. As the person was facing the wall, they ask me a question, and as I attempted to reply, they turned to face me with this wildly distorted face, (large glossy dark eyes and a stretched out twisted grin) and I immediately could not move or speak even though I was trying with all my power.

421,Dreams,Contacts through Dreams. 100% true," 

I'm going to show you something that you might find interesting. Dreams are much more than they seem. We all have them, they occur on a plane we don't know, and they receive echoes from the space-time line. As if that were not enough, there are entities, beings that do not have a biological body and can use dreams to transcend messages. And these are validated because they use the time line. By showing an event from the future, they make you understand that the communication was real when it happened.

There are many cases. I have a list on my insta. And they are all publicly accessible. I'm going to put one of the last ones because I'm going through these days. I am going to tell it, explain it and then through the link that I am going to leave, they will be able to verify everything I tell. Sure, if you're interested. Because the idea is to reach people who may be interested and not have to read ignorant nonsense. If you're not interested, go ahead and save the malicious comment.

I dream that I write down January 12, 2023. I write it down on my cell phone, notepad with date and time. Then, when I'm more awake, I post it on my social media. Especially Twitter. It cannot be modified, it has a certain date provided by servers.

War zone. A family. A young teenager wanted to drive. A boy maybe a little older, started a car. And we went for a walk... we were in front of a building destroyed in the middle, and in one of the bathrooms that had been left outside, a band was playing nice music. I stopped and exclaimed ""nice acoustic"". Then we crossed a gate, and we arrived like a river. A missile hit us and we fell into the water. And we were crouched by the shore. The young man who started the car was injured. He hid inside a boat and the enemy grabbed him. He told me that his body was going to be tied to a post. I don't know what he meant to tell me.

Dreams are a language. Everyone thinks they know something and that if you don't give dates and times or the matter isn't exact, it's just the product of your imagination. But that is a prejudice, a bias from a person who knows nothing about the subject. Believing you know is not having knowledge on the subject.

Following... two days later, January 14, 2023. A missile falls on a building in the Ukrainian city of Dnipro. Which is located on the shore of a river, which has a similar name. The city is named after this river. The first piece of news I found spoke of 9 dead and 60 missing. And that a 15-year-old girl had died. The building was literally split in the middle.

And there we have... the building, the young woman, the missile, the river. The boat is missing, right? January 16, 2023, I think... maybe 18, it happens that Russia denies the matter. He says it was probably Ukraine's anti-missile system. And from the Ukraine, he says they hit the building with an rh22 missile. An anti-ship missile. That they do not have the technology to stop that type of missile.

Perhaps the post where the wounded youth was hung or tied... was the missile. You see, in dreams the communications are somewhat different. Here we chat, we talk as I do at this moment I tell you about these events. In dreams, it's like a movie. More visual, more metaphorical. They didn't say, hey, we're from a city where there's a huge river that gave its name to this metropolis. Rather, they took me there. and they showed how the missile came from the water. or, it served or is used for large and metallic things like a warship.

That's why I laugh when they say, che, without dates it's just your madness that you accommodate a boleo fact that fits what you say. How many missiles fell on a building lately? Look on the net, it hasn't happened for several months. Like 10. I mean, what do you know skinny? pay attention and learn.

And this is how a small note that corresponds to a dream tells us about a future event. 2 days. And it was all over the news. Even the Pope condemned him on Twitter.

Do you think it's just a case? Well no. They are many. Everyone tells something different obviously, related to his life, his end. But, there is not only death, there are other things. Like advancing Messi's change of course to another club or winning the third world cup. If I can leave a second link with Messi's dream announcing a third world cup before Christmas, I will. The dream says, three little bottles under a tree. The translation was, win the third cup near Christmas. That's why I try to explain to them that dreams are a language. Well, just let me put a link. If they ask for it, I make another post and put it up for them to see.

I was learning a bit about her, how she had a innocence about her and it was growing. She was getting closer to not being able to care for herself, she was getting closer to death. It wasn’t set in a realistic version of this world necessarily. A little close but a little off, you know how dreams are. Towards the end of the dream us 3 were at the mall. We were sitting in the lounge chairs and I was holding the baby and we were all just sitting in peaceful silence when some guys came and sat next to her and started taunting her a little, I told them to stop and swatted at them to send them away and gave them the biggest glare I could. She wasn’t aware they were messing with her, she kind of always had an innocent small and amused smile on her face. They went away but as I did that I lost my grip on the baby a little bit and had to make sure I didn’t drop him. It came close. I realized I needed to chill and take a little break from holding the baby before I do something dumb like that again. I handed her the baby and she happily grabbed him and since I had just learned her story and was just pushed into watching them I didn’t know if this was something I was supposed to say to her or not but I just felt in that moment that how could I not? I just said to her “yeah that’s your baby” with a big smile on my face because of how lovingly she was looking down at him. After I said that though she handed me back the baby kind of fast with her smile fading almost completely and for the first time I saw her she looked really sick, like a shell of herself. Because in that moment she became aware that she has a baby that she doesnt remember and that she’ll never know him. I started to feel such immense pain staring at the emotion on her face. I woke up a few seconds after and my heart was beating so fast because it was so heart breaking and I’m still thinking about her face and the pain she must have been feeling. And the fact that even if in a dream, I’ll never know how long she had to sit with that pain for, if it’s the one and only time she’ll be aware, what will happen to the baby boy.

I dreamed one of my best friends gave me a really warm hug and told me something in my ear but his voice kept cutting to static so I couldn’t understand the whole thing. It was something like, “I deeply care about you but I don’t like *static*”

447,Dreams,does chasing a car have meaning in a dream?,"In my dream I had to chase a car I was trying to get in it but I couldn't because another car was in the way, so they would back up and then go back in the stupid parking space. And when I thought they'd finally let me in they drove away 🙄 I chased after them and I wanna know if somehow this has meaning because I like the idea of dreams having meaning. Also what does it mean if it turned into a strawberry car?",1674158282.0
448,Dreams,A dream about a deceased friend,"In one part of my dream tonight I met a man I knew that recently passed away. Or more accurately, I met his wife and only saw him through a photo series that she had taken of them through the years. It was like a professional exhibition, but she told me she only had photography as a hobby. The pictures were of them in different memories, happy and in love. Then pictures of her alone, growing old as he had passed. It was extremely painful and I think I even woke up crying. 

In another part of the dream she told me about his death, but it was like it was part of a news report on tv. He had been mistreated and a victim of malpractice at some type of hospital. I think she tried to get him justice. She told me that he had said to her that they (at the hospital?) had hit/clubbed his hands, forced them into cold water and made him swallow sea water.  I believe he passed away from complications.

The thing is that I don’t actually know how he died irl, though I’m about 99% sure he committed suicide, since he was suicidal and had tried several times before. Is this dream trying to tell me something else? He also didn’t have a wife irl, he’d been divorced for many years and was very lonely. I think that’s why the dream made me extra sad.

Context/My own interpretation: 
In general it’s not weird I’m dreaming about him since I’m still in chock and just starting to process his passing. The malpractice/torture part might actually just represent metaphorically how he was treated in the psychiatry and never got help. He also suffered from a neurological disorder which mostly affected his hands, hence his hands getting hurt in the dream? The only thing I can’t make sense of is the wife and photo exhibition. Maybe it’s just my own projection of what I wished he had had.",1674158012.0
449,Dreams,Had a dream that was stupid and made no sense but very disturbing,"My dream started off with my dad driving me and other people that I didn’t even know in the car around the street. He was talking to someone but I couldn’t see who but my dad was acting very strange. I suddenly then started to smell gas in the car and I felt really unsettled and confused. My dad then drove violently in the wall of a building and it grew very hot. Everyone else in the car was panicking except for him. He looked back at me as the first thing that came to my mind was that he was going to commit suicide and take all of us with him. I immediately ran out of the car to get help and my dad chased after me, expect that he was very slow. I tried calling out for him but everyone in the city was ignoring me. Then my dad finally stopped chasing me and walked away. I don’t remember what happened after that but I do remember that there was a live stream on YouTube and it was the same car except my dad wasn’t inside it, it was a whole different family and the mom was filming her children and her oldest kid who was tied to the top of the car burning alive in the car that was completely on fire. I could only hear the kid that was on top of the car screaming and crying. I’m not sure what happened after that either. But the last part of my dream was some random girl trying to gain my trust and kill me but her acting was so obvious. And that was about it.",1674156284.0
450,Dreams,I've dreamt of afterlife. It was horrifying.,"I'll try my best to describe my dream, and I'd be grateful if someone could tell me if it means anything. I was woken up in a small room with a boy sitting on a bed. There was a window right over it, so I came up to it, opened it and for a while thought of jumping. The boy just looked at me, but I finally got back into the room, the height was freaking me out. When I did it, the scenario changed. I found myself at a big pool with my friends. I tried to go into the pool, but the only way to do so were the stairs. After arriving at the top, water was gone, and so were my friends. That's when I asked myself a question what was going on. Somehow I came to the conclusion that this must be the afterlife. I recalled that what I remember doing last is going to sleep, so that's how I must've died. I was literally on my knees, praying that this all just a sick joke, and that I'm still alive. Instead the background changed one more time, this time it was a war. Everyone shooting and fighting, but somehow I escaped. In that moment, I was sure that I'm dead. I started crying, but when I opened my eyes it was my bedroom once again. In my nightmare, not even once have i thought that this could all be a dream. I was just so glad to know I'm alive. I don't know why or how, but I was and still am sure this was the afterlife. It all was just horrifying, so strange, that I was going mad. And I know that from my description it doesn't sound scary at all, but in fact everything that happened in the dream, seems to be the things I'm frightened of. Is there any possible meaning, to this dream?",1674155960.0

452,Dreams,had another dream about narrowly escaping death,"this was last night and it was a pretty crazy one. i was outside with a bunch of my old friends and just people in general in a field. maybe like the football field of a high school. and i was talking to my friend and we see a plane descending and we see smoke. as i look up the plane crashes to the ground right in front of my and i fall back. i look at the friend and say ""if i was any closer i probably would've died"". we both laugh it off and thats when i wake up. 

now the weird thing is that when i was getting ready for school i checked the news and saw that there was a plane crash very recently a couple cities over and it killed 4 people.  i don't think it has any correlation but its just weird that i see that as soon as i wake up from having a dream like that.",1674154416.0

455,Dreams,Another reality,"The other night I had a dream that I was telling my parents I was pregnant, I was a little older than I am now, more attractive &amp; seemed to be doing somewhat well in life but I wasn’t married to the man who got me pregnant &amp; I didn’t want to tell my parents who it was. I ended up having twins, I remember the birth, arguments with the father &amp; learning how to coparent with him. I hated him at times but after a while I started to love him because of how good of a dad he was. I wanted him to love me but he didn’t so I went through a depressive period, at this time the twin boys are about eight years old. Then all of a sudden they were ten in fifth grade &amp; I dropped them off at school &amp; then I went on a podcast where I spoke about coparenting &amp; being a young mother of twins. The girl on the podcast with me was attractive &amp; I started to develop a crush on her when I woke up, mid podcast the dream ended &amp; I realized I don’t have twin boys I’m actually a 22 year old girl living with my brother &amp; his wife &amp; I don’t even have a boyfriend.

457,Dreams,Creepy train to the North Pole,"K had this dream where me and a bunch of other kids were in this train when all of a sudden a bunch of gremlins started to lock all the windows and exits, I managed to get to a door in time right when I can face to face with a gremlin it then tried to usher me back inside before I gave it a good curb stomp, heard the snapping of its neck and everything, then a small group of them overwhelmed me back into the train and headed back towards the door, they didn’t lock it, then some creepy tall looking gnomish looking version of Santa came in through the unlocked door and stood in front of me, it took my red stocking and then replaced it with another, this stocking was full of coal… and it had barbed wires around the top rim, and the rest of the stocking was a darker shade of red, and it eerily smelled funny, next thing I know the train is heading towards a frozen lake which had no tracks, once we got to it tho however the train roared and plunged itself down into the ice where we ended up at the bottom of the lake, there were tracks down there, cages, corpses, and lots of withers forgotten cities, all of the withering buildings had these yellow and green lights around them, illuminating all the skeletal remains and bodies which were chained to the floor wrapped in something. The train started filling with water as it continued down its watery rail, and soon I couldn’t breath everyone else looked terrified, we saw some of the windows open up, giving me the idea of escaping, only to see these enormous leeches swoop through the unlatched windows, they had multiple eyes and this gross sperm like body. They latched onto our faces, and then to my surprise they started giving us air, at this point the dream was becoming too much for me so I woke up, it has been one of the most vivid dreams I’ve had in a while…",1674153278.0
458,Dreams,River in the sky.,I had a dream last night that was slightly inception-ish. I was at this mansion and there was a beautiful river flowing in the sky above it. You could see tree roots and fish flowing through. At some point I became aware I was dreaming and “woke up”. But in reality I was still dreaming. I was telling people about this river in the sky and was told as a collective the river in the sky is only seen at this one house. And everyone who dreams this River are all seeing it in the same house. I “fall back asleep” and I’m back in the house. I’m searching the house to understand why all dreamers come to this house and a very large black oval floats over to me and engulfs me.

460,Dreams,Have you ever woke up...laughing? I just had a hilarious DBZ dream...," So....my brain literally was cracking me up this morning, as I woke up. I dreamed that Goku and Chi-Chi had a baby (IDK if they were Gohan or Goten, or someone else, my brain didn't specify), and Bulma called Goku, asking if he wanted to talk to the little guy. Bulma puts the phone next to the baby, as Goku asks the little  dude how he's doing. The baby then proceeds to somehow answer in a 30 second speil of technical jargon, in a monotonous voice, that makes zero sense. Bulma then wonders out loud how she's supposed to turn the auto-translater off. Goku, already tired of hearing the auto-generated jargon, simply says 'Bah...', and hangs up.

462,Dreams,Moving back in with parents and going to college,"My parents sold their house and decided to start renting a 2 bed 2 bath apartment. I guess I wasn't doing so great so I moved back in with them. We did some things and talked a bit, but can't recall the specifics of anything. After a bit, I notice that I haven't seen Daisy, the chiweenie they've had since I was 12, though she was always considered to be my dog since I'm the one who loves dogs the most in my family (couldn't take her with me when moving out since I don't think I can afford a pet, but I still see her every 2-3 weeks when I see my parents). I ask them what happened to her, and they said they put her down since they couldn't bring her. I broke down and cried. 

I then make my way to the college I dropped out of a few years ago, I was coming back to the new semester to finish my degree. The new semester started within the next few days, and I was looking through my class schedule, it turns out I had enrolled in 7 classes, on top of my full time job, which is the reason I dropped out in the first place. I decided to drop the in person classes and only take the online ones, so I was left with 3 or 4.

I'm now back at the apartment, and it's haunted. It's mostly just doors opening and closing on their own, and items moving around. I decide to film one day while in my room, and the bedroom door opens with no one behind it.",1674149079.0
463,Dreams,A strangely detailed dream I had that I can remember clearly,"So in this dream it was my dad’s car but I drove it. I got into a minor accident so I and the other driver pull into an empty parking lot but instead of doing what you’re supposed to after an accident (I don’t know what you’re supposed to do lol I’ve luckily never been in a car accident) the woman got out of her car and ran into mine and stole it. I ran after her and she didn’t go far, she went to a grocery store that was less than a block away. When she got out of the car I threatened her with a small pocket knife and she ran into the store. I ran after her but the store was busy so I was having trouble keeping track of her. Eventually I do get to her but she’s got three young children with her now, one that’s being held in her arms. I immediately feel bad bc the kids look scared and I give up on trying to get back at the lady. Feeling defeated I walk back to the parking lot where we had parked earlier. For some reason my dad is there and he’s like “where’s the car?” and I tell him I didn’t know and he just kind of shrugs it off. The lady’s car is still there so I decide to just take her car and my dad has no issue with this and doesn’t ask any questions about it and we drive away. And that’s when I woke up",1674148206.0

465,Dreams,Dreamt about girl sitting on my lap,"So earlier today, at some point I know it was way longer than this instant. This dream I had went to this like it was this sort of meeting hall but it looked very familiar. it was from a movie I know but I can’t remember which exact one, all I know is that it’s old. Anyways there was some mysterious man giving a speech and but I don’t remember any of their faces. A couple minutes in, someone needed a place to sit so this girl I was sitting with (who I had been with this whole dream and flirting with. Not to mention she was very pretty). She had crammed on to my seat to give room to the other person. We ended up having to sit half and half on my chair. I guess she got tired of it and decided to just sit on my lap and I was pretty surprised but kind of weirded out too. I didn’t know where to grab her since I liked her in the dream and I didn’t want to make it uncomfortable but at the same time I wanted to hold her. As I was contemplating it, everything just ended and I woke up. It sucked like crazy like I just couldn’t believe that it was over and I’d never see her again. Within seconds I didn’t even remember their names or faces. Only thing I can remember is she was wearing a pink skirt but that’s it. I don’t know what it means.

Not only that I’ve had similar dreams like this too and every time I forget just their faces but not their clothes. But I always see that girl at least once every like 5 months in my dreams. I know I don’t know her because I’ve never actually seen her in real life or any party or anything I remember. When it’s not her, it’s my friends or school or something. All of this starting to really suck since it’s either these perfect worlds or some fucked up dream about missing the whole year, end of the world or death. It’s almost like my mind is trying to just mess with me and show me all these things that I know I won’t have, will happen to me or are impossible in this world.

Anyway, in both dreams he would hit on me (flirting), in the first it was in a more discreet way and in the second it was VERY direct.

I remember seeing myself sat there from the perspective of something else, like a third person view. What’s strange is the fact that whilst I was watching myself, I was also experiencing what I can only describe as Nirvana as the sat down and meditative me. 

It’s like I was watching myself experience Nirvana whilst also being the one experiencing it, but I was conscious about the experience. It felt amazing, it felt like I just knew, my mind was completely clear except for the conscious thought that my mind was clear. 

It was very strange. Does anyone have any input or similar experiences?",1674125852.0
481,Dreams,Dreaming about a name I didn't know it exists but it does,"Hi fellow redditors 😊

I dream a lot. My dream are usually like movies, very organized with kinda logical events. Maybe it's because I'm a writer so I day dream a lot. I often use my dreams as a base to write books.

Last night, I had a dream that was wonderful, it was a long, detailed dream about a girl that could fly and had psychic abilities like making people fall in love with each other.

The flying part was gracious, she flew over the see to an island, she was fighting bad people in a war and was a kind of spy.

Then she was in a house with other people (was my grandparents house irl if that matters) and they were having lunch. Then German guys come with a Russian guy the girl knew. When they walked in the garden alley and she saw the Russian guy she called his name and ran to hug him. 

It was something I remembered didn't remember well in the morning and settled like Drako (like Drako Malfoy), I just googled Drako and Russian and the name Darko came out, which it exactly the one from my dream. I feel weird about it. It's a Slavic name I didn't know. I'm not Russian or Slavic in anyway.

Back to the dream, the girl and Darko sit in the living room and talk in Russian while the other guests are puzzled because they were not aware she spoke Russian. She says he taught her ten years before in East Berlin. There was a very strong bound between that Darko and the girl.

I started writing a story from that dream because it felt so vivid.

Have you ever experienced something similar?",1674123747.0
482,Dreams,Recurring Guy in Dreams,"So, I don’t really know where else to take this kind of thing? I've been combing this and the other dream/psychic subs for a while now, so I figured it was as good a place as any to drop this all lmao. 

But I (17f) have been having recurring dreams of the same guy for months now, and I just kinda need to get everything out of my system and know that I at least tried to get who I’ve seen out there, on the off-chance he actually exists or something. I have absolutely no idea who he is or if he's real or not, and I know for sure that I’ve never met him before. (And science-wise, the brain can only recreate faces it's seen, so it's extra weird bc I know damn well I have never seen this guy ever.). I have synesthesia and meditate before I go to sleep most nights, so I’m used to weird, vivid, repetitive sorts of dreams, but these are entirely different to what I’ve seen in the past.

For context purposes, I’ve been having these dreams for around 6 months. And they're happening at least bi-monthly, usually more. The typical time I go in-between each dream is around a week and a half. And I’ve noticed I always see him around the same sorts of times. Between 3-5pm, if I ever lay down for a nap, and 8-11pm, when a normal person running on typical 9-5 hours would sleep. 

Along with this weird schedule, he’s always acutely aware he’s in MY dream. Not his own or another world entirely, like a lot of people in dreams tend to think, but 100% my dream. He comments on this a lot, and will use it to wake me up if things seem to be going downhill (I get really bad nightmares fairly often), as well as keep me asleep for extended periods of time, sometimes even causing me to sleep through alarms on accident. He can tell when I’m particularly tired, and possibly won’t remember a dream as well as I might have if I was just taking a nap, and has even gone so far as to comment on the time in-between our interactions. Little things, such as, “It’s been a while since I’ve seen you.” or, “Where have you been? Are you not sleeping right?”

He interacts with the dream world and myself as if he was just someone who happened to be lucid, and made his way into my head for the night. I’d say it's creepy, and to be honest, it used to really freak me out, but I’ve gotten used to it. And I’ve grown to find a lot of comfort in knowing that, regardless of how bad a day I might have had, or how upset I might be when I go to bed, there's a chance I’ll see him on the other side. And I’ll have a safe space for a little while, no matter where we are.

Which is something else worth mentioning. Typically, we’re never in the same spot twice. He always shows up in random dreams, at what feels like random times. And whenever I lucid dream, (which is regularly, I love it.), I actively look for him. Nine times out of ten, he's not there, but on the off-chance he is, it’s almost like he’s lucid too, just waiting for me to stumble across him, wherever he happens to be.

With all that being said, I can sort of round back to my first point. This is weird as all hell and not normal. At least, the people I’ve talked to and asked about this all say it's not. I vividly remember each time I see him, how he looks, how he smells, his body language, interests, hobbies, everything. Even if I can recall nothing else about the rest of the dream, I remember the portion that had him in it. 

I’m working on compiling every dream I’ve had of him and all the art I’ve made for future reference, (I doodle him a lot in my free time lol) but this post would be way too long and convoluted if I went through every single thing I've ever made. So for now, as I'm having trouble getting any art off my tablet and don't want to make this post any bigger than it already is :,) I've tacked on a quick physical description of him instead. There's a small portion of me banking on the fact that this guy is real and dreams about me too, even though I know that chance is very, very low. So if you've seen him too or know who he is–or hell, if you ARE him and the description sounds like you, on the off chance–please offer what you can. I know it probably seems silly, but I really miss him. Six months of weird dreams about the prettiest, most considerate guy you've ever met does something to a girl idk. I’ve tried to bullet point everything for efficiency, but I’ve never done this before, so apologies in advance!

Also, thank you so much for taking the time to read this all. I know It’s kind of rambly and most definitely does not include everything I know about him, but I feel like it's a good basis for discussion. Even if there’s just someone out there with a similar experience, everything helps. :) &lt;3

&amp;#x200B;

Physical Description - 

Height: Around 5’7-5’9. For art context when it gets posted, I’m barely 5’4.

Weight: I would not be able to say in pounds or stone. But I’d say about average? Average weight? Not malnourished, but also not overweight at all. Average,,, yeah,,,,,

Age: Between 17-19. All I know is that he’s older than me in some capacity, even if it’s just by a bit. But I don’t figure It’s by a lot. 

Eye Color: Blue. Literally the most gorgeous sky blue I have ever seen. They have a gray rim around the outside, if that helps at all.

Hair Color: Sandy, almost bleach blond. I’ve taken to calling him ‘Bondie’, since I haven't been able to remember his name, of all things. 

Hair length: Just to his shoulders, cut evenly, but you can tell it’s sort of worn-in. No bangs or anything like that, just straight and long. 

As well as all this, I've heard his name once or twice from other people, but can never seem to remember it. (I have a hunch that because it's not directly spoken by him, my brain doesn't count it as all that important, especially in comparison to the guy himself.) But I know that it's short, starts with E, J, L, A, or N, and has a very similar vibe when spoken to something like 'Elijah' or 'Liam'.

His interests, from what I've learnt, are photography/videography, gaming in any capacity, (though his favorites are things like Stardew Valley, Minecraft, Terraria, etc. mostly chill sorts of sandbox games.), true crime and psychology, and cards. He's almost always in some sort of card-playing or logic-based scenario, and one of the first times I met him was in a casino, after I'd lost my phone, and he let me borrow his. 

Literally all of this is just typical teenage boy stuff, too. A lot of which I've never tried out or am not interested in myself, yet have been told accurate facts about. So I think it's pretty obvious why I'm going kind of bonkers here :,)   


TLDR; Weird blonde boy follows me around my dreams for 6 months, tells me accurate facts about stuff I've never done and media I've never consumed. I wave a 'LOST: IF FOUND CALL \[   \]' poster around like he's a missing cat.

483,Dreams,I get a lot of prescient dreams,"Usually what happens is I get sort of a ""vision"" when I sleep? It happens 4 out of 7 nights a week usually. So when I'm having a dream, the ""vision"" flashes for less than a second (because it wasn't related to my dream or something) or my dream builds up (not how it builds up to happen in real life) to the vision and when I wake up I forget everything that happened in the dream including the vision, but when I wake up and do something that was apparently the vision, I get flooded in my head by my dream, but the rest of the dream is less than a second long, and the part that was a vision of real life stays for as long as it takes me to process it. For example I could be doing something very specific in the dream, like watching a specific video on YouTube at a specific minute and second, and then doing a specific question on my homework at the same time, and that vision will flash for a few seconds in my dream, disappear, and when I do it in real life, it flashes in my head that I'm doing exactly what my dream said I would. It's quite weird, at least for me, everyone I've asked about it said they don't get this and that I'm weird or that my thoughts are questionable for doing this. Do you also experience prescient dreaming like this?",1674122602.0
484,Dreams,What does my bad dream mean?,"I had a dream last night, I was on a plane and I had my seatbelt on, however I was adamant that there was another seatbelt I had to put on from the ceiling (some sort of second seatbelt), I was panicking so much, and I felt nobody was really helping me find it. (Obviously, because there is no second seatbelt). The plane started down the runway, really fast, and I thought the plane would go upside down and I’d fall out (Imagine you’re on a rollercoaster without the seatbelt thing that goes over your head and down your torso), that’s how it felt. 

For context, I’ve been through a weird break/breakup recently of a 4 year relationship (I’m 22, he’s 23), and there’s possibly somebody else in the equation as of recent, but nothing serious at all. I love my ex? If we’re gonna call him that, (I’m not in denial, as the break/breakup was my idea). I haven’t been single or has much freedom since I was 14, and with so many bad things happening from both parties in our relationship, I needed a break to work on myself and find myself for the first time possibly in my life (some sort of midlife crisis at the age of 22).
I didn’t know if this may or may not have had something to do with the stressful dream? I’m down for spiritual, superstitious or any answers at all. I rarely have bad dreams, but this one was so real.",1674121921.0
485,Dreams,Why are my dreams like this :/,"I had a dream about my aunt, who I’m quite close to. She has two young boys who I love so much. In the dream she died in a horrible accident, yet she was still walking around like normal, decomposing from the inside out. She was trying to find her children so she could say goodbye to them before she crossed over, all whilst coughing up her guts - literally - and her skin flaking away. I was scream crying the entire dream. 

I couldn’t stop thinking about it so I thought maybe I should write about it.",1674120763.0
486,Dreams,Does my dream mean anything?,"On the night from Tuesday to Wednesday (17/01/2023 to 18/01/2023) i had a dream of me, real life and VRChat friends playing a horror game, except there were no jumpscares, just an eerie and creepy environment.

We explored the house, splitting into groups of 2 or more people. 

Soon one of the groups came across 2 girls, the people who came across them called us and the rest, me included, went to them. Then soon after we arrived the girls gave us a test. 

I got a pretty good score on it but no matter what the results were, we would get hanged anyway, ALL of us. I ran away from them when they said it was my turn to be hanged, luckily i managed to escape by opening a menu and selecting ""Go to home world"". That's when i woke up.

I wasn't able to control ANYTHING in the dream at all, except my own movement and at the end while running the menu which were the only things i could control/add. 

When i woke up, i felt like it actually happened and it wasn’t a dream at all. I was breathing in and out slowly through my mouth for the entire morning and it started to go back to breathing normally when it was turning noon/afternoon.

Does this dream mean anything? I've been wondering if it does ever since i woke up last Wednesday (18/01/2023).",1674119931.0
487,Dreams,conversation about masks,"it began with me having to use the washroom at a McDonald's. 

this particular one had tables right outside of the washroom, and when I was finished, for some reason I joined a table of two complete strangers at their table. 

the woman beside me was talking about how her children were playing in a gym today, with a bunch of other kids, and they were told they shouldn't be wearing masks. she felt that it was extremely inconsiderate of the teachers to discourage mask use as children are usually pretty careless when it comes to germs. 

her friend across the table agreed with what she said and shortly after they decided to leave. I didn't say a single word, all I did was listen to what she had to say. And then I got out of the booth so the woman beside me could leave. 

her friend across the table stayed there for a moment while the other left, and I told her that I respected the fact that she said that. not really because I agree with what she was saying, but just that she didn't try to change the subject or anything. she wasn't afraid to say how she felt even though she had no idea how I felt about any of this. it's a commendable thing to share your views honestly in the presence of a complete stranger. she agreed with me as well, and then the dream ended.",1674119382.0
488,Dreams,Why are my dreams so hyper realistic?,"It's not necessarily a recurring dream, but more of a dream where I am living a life that exists in a whole nother plane of existence.

These dreams are so real that I remember every detail, as if it actually happened while I was awake.

They're all different dreams, too. In one dream, I will be among my ""friends"" in my home state... or, at least, what seems to be my home state. 

I say this because all the memories are real, the locations are real, and everything leading up to the moment I am dreaming about is real. Yet, in my actual waking life, none of the things I've dreamt about have actually happened. I don't know those people. The scenery was never there. I've never seen these places. Yet, everything is real. 

Back to what I said about them being different dreams. I'm never in the same place in these dreams. Not even in the same plane of existence.

489,Dreams,I think i had my first ever lucid dream? And it was kinda hilarious!,"So a fact i feel is important to this dream, i do not like kids, never have, never will, and although i have found kids i ""like"" they still wear me down very, very quickly.

In my dream last night my family and i bought a house which once was a zoo that got closed down and renovated. As an aside, many times in life i have repeatedly dreamed of the same locations, just at different times/areas of it, and this house/zoo was in fact a zoo i have dreamt of many times before when it was a functioning zoo, so i instantly rcognised it.

At one point i wanted to use the toilet before heading off to bed, but instead i walked into a cubicle that had a large window on one side with 2 buttons at the front of it. Originally this was a ride in a lions den, one button made this large ""arm"" you are attached to spin you around this room and the more you held it down the faster you went, the second button spun your cart in circles.

I was having a great time using it, but once i was done i got out and discovered my family were watching me on the ride, because it seemed so fun they all wanted a turn. My aunts daughter was the first person to go on after me, but she's really young so when she used it she was going around really slow and kept stopping, it was excetionally boring to watch. But as people do with kids, my family were cheering her on saying she was doing so well and saying stuff like ""Wow! You're going so fast!""

Eventually i got bored and said ""I'm not standing here watching this."" and then i woke up! Like, instantly woke up after i said that! I have never done that before but it made me laugh almost instantly after waking up, like ""You people are boring me, this reality no longer exists. Bye.""",1674114950.0

Anyway in the dream supposedly I wake up, and I'm frantic. I turn on the light. Here's where it's a bit different each time. The first time I had this dream, I started looking on my bedroom floor, trying to find my hamster. Yes, my hamster, I have this dream where my hamster escapes, or that I forgot to put him back in his cage. Every time I realize that it was just a hallucination.. or something, and I groan, and go back to sleep. Last night it was me waking up, frantically going over to my desk (which is in my bedroom) looking for my hamster.. and realizing my hamster hadn't been left on my desk.

The problem is if this is a dream, or something I get up and do. And if there's a possibility I'm actually awake, why do I just get up and suddenly go searching for my hamster as if I forgot to put him back in his cage?? I just got him 2 months ago, if it helps.",1674110155.0

I really need to stop crying and get my day started ahaha.
Btw my sister is absolutely fine and I love her. It's just that she has grown up a lot and become an actual teen 😅 I can believe this shit. 

This might be related to two things
1- a terrible scare we had when she was a baby, where she had a fever and stopped breathing during nap time. I still remember my mother , a nurse, crying and screaming desperate. And my lil sis had her lips violet and the veins in her face (that was super fucking pale)where violet and visible too. Phew. I can  cry only remembering that day. luckily we realized she was in that state and nothing happened. She went back to being the playful chonker she was after some days in the hospital.

I often dream about disturbing things, the first one of those dreams I can recall was a long time ago, I remember losing my parents in an elevator, and not being able to return to that floor

I also have a fear of electric stairs, I remember as a kid falling down ellectric stairs, my entire family denies it ever happened but its a very lively memory in my mind


Another dream, this one was more recent, I dreamt I took part in a shootout, I am by no means a violent person, and dont have violent thoughts too often, I remember running away with a team, but the police found us, at that moment I pulled out my gun and shot myself, and woke up

I cant remember much about this one, but I just remember killing my father, on a dream of course

Another recent dream Ive had is of going to disneyland, and finding a vhs tape, when I played it it showed a kind of child, but with a very big head, and he had no hair, the sorroundings looked like sewers, and someone was coming to get him, when he finally got the child, the person who was coming to get him started beating the child very brutally, Im not a squeamish person, but even that got to me a bit, and thats all I remember

I also once dreamt about killing myself, it was a very hard thing to do in the dream, when I did it I ended up in space

I dreamt about spongebob torturing me, he put me in an electric cage and started beating me

And the final ones, even before the ukraine war had started I dreamnt about it, I dreamt I got send to Ukraine, as a soldier, and I shot some people, but thats it


Some more info about me that may help, I watch gore, but it isnt very often, I tend to worry too much at times, my relationship with my family isnt the best but again, I would not kill them, I have had suicidal thoughts, I only have friends online, and recently Ive had a very hard loss of a real life friend, they didnt die, but I found out they were just using me, and Im still attached to them.

I listen to music that can be classified as deppressing, or, ""emo""

''because you are the chosen one, you are the only one who can save the multiverse so please''. ''what about you?''. ''I can't come I'm sorry, you can do this you can stop this''. then he got killed right in front of my face as I see my only family member left to die.

I walked over to a manager and told them the task was too hard. He then took me into an elevator which usually means I was getting fired. We went into a room where there were a few people there including the managers mother. As I was explaining why the firing was unfair, his mother kept turning my responses around and making me look like the bad guy.

Afterwards I figured the job wasn't worth this harassment so I decided to let him fire me. He then proceeded to ask me to quit, in which I declined and told him he was going to have to let me go. We went on back and forth while walking up some stairs. Suddenly, the manager slipped down the stairs and got knocked out at the bottom. I started to hear everyone around me say that I pushed him which was not the case as I was very calm and figured to go help him up as a sign of goodwill.

I then saw spiders running up and down his face, so I kept my distance, then a creature wrapped its mandibles around him and took him underground.

Then I woke up.",1674103167.0

508,Dreams,I had a dream Prince Harry fucked me,So I had a dream that Prince Harry and I had sex in a pool. But I wasn’t actually myself I was Kate (or I was a maid idk). So Harry cheated on his wife with me and we were in this pool where I’m sure we knew people were watching and we were gonna get in trouble but we had sex anyways. When I woke up it felt so real that I had to Google if prince Harry cheated on his wife. I’m not even British and do not care much about the royal family but it was so weird??

509,Dreams,I dream that I can't properly use my legs,"I dream all the time, but a lot I notice they're dreams with a lot of stress.  There will be like a week at a time where I'll be in my dreams but randomly my legs will feel so weak like I can't use them, usually in my dreams I'll struggle to hold myself up and I always get embarrassed cuz it's in public but I'll just keep trying.  In those dreams I always feel like I can't get up and it frustrates me.  I had a dream the other night where I was with some friends, I went to get her bag for her but as I was walking back my legs did the thing.  I was trying to get up again but this time I just gave up and used my arms and like pulled myself along? It happened again later in the dream and I didn't try to get up again either.  I know this is weird and doesn't hold any significance to my life but it troubles me and I always wake up in a bad mood. 

I was thinking this could just be my actual body trying to move.  My dreams are always weird like that, I don't think I move in my sleep but I have a tendency to realize im in dreams or I'll be in very light sleep and unable to wake up while constantly slipping back in.  So my point is, is it possible these dreams have a meaning that I can sort out or is it just that my body gets confused and tries to really move, which causes dream me to fall when realizing I can't move my legs",1674101528.0

All the people were evil -- maybe even demonic. I knew two of the people in the first dream, one of whom reappeared in the subsequent dreams.

515,Dreams,how do you discern precognitive dreams from “regular” dreams? why do precognitive dreams seem so random?,"i’m sure that many in this sub have experienced at least one precognitive dream before, in which your dream revealed to you a setting, conversation or experience that later actualized in your waking life.

i have had at least 10 precognitive dreams in my lifetime, down to excruciating detail – but annoyingly, they are almost always pretty mundane, like someone saying an exact sentence in conversation, or passing through a place that i had never seen or been before and later realizing that i had dreamed of it already.

i suppose that there’s no way of knowing (while dreaming) that a dream is precognitive until it actually happens in your waking world – but i find myself getting frustrated at the fact that it’s always the most random, meaningless dreams that manifest, and not the more exciting, prosperous ones that i desire to experience.

i don’t know how to fully lucid dream. weirdly, though, i find that while i’m dreaming i seem to be able to make “conscious” choices as if i were awake – i just never arrive at the realization that i’m dreaming, so sometimes my choices feel a bit chaotic and the dream takes the wheel again.

does anyone have any thoughts on this? have you wrapped your head around precognitive dreams? how do you ask your higher self for more insightful dream experiences?",1674097523.0

521,Dreams,A double reality nightmare,"This may be kind of a long post but it’s a dream that freaked me the f out. 
For reference I’ll be using v1 and v2 as the two different realities I experienced.

I was living happily doing my thing and at some point my gf and I went out to the bar and I had some drinks. After which I came home and passed out.

When I woke up things were just a little bit different. I was still with my gf but I was in front of a house I didn’t recognize. I started feeling weird and walked inside to find her. I mentioned to her something that we had talked about the other day and she responded that she didn’t know what I was talking about. That I had probably just had to much to drink the night before and asked if I remembered going to the bar- which I did. 

Then she started showing me pictures on my phone of the friends we were with ‘last night’. People I didn’t know. We were hugging and drinking together and I had no idea who these people were. I started to freak out a little bit and went outside to catch some air.
I start looking through more photos on my phone. There were videos too. Videos that were all about me and my life. Things just didn’t add up. I owned a business in v2 (which I didn’t in v1) and I had heated arguments with people (employees?) in the video and I never remember being that kind of a person. I started panicking and went to up to the roof. I thought I had to be dreaming and that I needed to kms to wake back up. My gf stopped me and started crying. Begging me not to and that she didn’t know what I was talking about. We were happy together here - this was my life and I can’t end it randomly. She said that I was being crazy. She talked me out of it and I just couldn’t figure out what was going on. 

After that we went to her apartment (she and I live together in v1). I stepped out into the patio to look at the street below (1story directly above the entrance to the building). People were walking around and it was like New York kind of busy. I had this crushing feeling of defeat and confusion. I just kept watching those videos that seemed to explain my life.

Standing on the street I noticed a shadowy figure. No one else seemed to notice it- they were all going about their lives and were as vivid as could be but this figure was very blurry and not moving. It was standing near the wall of the appt building. It seemed to be staring at me. When I walked over to the edge of the patio and looked down at the figure, it slowly raised its hand and then blew a whistle. All of a sudden the doors behind me broke open and a black horse ran out onto the patio and started freaking out right in front of me. I tried to run but there was nowhere to go and I ended up getting kicked by the horse and I blacked out. 

I woke up again in my front yard (v1) and my gf sister was there riding a scooter around the street. I pulled my phone out and looked at it, I started going through my photos and I started seeing pictures of myself. Friends I knew and places I remembered. I was back. I started crying and my gf came up to me and asked what was wrong. I asked her if we could go upstairs and talk about it in her room. When we got there I had a break down. I told her about the whole experience and how scary it was to be a part of something I didn’t remember and how glad and happy I was to be back. I tried to pull out my phone as reference but when I did it didn’t open into my photos- instead it opened into a non discript social media and I started seeing the exact people and experiences I remembered. It was like a docuseries on the person I remembered becoming in the weird dream state I was in before. They were the exact videos my v2 gf had shown me to tell me who I was. I watched though it and my gf watched over my shoulder. I asked my gf and she said she had never heard of any of this or any of those people. It felt so weird because it felt like *I* was in those videos. It looked like me and sounded like me and I started crying again. It felt like the whole thing was some kind of social experiment. A prank. I had a feeling the blurry person on the street had set me up or done something but this was way beyond the type of thing any person could do. I felt like I was going crazy.

That’s when I woke up for real. I swear to god my first thought was that it was another layer in that story and it was one of the scariest feelings I’ve ever had.",1674093119.0
522,Dreams,parallel universes dream?,"Hi guys, This is Sofia. I am new here. (Actually I am new in reddit too)   
My first language isn't english, hope you guys can understand my poor english.

I can't search any informations related to my dreams,  so I tired to search that in different languages. If you have any ideas, its welcome to discuss! Thank you:)

First of all, I believed my dreams were related to parallel universes.

When I was young, I liked a guy very much. Start from that moment, he always appears in my dream. But yeah, if you like someone, they will appear in your dream of course, so I didn't mind at all. 

After that we were just friends, I moved on and of nothing happened. But he still appeared in my dreams for over 10 years. 

The dreams are always in a ""sad mood"". In those dreams, he always asked me to be with him, and asked me why I cant be with him, or he just disappeared in that world but only I remembered him etc. The feelings were so real and very emotional. 

But that wasn't the weird parts. 10 years passed. I even didn't know where is he or what is he doing. He didn't get any updates on facebook or social media. But he still appeared in my dreams.

About two year ago, I dreamed he was going to marry. Few days later, I saw he posted his wedding photos on facebook. I was like WTF? But still, I didn't think too much.

The next dream, he told me his wife is pregnant, but the child isn't his, because his wife cheated on him. And he asked me to be with him again and again. The next dream, he told me he was divorced.

Maybe you think I am just like this guy so much and can't moved on...

but few days ago, he hold his new born son and upload to facebook, I feel so weird and the think of the date he appeared in my dream.

Which means when he appeared in my dream and told me his wife pregnant. In real life, his wife was really pregnant. ONCE AGAIN, he dont update facebook or social media. His last updates were only ""wedding"" and ""new born son""

That why I believed those dreams were ""me"" and ""this guy"" in parallel universes....

do you guys have similar experiences? please tell me more if you know any! Thanks!",1674092903.0

524,Dreams,I got to see my succubus/spirit almost I guess.,"This being who keeps appearing irl and then in dreams to try and sleep with my when I'm in bed finally showed herself in one of my dreams.

I was in bed and thought it was like 6am, I then felt someone on my bed like usual only this time she slapped me on the chest and I vaguely saw the outline of a woman filled in what I could best be described as a mass of eye floaters that were see-through and moving. She had long messy hair and I could see a vague outline of underwear being shaped by said spirals and swirls. I remember no facial features aside from a nose and ears.

Like usual I didn't have my own will in the dream, and I was far from lucid, so my body acted out wanting her and reaching out to her. She just motioned that I needed to remove my covering. I fell back ion bed and woke up again. Still night I felt her on my bed but this time invisible, and she moved the covers on her own and proceeded to touch me.

I then woke up a third and last time, this time for real, and I knew because I fell asleep with the light on. Though I was confused since I awoke with the sound of my doorbell going off, so I was worried someone was actually at the door. I do have to mention that I was aroused when waking up that last time. So I still have no idea if she just shows up in dreams. I felt her presence plenty of times when awake.",1674091816.0

526,Dreams,My deceased Grandpa showed up again and I hugged a bunch of people I guess?,"My  dream started with watching a Sentai show called Chikyu Sentai  planetenger and the suits looked messy in a good way. Only saw two suits  though. The weird thing about that was that I was watching it on the  map part of a bus stop booth. The bus stop booth looked like a 90s one  with one of those painful blue benches. That said on the bench sat my  grandpa. He was wearing his old harlequin sweater from the 80s and a  grey coat. I think he had his garden shoes on, didn't really see his  lower half. He was at least wearing his old sunglasses. Before I could  react to this image he waved and disappeared in a particle pattern  starting from his head. Not shredded ash like in Avengers, more round  and bigger particles. He didn't smile or let me know he was happy. He  just said hi I guess.

Then I saw a  woman walk by, she had brown hair and a long green coat that looked to  be from the 40s. I hugged her and asked if she remembered me. I had a  sense she was family, probably an aunt, but she didn't respond, and my  dream then turned to two guys next to the bus stop. One guy was slav  squatting next to it. He looked British, like he's from Liverpool, I  walked past him to the other guy who was a talk man dressed in a hoodie  of a nondescript rock band. He had his hands in the pockets and was  clearly covering his whole body. Yet I felt this was Death, aka Magere  Hein. I greeted him and hugged him too. Then I turned to the other guy  and said I know you too, and he jokingly reached for my nuts making a  slur. Death reacted angrily to this and told him off. Then I woke up.

Still  not the strangest dream I had today. Earlier I awoke to a realistically  sounding door bell. and was actually questioning if it was real or not.  Luckily it was not as no mail comes in at 9am here. This is like the  5th time this happened these past few months.",1674091016.0

It's a Smithy and I ask the blacksmith there to make me a sword. At first he looked uninterested, lots of swords if that's what I wanted after all, but then I drew up the design. The sword's black handle has clock hands pointing out at the quarter hours and in-between them, large gem at the base with the insert shaped like an eye. I wanted more time symbols on the blade itself but he vetoed that out.

529,Dreams,My friend strange dreams about my friend who passed.,"It was the day of one of my best friends funeral. Unfortunately she had passed away in a car accident. I’ll call her B

I was hanging out with a different group of friends who didn’t know her casually before the funereal that day and was invited out to a water park a few hours away for a party. I had to decline due to my later commitments to attend B’s funeral. 

So I went to another friends place for a bit while I waited for my friend (we’ll call M) to pick me up as he was my ride to B’s funeral. I napped for awhile while there but woke in a panic in fear of missing it and I panicked to check my phone for the time and any texts from M. Turns out he was going to meet me here and walk with me to the location instead of driving, weird but okay. 

So I end up going outside and we start to walk to the location. Just casually talking to M I noticed something strange. I looked up in the sky to see what seemed to be a small ball of clouds far enough to where the moon should be in a bright sky. Then the clouds parted away (sorta like the hands on the moon in the film coralline near the end of the movie) and behind it I saw what seemed to be the earth. 

Confused and anxious feelings rushed through every inch of my being and I asked M if he could see what I’m seeing while I pointed to the earth like moon. He laughed as he said “see what?” almost as he knew something I didn’t. I kept asking him more panicked each time and then it got even weirder. 

The colour around us started to change almost as if a lens filter was put over the sun itself and the world almost seemed to melt around us in an array of colour and psychedelic patterning. I looked up at M once more and his eyes started to grow and bulge as of being manipulated by some sort of editing software and his smile growing up the sides of his face like the Cheshire Cat. He started directly at me and all he said was “welcome to the plane of reality”.


“What the fuck”
It was the first time I ever woke up from a dream and actually said something out loud, despite every dream I have being hyper realistic and indistinguishable from reality. This dream felt different though, it felt way to real to just be a dream. It haunted me for the next few hours and I just kept repeating the words “welcome to the plane of reality” and repeating my post awaking exclamation of “what the fuck” after each replay of the dream in my head. 

Thankfully I had to stop myself from thinking about it for awhile because I finished up getting reading and got the call that M had just arrived at my house to pick me up to head to B’s funeral.


This isn’t the only time B has effected my dreams either. She was a very spiritual person and our friends and her family often thought she was an empath of sorts. She always spoke about spirits and the way she believed they operate after death and so on. Weirdly enough she claimed she knew she was going to die in her early twenties, this hit me harder because I met her in her early twenties and she died 4 months after our meeting. 
I’m not sure if I believe in any of this stuff but she made me believe more due to the nature of her personality and her ability to just know things and walk amongst others as if she herself was a spirit. She was unique That’s for sure. So i say this because at her funeral I couldn’t cry, I’m not sure why but I just couldn’t do it even if I tried. I wanted to do bad but it wouldn’t happen and I felt a lot of guilt because of it cause all my friends and her family couldn’t stop crying. 

Days weeks and months go by and I hear the stories from everybody that B has visit them in their dreams and sometimes on multiple occasions. I was always know as the guy who had the crazy vivid reality blurring dreams and usually I dreamt about what was on my mind in a given day/night. Through that awful time without her I never saw her in a dream once not even a thought of her, it was bizarre to me. 

I believe it was close to a year and a bit after her death that it happened. Our group was all hanging out at our friends apartment like we usually did every single day for the 4 months we knew each other. And B was there this time. At one point she stood up and asked if I could come talk for a bit in another room, I followed and we sat down and since it’s been a few years since this happened I don’t remember if we talked about anything but , I do recall her telling me “hey , it’s been a long time since we’ve talked” and I think I woke up shortly after that. This really brought me comfort and honestly I don’t remember  if she’s popped up in a dream again but I really hope I get to see her again soon.",1674088947.0
530,Dreams,Pumpkin Dream,"Had a dream where I was in a big open field picking a huge pumpkin. It looked and smelled (how I perceived it anyway) ripe.

When I opened it, its flesh resembled a regular pumpkin, but the seeds were blue and while marbles and beads. They were smooth, very shiny, and in super pretty patterns (below is a pic of similar patterns). Then I was joined by a few people, some of whom I knew, asking for the marbles, which I started to distribute to them.

532,Dreams,False awakening type 2,"I have had a tendency to have false awakening type 2 if I fall asleep during the day, which is why I never take naps anymore. However, last night I had the most creepy false awakening dream I have ever had.

I woke up in a bedroom in my grandparents cabin and I walked out to find my grandpa reading in the living room. I instantly realised this was a dream because the man did not look like my grandpa, but he was wearing the same clothes. I proceeded to ask where my grandma was, as she’s very sick I taught it would be good to speak to her in a dream. Unfortunately he told me she was not there anymore, and then I proceeded to screw up.

I said that I would love to talk to her as this is my dream. I don’t know if this is because my subconscious have heard that you should never say in a dream that you are dreaming, or because there is some scientific reason behind it but my grandpa looked very angry. He ensured me that I was NOT dreaming. This is where I asked if this was like a parallel universe. He smiled creepy at me before I replied “almost”.
I then lost the ability to say anything and my dream re-started. I woke up in the same bedroom in their cabin, but this time I was glued to my bed. I tried to wake up and tried to move my arm or leg to wake myself up in real life, but the only thing it causes was a delayed or slow movements in my dream where it was a struggle just to move a centimetre.

Into the bedroom 5 mannequins of various height wales in. They all were super scary and without any face. Just a blank head.
This is where I started panicking and really tried to wake up. I tried to scream but my tongue was still glued to the top of my mouth. I tried to force myself to sit up in my bed, and barely opened my eyes, but it was like something pushed me back into my bed and the same nightmare repeated again.

Every time l tried to wake up, it was like I was super tired and automatically fell back into the same dream where these mannequins were standing around my bed looking at me trying to escape them.

Anyway, if anyone have any tips of how to wake up from dreams please let me know I am scared to go back to sleep now.",1674085240.0
533,Dreams,Shark Fight (maybe NSFW?),"First post here, but I’ve been feeling the need to share this one, since I found it pretty hilarious. 
(I LD quite often, and this past month it’s been every single night). 


About two nights ago, I had a dream where I was on a beach in Belize with my family and there were red flag warnings, like for dangerous currents and marine life. Obviously, being me, I went for a nice little swim. Suddenly, a great white shark came up to me and went for my legs, I kicked it right on the top of its head and it swam away, or so I thought. 
I went a little above the water to grab my book and my towel for a little read with my feet in the water, and this idiot of a shark made the mistake of snagging my favorite beach towel and one of my best books. This made me so so mad. 
I dove right back into the water and it was, like, about five feet away from me, floating still in the water, like we were in a western standoff or something. It came right at me at supersonic speed, and I just starting beating the absolute crap out of this shark. It kept swimming away, but in a way that it turns back around in a split second just to charge back at me and attempt to attack a different limb/body area every time. 
It had my book in its mouth like it was taunting me. This made me sooooo mad, so in the end I said f it, and just grabbed it from behind and held it till it couldn’t move anymore and I guess snapped it’s spine? 
I got my book and beach towel back, but they were both ruined :( 
I have that towel and book irl, so when I woke up I was happy to see and know that they were both a okay. I’ve never been in a shark attack, but honestly, I feel like I’m pretty ready now if it were to happen to me haha.

534,Dreams,Current disturbing dreams,"I wanted to share my recent dreams in case anyone can explain to me why these dreams may be occurring as I have been finding them increasingly disturbing.

The first one was a dream in which I found out that my mother had been in an accident and passed away, when I found out I started to sob uncontrollably then I woke up. 

But then the second dream left me feeling very weird for days, I was in a city with friends that have no resemblance to my real life friends. We entered this city and there was a green metal frame very high in the air. I saw that one of my ""friends"" was walking on this frame very carelessly and my heart sank, he then fell off the frame and landed right in front of me. I'll spare the details of what the body looked like but it was incredibly graphic. I then started to sob again as I sat in the ambulance staring at his lifeless mangled body.

535,Dreams,red cardinals and red hibiscus flowers,"Looking through the basement sliding door,  I see a red cardinal on the patio. I open the door inviting it in,  but then thought I probably shouldn't let a wild bird inside.  The bird really want to come in so I opened it again,  but closed it. 

I went upstairs.  The bird feeder, which is on the deck,  was full and the was a lot of red cardinals.  The hibiscus plants were outside and they had more red flowers than I've ever seen. I went out on the deck,  where my mom was also.  One of the red cardinals was particularly interested in my mom.  I thought of bringing out some of my plants on the deck since the hibiscuses were out,  but I became worried that there would be another frost.

I headed back inside and walked through a spider web. I warned my mom about the spider web.  I told her that the web was splattered,  since it was not weaved neatly as spiders normally do. None of the web actually got on me,  which I found interesting. The end. 

I see a lot of cardinals at my bird feeder,  and my hibiscuses are inside since it is cold. One of them is a little confused and has a flower right now.",1674081440.0

This is my first post here, so I'm hope you will enjoy it, and maybe can even help to encode the meaning ( if there is one ).

So I've been having dreams of birds landing on my hand. First time it was a kingfisher landing on my finger, and then slowly morphing into a cat, that was sleeping in my arms. The second night a larger, yellow bird landed on my hand again. The background setting is different, but there is a nice story to the dreams, where the birds don't really mean anything.

540,Dreams,Nightmares about my narcissistic/emotionally abusive ex.,"We broke up back on January 6th. But before that, he cheated on me with 6 people (that I know of) and emotionally tormented me for months. We lived together and I slowly became a shell of my former self. Nothing I did was ever good enough. He’d treat me like absolute dogshit and never apologize. One time, during an argument, he said “I’ll kill you”, but he never once hit me. He didn’t have to. The psychological abuse was enough. 

I keep having recurring nightmares about him either cheating on me or trying to kill me, sometimes both. The ones where he’s trying to kill me are worse. In those, he’ll follow me around, taunting me and yelling at me, sometimes holding a knife. Sometimes I’ll try to kill him before he can kill me. But the actual murder is never shown. The whole dream is about the chase. 

I feel like I might have some form of cPTSD from that relationship. I’m not sure. I don’t know what to do or what it means, but I want the dreams to stop. I’m tired of waking up crying. I haven’t done that since I was a child with an ‘overactive imagination’.",1674078884.0

2. Also mirrors help to teleport me or wake up, but I have to focus a lot. 

3. The famous dark entities that follow you when you are more conscious about your dreams (when you know you are dreaming and can control your dreams) 
I discovered a way to get rid of them but it is a large note. If someone is interested in this specific topic I would like to know. 

4. Excitement, when I am really exited or happy or horny inside a dream, it really makes me want to pee hahaha
I am learning to control it but it is very difficult sometimes and I end up waking up.

550,Dreams,"Pack of Wolves - 1 black, 1 white, 1 grey - having trouble interpreting meaning behind the dream","Hello, r/dreams!

A couple of nights ago, I had a dream that has been bothering me, especially since I have never had a dream like it.

I was walking through a forest on a beautiful sunny day and as I walked along the trail, I witnessed a pack of wolves: one black, one white, and one grey(if I recall, the white one was leading the pack). Upon seeing them, I immediately began to run, however, I noticed that I didn't run as fast as I do in real life(perhaps though that is dream physics messing with my perception or another symbol with meaning), and I had no idea if they had saw me and began to chase after me - something was up either way and I could feel the fear building up within my dream self. All of a sudden, the dream cuts forward to me having suddenly befriended these wolves: I am petting them, walking along the trail with them, talking to them like they're family. Fast forward again to nighttime and as the vehicle I'm in drives past the entrance to the forest, the wolves are coming out: like a reminder that they are always there with me, every step of the way.

It is such a confusing dream that I believe holds meaning yet I can't place my finger on what that meaning may be. To clarify: before I went to sleep and had the dream, I had gotten in a sudden argument with a friend over something so petty and insignificant, and I talked to her like crap, that I feel I may have permanently damaged our friendship. It didn't help too that leading up to this, my anger was boiling up over several issues that fuel that anger and I never once tried to control it. I am living in deep regret and shame over this. I am the kind of person who always puts themself down and hides their darker side(shadow); I am the kind of person that tries to remain moral and 'pure'; I am the kind of person that tries to see all sides to an argument, refuses to pick sides, and is also very distrustful. From my reading on the symbolism of the different colours of wolves in dreams, I suppose it's trying to show me all of my different sides and me unifying and bringing those sides together and living in harmony with them.

I haven't found any information online about befriending the wolves you see in your dreams.

I would absolutely love it if you guys could help me interpret this dream for it would bring me great peace of mind! I apologise if I may not have shared enough information in the post as I don't want to share too much.

Thank you!",1674070209.0

565,Dreams,It finally happened.,"So, I've always heard anecdotes on Reddit, TikTok, and other forums that say, ""Never tell anyone in your dream that you know you're dreaming.""


I never believed them, until today.


Not too long ago, I was asleep and I was having a dream about work. I was aware that I was asleep because now and again I would have a dream where I would float in the air as if gravity doesn't affect me. The only thing stopping me from flying into space is that I'm usually in a building, so the ceiling always stops me.


This building happened to be the store I work at.


After a few minutes of chatting with my coworkers, I got bored with the whole floating-in-the-air thing, so I asked one of them for help. Only then did they notice me, laughed it off, and asked me, ""is this a common occurrence?"" To which I replied, ""Only when I'm dreaming,"" and they laughed again. 


They stopped helping me down and instead let me go, to which my body started to float inside the store. The customers inside were no longer shopping, but rather standing at both entrances with the sliding doors, their silhouette grayed out, but it was clear they were staring directly at me. As I floated past them, inside the store, which now had all the lights turned off; the entrance was only dimly lit by the sunlight outside. Meanwhile, everyone stood still - continuing to look at me without saying a word. 


All except this one girl. 


She was walking next to me as I floated by her, her head down towards her cart. She wasn't walking fast, but she also wasn't moving slowly - just keeping pace with me. Yet, she refused to show me her face, though her hair made me think of someone I hadn't seen in years since I graduated high school.


Eventually, I felt myself getting heavy and I knew I was about to wake up. Every time I try to control my dreams and spawn something in, my body gets heavy and it automatically wakes me up. 


Except for this time, I wasn't alone. On my bed, was the same girl that refused to look at me. She was just sitting on my bed, looking away. I tried to reach out and touch her, but my arm was moving slowly as if time had slowed down. She turned around and smiled at me with this creepy look, and then quickly turned back around. That happened three times until I was about to touch her, then my entire body reset - my arms now back to my side and she was this time laying on her stomach, her head in her arms as she cried. Before I could do anything to move again, I blinked and she was gone. My body had jolted itself awake, and it was over.


I won't lie, it wasn't scary since I was aware she was a hallucination of my sleep paralysis, but now I kind of want to do it again. I'm curious if she would appear again or if it would be someone new. The sun has just gone up and my room is dimly lit, just like how it was in my dream, which means that my brain was using that as a reference.

In the dream, im in a dark building with a female that had red and black hair and no piercings. I know very descriptive. Please be patient. 

I was in this female ""house"" where she lived with her mom, I think. The first thing i remember is im sitting on a couch and she tells me she is going to take a shower so i get up and leave the home and head to some kind of public bathing place but it starts to rain so i run back to the home and i decide to get into the shower. She is already out of the shower but decides to get back in saying, ""we are taking too many showers."" So i quickly start to wash mysel,  and her ""mom"" is saying something to he,  but ican'tt clearly remembe,lr,  but after i get out of the shower i decide to try and be entertained. She is a digital artist, and im not sure what kind of game she made, but i remember it being a dark theme and almost like a platformer. Im playing her game, and I ask her, ""Have you ever beaten your own game? "" she replies ""no"" so i set the game down, and I gave her a kiss. We kiss 4 times in total, but on the last kiss, I tell her ""okay this is the last one,"" and then i instantly wake up. The really weird part is that i felt such intense love twords her . I've never even felt this kind of love, even to my own family. That's what's bothering me the most.  I literally felt like I'd give up the world for her.

But about 15-ish minutes ago I had a dream/nightmare about some how drowning in an almost empty jail. It started off with me sitting on a bench in a small cage like area, kind of kaddy corner to me there was a table. This cage like room was pretty much open on all sides, though one wall lead to a laundry room. A staircase wrapped around one of the corners and on top of the laundry room. In front of this cage there was a small watching booth tho the wall facing me had no glass. Everything else is a bit fuzzy. It has just been Christmas and apparently I had no where else to go so I decided to stay the night in a jail, in the dream I had been here before so it felt homey (I have never gone to prison or even seen one irl so I'm unsure where I got this from) but I was picking at my leg hairs with tweezers, there was music playing over the loud speakers but it was the same line and beat over and over, something like ""a big ol' door in a parking lot"" or ""a big ol' boar 'n a ball of snot"" my first thought was it sounds like a Gorillaz song. Like beat and tempo. Anyway I suddenly get the little air bubbles in my nose like you can when diving in a pool. It took me a bit to realize hey you need to breathe. I freak out and somehow get out of the cell/cage, I blow out the air I was holding and spin in a circle like I'm in space, the air bubbles still sitting there like time froze. I start looking around and all I see are dismembered body parts of inmates just floating? I go over to the little booth and there was a gal in there but she had died in a gruesome way. I get out and just stand in front of this building. I can still hear the same lyrics being sung over and over, gravity is back to normal and I can breathe again.

It gets kinda blotchy but once i realized it wasnt my room its like i fell back asleep. The moment it hit me that it was a dream i managed to get up and turn the light on but i had 3 light switches and the lights were majorly dim. I only have one switch and use Alexa for my lights. (I actually used the biting my cheek trick lol) I kept waking up in the same room and it felt so real every time. Each time i would start to look for my phone or vape only to struggle and when i found my phone it was dead. I also woke up one of the times hearing actual music i listen to and had my headphones in. The case was broken and i laid there and fiddled with it. The scary part was it was incredibly hard to move. Especially after i knew it was a dream. Like when i tried to sit up i weighed tons and i couldn't vocalize at all. I couldn't really raise my arms either.  I kept trying to wake myself up and yell for my partner but nothing. I kept trying to wake myself up but couldn't. I kept trying to hit my face but i couldn't. I did wake up properly once but immediately  fell back asleep. A couple things i remember before i ""woke up"" was laying with my partner and it felt like hands grabbed my feet and hanging out with him. Also scratching at the window by the bed, and neighbors having ans argument with lots of thumps etc.

What the heck was that? How can i make sure it never happens again?",1674041106.0
576,Dreams,I had a dream my dad died of a heart attack,"Everything felt real, and my dad is extremely healthy and fit so it was crazy that I could possibly dream that.

I actually felt like what I would feel if it were to happen and it’s crazy because in most of my dreams my emotions are suppressed as if I know it’s just a dream but this one was different.

586,Dreams,I think we go somewhere else when we dream.,"I don’t know if this happens to anyone else but as long as I can remember I have definitely had dreams in alternate realities or something of the sort. For example, I will have dreams of secret rooms containing all the furniture of my childhood home but I couldn’t take any of it, or someone’s house being relatively similar in real life but different in the dream, or my childhood room being different, or my backyard being a series of cliffs over water that was indoors??, or my university being completely indoors, or my childhood best friend having an extra brother. The common theme is “the same but different.” It seems like I have things or experiences that resemble mine on earth but are different. It’s really trippy to wake up and reflect on all this but I dream vivid dreams nearly every night now and it has been increasing lately and is certainly freaking me out. 


Note: I also lucid dream, have gotten stuck in lucid dreams, can touch people and feel myself vibrating, get sleep paralysis regularly since a child, can reverse my lucid dreams with my mind and replay a scene and the characters in my dream do not know I did that. Can anyone else relate? I feel like I have a very niche relationship to the dream world and want to make sure I’m safe.

I know my way around the streets there and it feels normal when i’m in the dream. there’s a park in it and i know the way to walk to get places. there are even some places in this realm that i went to years ago. there is also an unsettling amount of malls in it all of which i know my way around. i go into the same stores sometimes and they are stores that don’t even exists in real life. it even expands further than just the city i live in too. there’s an interstate interchange that is very difficult to navigate and if you go the wrong way you end up at the airport which happens to me often. I also know my way on the country highways out side of the city and can even recognize certain exits and over passes. one of the highways goes through this small town that i also travel to some times. there is a fast food restaurant that i visit a lot there but it has been closed the past few times i’ve gone. the town has an upper and lower level and a curving road that goes around each part. there’s a plant store that i visit often as well on the outskirts of that town. not only is there just the local area of my dream world, but there are also national parks in the dream world too that i visit and know my way around.

594,Dreams,Having dreams of people getting killed while I'm not doing anything for my own safety,"For the past two days, I've been having very disturbing dreams. These dreams usually occur when something has disturbed my sleep in the morning and I'm trying to sleep again. This has happened two times in a row now, and this is the pattern I've noticed. I didn't do anything after the first dream because I thought that it was a casual nightmare because I don't see/remember dreams most of the time. But this happened again just now.

1. For the first dream, I vaguely remember Me and my mom riding a bike with a driver and he was driving too fast and as a result my mom was feeling uncomfortable and she was on the edge of the seat. I confronted him to drive slow and he took out his rifle. After this I remember me and my mom on a bike running away while he's chasing us and shooting everyone who's trying to stop them

2. For the second dream, I remember being in my school class and there was a new student (Let's call him X) I couldn't remember. He had something precious, I don't remember exactly but think of it as a precious pen or a geometry box. My friend tossed his thing to me and asked me to break it. I asked X if I should break it and he got furious and snatched his thing. Next thing I remember, the teacher has his thing and told him that she'll keep it until the class is over because he was disturbing the class. He started hitting her and trying to get his thing back on which the teacher asked other students to call the principal. As soon as he heard this, he took out a blade snd couple of other small weapons from his pants, the place where guns are usually kept and started slitting necks of all the students in the class. As soon as he took his weapons out, he slit the stundent sitting in front of him, then the student next to him and so on. At one point, he was guarding the gate so no one could leave the class and whoever was trying to leave, he was slitting their necks. I asked my friend that we both should team up and hit him and take the blade away from him but we didn't do anything. After this, I kind of realized I was dreaming and none of this is real. Next thing I remember I have escaped the class, uninjured and I was on the ground floor. This is the area where we had the vice principal's office and I told her what was going on in the class. I remember her being worried and sending someone up to our class. Next thing I remember, I'm going upstairs to my class and I find out that other kids have been giving him info of other students for money, they all had blue chits of paper in hand and one of them was talking about how he needed money so his girl could participate in the dance competition. As soon as I try to take a peek in my class, I see my friend who originally tossed me X's thing in blood, X was still slitting the blade across his body and he was in so much blood it was unreal. He was dead but he was still being cut. Next thing I remember, I'm in the class to get my belongings and there were some girls in the class. The classroom had papers marked with the evidence and some of his powers. To frame this better, think of a crime scene full of papers describing the evidence. On the papers, his different abilities were written. His professional use of blade, him being able to block multiple attacks and a lot of other things I'm not able to remember. Next thing I remember I'm on the ground floor and the vice principal is searching for X. He was still in school but no one knew where. After sometime, we saw two students coming downstairs either in blood or something else but the vuce principal was very distracted by them. After this, X magically appears next to me in the crowd, I recognise him and he's trying to run away. Next thing I remember is I'm on the exit, I see him coming towards meto exit the school, I hold his arm but I was afraid so I didn't hold it very strongly and shook it off and left. But before running away, he came back to slit my forehead but I don't remember seeing any blood coming out of me. After he has run away, we all find out that this was all a set up by the principal to make the school popular in news and stuff. She told all of us that it was all fake blood and everything was set up but it didn't feel like it. She then hails him as a hero who has brought nothing but popularity to the school. The school was all over news and the principal's assistant kept telling her names of news channels this was being aired on.

That's the end of it.

After I woke up and hopped on reddit to see if there are other people who have gone through this and I find out about u/radowl and this community.

595,Dreams,Why Do I Obsess Over My Nightmares and Want Them to Get Worse?,"I’m at a loss with my nightmares. I just don’t know what to think, feel, or do anymore. I don’t know exactly what I’m looking for in this post, but I'd love to hear any advice, understanding, theories, etc.

I’ve been having nightmares every, single night for the past 8 years, but I don’t want to get rid of them. Nightmares are pretty much the only things I feel good about in my life. They are also the only things that matter to me. I just finished school and am looking for a job, but that feels so pointless in comparison to my nightmares. My nightmares are way more terrifying and dangerous than everything in real life, but they still feel so much better than real life.

Also, all of my nightmares feel 100% real, and each dream I have lasts for about a month in “dream time” (the way I perceive time in the dream). So every time I wake up, I am pulled away from an entirely different life I was experiencing for a month or more. That is one of the most jarring, most painful feelings I’ve ever experienced.

I don’t know why I prefer nightmares to real life, especially since my only goal in my nightmares is to avoid dying to the thing(s) hunting me. Maybe I like that life in my nightmares is governed by one simple goal. Maybe I like that I am more capable than in real life. (I’m always more scared, though.) Whatever the reason is, I always want to go back.

Real life feels so pointless nowadays. I don't care about finding a job, paying taxes, interacting with real people, etc. when my nightmares are waiting for me. It’s always a grind just to get through the day now. All I want to do is sleep and stay sleeping so my nightmare never ends. (I know how this sounds. I’m not going to kill myself or anything, though. That’d be nice and all, but I could never do that to my family.)

The worst part for me is that my nightmares are slowly becoming less terrifying. I don’t mean that I’m getting tougher. I mean that the “antagonists” are less intimidating and that the danger level is drastically reduced. I utterly despise that. (I also feel like a wuss in real life because of how “tame” my nightmares are now.) I truly miss the dreams where I experienced more pain and fear than I could even begin to describe. I can still remember the ones that made me seek out a counselor in the first place. I remember how horrific they were, but now, I wish I could go back to having them again.

I don’t know what my deal is. I don’t know why I’m obssessing over this. I just want to go back to the old nightmares. As weird as that sounds, it’s true.",1674018539.0

There's a pond with a tree next to it, and there's a big branch that stretches out over the water. On that branch is a baby/toddler. Like 18 months or so? 

The baby topples into the water and it seems like no one else noticed. I don't know what to say so I run and jump in the water. This baby sank like a stone, so I had to dive deep. I got a hold of the baby and I started to swim toward the surface. I was about to break the surface, when the water level seems to rise another several feet. I kick harder, I'm almost there and my lungs are going to burst. The water level rises again. I kick harder and every time, before I can surface for air, the water level rises. We never make it out of the water.

That's usually where it ends. One time, I woke up entangled in my blankets. I was holding my breath until I got my head uncovered. I fought out of the blankets and took a huge gasp for air and had to catch my breath.

In the dream, i have a fish tank. It’s around the size of a king sized bed, but it’s only around 1 1/2 feet deep. The water is rim level, like it’s about to spill. And the fish are of different colors, and mostly small, like they’ve j hatched. But some are distinctly blue and bigger. The tank is pretty, and full, like something you’d see at a water park.

I get a cup and try to scoop some water out to prevent the tank from overflowing. But I cant do so because, for every scoop, there’s always a tiny fish. I still keep trying but I think this causes panic among my fish and some start jumping out of the tank. I call someone to help me put them back in, but unfortunately, there were a few casualties - maybe 3 small fish. The rest we were able to put back in but I want to check up on them. 

I get this dive suit out of nowhere and start wearing it. To my surprise, the tank had a ladder and I slowly dip myself down the tank. It was bigger than I expected, deeper, and the fish, they weren’t small. Most of them were the size of my hand! A blue fish kept circling at me, like it was my friend.

607,Dreams,Can someone help me connect this lucid dream.,"Dream: 
This is only a section of the dream, the only section that burned in my mind. In this section it started off with my mom calling, I was talking to her on the phone… in the dream I’m aware that she has passed, so she sounds different and she explained that she was “sick” and I said like “I though heaven is a place where you can’t get sick” she said it wasn’t the same, more like she was changing… I said “like reincarnation?” And she confirmed that yeah maybe as an animal or my child… the topic changed she had been explained to me that her and my Ex let’s call him Davis for now… had picked out a necklace for me. It was at Kay Jewelers, so I went to the mall, and looked up at this man and said “hey I’m here to pick up a necklace” my mom said it was under a specific name so I gave them the name… he had said “oh it’s not here it’s actually being picked right now” I looked behind him and there was Davis… and he looked at me forever, his eyes wide open and he was walking towards me, I wasn’t expecting to see him so my heart dropped… I was so scared of him. My mom had assured that she had been around Davis that she was helping him showing him his way back to me. She had been guiding him I guess. This necklace he spent a pretty penny on, cause I could see the price in the computer it had my name on it right next to it it said “for my monster” but like in a way where I drive him crazy but in a silly way, it was a beautiful necklace it was blue and green… it was his way of saying he wanted me and he chose me…. He was sorry…. He didn’t want to get a ring yet but he knew he wanted to spend the rest of his life with me. I’m pretty shocked and lost and confused because I felt like I wasn’t worth it. I had texted this person who was helping me with some relationship things and said “guess who I am next to” she had told me not to talk to him but there he was next to me… I was so happy and it ended with us sitting somewhere holding hands… but it was forever… it was going to be for forever… he knew after being separated from me that he could never live without me… and that he would marry me, we would have kids… in the dream he walked in front of me… which for me was a sign that he was taking the lead, I was the leader originally but he was confident and knew what he wanted and so he was leading us, holding my hand, in front of me…. It was raining…. I could see everything so clearly. And that was the section I woke up and felt it.

I should preface…
Last night I was in tears in complete tears heart broken, we had been broken up for 2 months and I looked at his photo and I said… “I should let you go…shouldn’t I… I feel like I’m fight for you but maybe you don’t want me… your so beautiful and deserve so much, any girl would be lucky to have you but maybe I should say goodbye and not hold on to you anymore. I miss you so much, your voice, your smile, your eyes… I wish I could hug you. I wish you could be here with me… I really wish you were here.”  Literally fucking heart broken and feeling my heart sink…. He was family to me. He had sworn to me it was over and told himself he would never ever get back with me. Felt at this point I should accept it. Then after I talked to my mom… “mom is this the right thing to do… is this what I should be doing should I walk away?” Crying my eyes out. I tried to meditate after but I was truly sad… and decided to go to sleep.  

Message: I’m not sure what the message was, but I felt like it was a sign that it wasn’t over, that he was afraid to lose me, the necklace as a symbol of his undying love and wanting me to not give up on him… my mom telling me that she’s been guiding him towards me, his fear of losing me was stronger than walking away from me.

615,Dreams,My sister and I have the same recurring dream and sometimes on the same night,"I've have quite a few recurring dreams but there is one that I recently found out my sister also shares. 

I'll get to the dream in a minute, but for an overview, both of us have the same overarching theme to our dream and some elements are exactly the same, whilst others are completely different so I'll try and highlights these as clearly as I can while I describe it. 

Identical elements: 

* We are both alone in our dream - she is not in mine, I am not in hers, no one else is there. 
* We both find a secret room in our grandparents holiday home. This home is in another state and we have gone there since we were children. 
* The secret room always has a spa bath. 
* The dream is never scary, more explorative. 
* We both don't know we are in the dream until we wake up (not lucid) 

My experience / dream:

In the dream, I am always the age I am at the time of dreaming it. I always enter through the house and the house is as it is in reality, totally normal and i'm usually just wondering through and I always feel sort of lost but excited while im walking through it, like I know i'm on the brink of discovering something, but I also know that what im about to find is out of the ordinary and has never been there before. 

The entrance to this secret room always changes, sometimes its a really long floating platform, kind of like something out of mario kart, and other times its through a dining room behind a sliding door. 

The secret room itself also changes, but the element of the spa bath being from and centre is always the same. Sometimes the secret room is in what looks like a fairy forest, the walls are covered in a beautiful moss and flowers and leaves, other times the secret room is a huge giant Moroccan style Riad / tiled pool (half of my family is from morocco so im not sure if this plays into it or its just a coincidence in terms of style preference). 

&amp;#x200B;

Once I've found the room I sort of just start looking through everything, the draws, the cupboards, looking through the mirrors. I never find anything and nothing ever actually happens beyond finding the room. I also can't remember ever leaving the room, I usually just wake up at some stage during my exploration. 

&amp;#x200B;

We have absolutely no idea what this dream could mean and even more so why we are both experiencing the same dream - we're assuming the spa bath as some sort of significance since its one of the only constants in the dream, but just though I'd put it out there to see if anyone has any ideas.",1673998618.0

617,Dreams,Going nuts at the sky-high playground with a wolf problem [lucid dream],"This dream was a couple of days ago, but I didn't find it in me to write it down until now.

It is my first lucid dream of this year, and, with a bit of shame, I must say it brought out my, shall we say, wild side. The *smashes expensive vase to the ground* ""god that felt good!"" kind of side.

-----

I was walking down the street not far from my home, when I saw a bus station that was very out of place.

It was constructed right across a local dentist on a pedestrian walkway with no ability for cars (or busses) to enter.

What was even stranger, is that I knew there was a bus stop 2 minutes away from where I was standing. 

""Why did they make another?"", I asked out loud.

""That's what we've been asking ourselves too!"", I heard from behind. A random passerby looked straight past me at the bus stop with an expression of disgust.

The brief silence was broken: ""We protested against it, but they didn't listen"".

Seconds after I turned around to look at the stranger, I heard the sound of an engine slowing down, and turning around once more, there now was a bus at the stop!

The bus itself was completely different from normal busses around here - it was smaller, had more round corners and had a different paint job.

Inside were a group of children, one adult lady (I assume the teacher) and a male driver in the front.

I got in, and, with an available seat somewhere near the front in sight, I awkwardly mixed myself between the yelling children, and nobody seemed to mind.

The doors closed, and the bus drove off. It didn't take long before we reached our destination.

Even though I counted the bus only making 2 left turns in what felt like minutes, we still ended up at a place that was beyond recognition to me.

There was a gigantic mountain, with an escalator that was extremely long, easily as tall as a large apartment complex.

Once we got out the bus, the teacher went to a small wooden hut where she got a stack of papers.

I noticed there were electric gates where you had to scan a QR code, so they'd open, allowing access to the escalator. 

The teacher proceeded to give everyone a paper, which turned out to be the tickets with the QR codes on them.

Surprisingly, she didn't just give the kids a ticket, but me as well. Did she think I was part of their group?

The silent atmosphere started to fill up with bleeping noises as all kids stormed through the gates they opened. There were 3 gates and 2 escalators, one going up and one going down.

After I scanned my ticket, the long wait to go to the top began.

During this time, I mostly looked around as the world below me became smaller and smaller.

As the views of the top of the mountain became apparent, I noticed we were heading towards a giant playground.

There were at least 100 things to climb on, to crawl under, and so on. Wooden houses, swings and a couple of other things you'd typically find at a playground I don't know the English words for dominated the field, with a more dense forest in the back where kids were also playing.

On the right side was a small shop that seemed to sell candy, food and snacks.

Suddenly, I heard growling together with screaming, my gaze quickly turned to face the direction of the sound and what I saw was bloody, and hardcore: A gray wolf was eating a child.

Its maw was ripping of skin of the kid's arm and chewed on the muscles it tore with it while it continued ruthlessly, unaware if its meal was dead or still alive. Nothing stopped it from eating the kid.

Once it was done eating, the fur covered in blood, it looked at me, baring its teeth, and I knew I was next.

It jumped right at me, but I quickly managed to dodge the attack, and grabbed its, head, punched it a few times with my other hand, and smacked it into the ground, forcing an audible puppy scream out of the wolf.

I continued to punch the head again and again, the puppy screams started to fade, and only after the sounds completely faded, I stopped. The wolf was dead.

Now a dead body laying on the grass, I got up, and scoffed, saying: ""I didn't do this to save the kids, you shouldn't have come after me.""

I walked inside the building with the snacks. It was a small shop with a kitchen and a register.

On the register's counter stood a container with large lollipops in them, and I decided I wanted one.

But there was a big line, and it was moving slowly, and it was here my annoyance got to a boiling point, especially since I just got rid of that wolf.

I walked to the kitchen, which had a number of self-service elements to it - you grab a plate, you put the things you want on it, and you pay.

There was one female cook making a pan of soup. **Here my lucidity starts**. I grinned and grabbed a bunch of toothpicks, and threw them straight in the soup pan!

While all of them floated, the cook as clearly not happy: ""Hey! Where's that good for!"", she yelled at me.

""Oh, sorry, but this makes it more tasty!"", I screamed happily as I went full psycho in my own world, skipping in line and grabbing the lollipop.

It tasted super sweet but with nice flavors, it was one of those circular rainbow lollipops. Once outside, I started to doubt whether I should go back and get even more candy. It's not like I can grow fat here or anything!

In the end, I decided against the idea, and instead felt in the pockets of my jacket, assuming there were hand grenades in there.

My hand felt something that seemed like a grenade, once grabbed I ran into the playground (which now was completely void of any children thank God, otherwise it'd be even more psycho) and put one grenade on a wooden climbing thing.

It immediately exploded and fell flat to the ground. I laughed, cheered and yelled. I did another, and another, and another. Eventually, the entire playground was just a field of sand.

The last thing I did before waking up, was saying out loud: ""Oh my god I needed this! It felt so good!"".",1673997906.0

620,Dreams,Dream Interpretation,"Hey there! So I had a really interesting dream this morning and I’m not sure what it means, but I have a feeling that it’s related to Dionysus or perhaps some other deity.

I am a very active/lucid dreamer and I have had very questionable themes and messages come across that really freak me the fuck out sometimes. I think I astral project sometimes too, for I revisit certain places a lot and I remember them. But in all my dream journeys I never call anyone by their names, or have anyone tell me their names out loud. If I see someone I recognize (whether it’s a relative, a friend, or a celebrity) I notice them and I think to myself (in the dream) “Oh this so and so from blah blah blah” I always just KNOW who I’m interacting with but I never say “Hey so and so, come here” or anything like that. Also no one ever says my name. 

So I woke up at like 5 this morning and fell back asleep until I had to get up at 7:50ish. So the last dream I had I was in a really fancy house, watching a movie with someone. I am paying close attention to the character in the movie, kind of narrating, making comments, and asking questions about the plot (like annoying people do when they watch movies) suddenly the dream setting changes and the young man that was in the movie is right in front of me, almost as if I was no longer watching the movie but I was now in the movie. He’s laying down in all white blankets and I’m sitting on the ground next to him. He tells me his name is Dion/Deon (Not only did he say this but I remember seeing it at some point too) and that his dad is a King of something, I’m not sure what and he’s kind of complaining/whining about the expectations his father puts on him and how he wishes he could just be free. This makes sense because when I was watching the movie he was about to paint his nails and I turned to my friend and said something like “His parents are going to get mad at him for doing that.” 

I listen to him rant and I consoled him and he asked me to play with his hair, so I start to do that but he says I’m doing it the wrong way. Eventually I do it right and he relaxes, and we kind of just cuddle and embrace for a while. But I knew that it was about time for me to wake up at this point. I tell him that I have to go but that I don’t want to leave, that I’ll miss him. He held me close and says he doesn’t want me to go either, and then I woke up.

As soon as I opened my eyes my only thought was “DION DION DION” like I could not forget his name even if I tried, for this is the first time someone told me their name in a dream. And when I was talking to him I said it too like “Listen Dion……”

I wrote in my dream journal first thing “Dreamt of Deon/Dion” because it was so bizarre to me.

Does anyone have any insight to this?
Thanks if you read this far.

625,Dreams,dream about…. posting to this subreddit,"so in my dream last night, i woke up and laid in bed with my mobile scrolling through stuff, and i came across a post on this subreddit asking about lucid dreams. so i commented

*i have this strange brain condition with lucid dreaming (where i’m technically lucid but my brain still doesn’t ”realize” it’s a dream) which results in stuff like the dream being incredibly clear and my actions being reasonable, but not into the realm of the typical “i know this is a dream, i will go summon a chair” thing*

i didnt actually get to comment it before i woke up because i was spending like ten minutes rewording the message (i could read the exact words, this was close i could remember to the ‘last draft’ of it - i’d just decided that the parentheses were too much when i woke up (ironic))

and, well… my dreams ARE surprisingly reasonable most of the time, without ever dipping into true lucidity, but as far as i’m aware ”half lucidity” isnt a defined thing like that, and i dont think i have any brain problems :?

628,Dreams,Teeth falling out,I’m currently 24/m. I’ve been having this dream in different variations since I was little. I can remember waking up in a crying panic thinking all my teeth were gone since I was little. As I’ve gotten older and tend to self medicate (not related to dreams or sleeping) my dreams are harder to remember.  Onto the dream: recently I remember I was talking to a loved one in my dream and I noticed one of my bottom teeth was loose. I started to move it around with my tongue and it fell right out into my mouth. I panicked and ran to the nearest mirror. I started wiggling teeth with my hands and they were falling out left and right. I ran out of the bathroom and to my horror my teeth just started crumbling out of my mouth. Like I said earlier it’s always the same premise with slightly different scenarios. I’ve done some Google searches and I’m not convinced it’s because I have a deep imbedded fear of “losing something”. Anybody have anything similar or know what it could mean? Out of all my nightmares I would say it’s the most realistic and I wake up genuinely thinking my teeth are gone.,1673994126.0

630,Dreams,"New to dreaming, please help.","Hello, I am new to this subreddit and also new to dreaming. 

 Since the age of 14 I had been smoking weed on a regular basis up until about 3 weeks ago (now 26 years old) to travel abroad in a country where all drugs are illegal. To my knowledge it isn't uncommon for stoners to lack in the dream department, something I felt like I was never missing out on really. 

It wasn't until a week into the trip that I noticed I've been starting to dream again. I used to dream as a child about cute kittens and playing at recess from what I remember but I find the dreams I've been having now are far from that. They've been eerie and daunting. For the most part I've found it easy to forget about the dreams I've been having because I don't have the best memory. That was up until this morning when I woke up crying because I had a dream that my twin sister died. 

 The dream starts with me visiting our home country. Her and I are sitting in the back passenger seat of vehicle I don't recognize. The dream doesn't show me a drive, just that we are sitting there talking. The dream shifts from that scene to one where I am now sitting in a classroom with our few similar friends. It's seems to be a singing class with a conductor at the front of the room. The conductor is having everyone try a new vocal scale that nobody can figure out. Eventually I am the only one who was able to nail the vocal scale. With congratulations all around everybody begins to ask the where abouts of my sister. 
 The dream transitions again to a dark road, ahead there is a railway crossing with its arms coming down, and as the red lights flashs you can hear the *ding ding, ding ding* of the warning call that a train is approaching. I see a big white SUV (my sister drives the same vehicle) hurtling ahead trying to race the arms to cross the tracks before the train corsses and suddenly *CRASH* the train collides with the SUV and pieces are flying everywhere. 
 The dream again transitions back to myself in the back of the same vehicle from the beginning of the dream and I am with my sister again. I now know of the accident and am shaken up and confused. I ask her if she had died and she said yes, she did. Confused on how she was still in the car with me she had told me she didn't want to leave me and she had wanted me to be the one to tell her son that she had passed away. 

 At this point I wake up crying because I couldn't ever fathom the thought of losing my sister. 
 I'm really struggling to see the meaning behind this dream. I am now scared and sad and I miss not being able to dream. Please somebody let me know that this isn't a sign that my sister might die suddenly.",1673993696.0

Tw cheating,suicide 

Basically I was cheating on my boyfriend with some guy. (I have never cheated irl) The sex was good. Like so good. So in my dream me and this guy started like a thing. We were talking about how we might see each other together etc. I felt really bad hiding it from my bf but the sex was too good to pass up. So my side piece came over to my house randomly. Idk why I guess cause he wanted to see me. It was just so random. So I start telling him like yo you gotta go my boyfriend is coming like tf why are you here. Idk what he said but he had all his stuff. His ps4 his clothes like he was spending the night. It was weird. So he seduces me and says he can be fast and then leave fast. I go okay. So we do the deed and we’re rushing. He’s not working fast enough so I tell him come on. He runs up the stairs with his stuff to leave and bam by boyfriend walks in. It was eerie how similar they looked. I swear it looked it could’ve been my bf brother. I make excuses oh that’s just my friends but he’s obviously mad. So I run downstairs and say oh it’s just a friend and he doesn’t believe me. He then tells me oh look at your mom and sister (who I live with) that’s how I know. He’s not super mad just sad and it’s made me feel like shit. So I go out to drink to cope and my family came with me. My sister is judging me saying oh I did that to my current boyfriend that’s so shitty of you to do you should be honest we all know what you were doing. Mind you they didn’t they didn’t have proof. I got so mad I called my family a bunch of whores. I felt bad but was just so mad. The bartender called me crazy but I yelled back he was a bitch. I started crying and for some reason was only wearing a blanket as a dress and I had to hold it to not show anything. I was so drunk I tried to delete my side pieces texts but couldn’t. Then I see a text from my bf asking if my “friend” took two of his games. I was so depressed at that point I tried jumping in front of a car but no one hit me. 

That’s all I remember but I’m shaken up. I hate dreams where I do things I would never do in real life. The guilt is still there in the morning even when I’ve done nothing to hurt anyone.

636,Dreams,Hello kitty house," 

I had a dream last night where I was a kid again, sitting in the back of my parent's car heading down a long road, at the end of this road there was a short, stone, deteriorated sign with hello kitty on it and beyond that a stone rubbled building, half of it on fire with a very wide entrance; inside filled with bodies of women, almost crucified but on a wooden plank instead of a cross, outside of the building it was the same, surrounded by these naked bodies, some of them flayed open. I am usually very desensitized to gore but I cannot explain how terrifying this scene was. Upon seeing this my parents started screaming and quickly turned around hoping I had not seen it.

After that my dream cut to posts? from the person who created said scene, destroying old and irreplaceable things. And then some type of huge creature in the woods, and then I woke up.

I can't remember all of the details from this dream but I remember waking up horrified with a sense of impending doom.

Sorry for the bad grammar and all, I just really wanted to get this out. Am I crazy to think this could be a real location? I remember it having a very specific address but I can't recall anything other than it being in Cali? Feel free to weigh in on this- Why would I dream this?",1673991030.0

Dream 1: 
I supposedly wake up from a dream INSIDE a dream 1

Then i find out that im still in a dream so i try to wake myself up but its hard, kinda feels like im suffocating

Dream 2:
After i wake myself up from dream 1 it seems like im actually awake, like vividly im in school when im supposed to still be sleeping. I even share my experiences wth my friends in this dream

after that i find out again im still dreaming so i try to wake myself up but it feels much harder, it feels like if i let go im gonna have a heart attack.

Then Guy Fieri shows up and says “cousin!, I’ve missed you”, and gives me the biggest most loving hug.

We drove up to this stoic white building with metal stairs, and there was a door we both walked thru. Inside it was this weird machine with gadgets and buttons, and next to that as another door. My mom and I immediately started pushing buttons trying to figure out the right coordinates. My mom says, “I think we found it, we’re here.” She opened the door and we were somewhere in space in this galaxy (like some portal). We both stared in awe, “this is it”, “it’s beautiful”. Then I woke up.",1673987790.0
641,Dreams,I need some advice,"I have always struggled with recurring nightmares, have gotten used to them at this point. In most of the dreams, I realise that I'm in a dream and force myself to wake up by ending my life (mostly by jumping off my homes terrace). It always worked, up until recently. For instance, I had a really creepy nightmare today, I don't remember it but I know it was horrifying. Of course I knew it's a dream, I remember that I was trying to escape it by killing myself somehow, but it just wouldn't work. I tried and tried but to no avail. Eventually, for what felt like an eternity, I woke up. I screamed pretty loud and it woke my family up as well. So in short, now I'm trapped inside those god awful nightmares and I don't know what to do....",1673986590.0
642,Dreams,The storm.,"The other night I had a dream I was living near the ocean, I was with two older ladies (I think one of them was my mom). I remember we were out back talking then we felt a shift in the sky, it was overcast and we could tell a terrible storm was on the way. I started going around the house shutting these protective window shudders, and I stared seeing neighboring families rushing and loading their cars to leave. I went  to the back where the ladies were talking, and I told them we should leave it doesn’t look good. One of the ladies said, “No, not quite yet. We will leave when it’s time.” I got upset because I felt the anxiety rise in my belly, as I run to the front of the house to get a view of the storm. I felt this warm beautiful breeze gush in against my skin, and it felt amazing. There was this black car following me, and rubbing up against my legs. I gave it pets and love, and then woke up.",1673986325.0

646,Dreams,The Moonman has been Haunting my Dreams for over five years!,"So, recently, I(M23) have started keeping track of my 'Weird Dreams' by writing them down as soon as I wake up, because why not?

This reoccurring dream(nightmare) has been very constant(Should have reoccurred 50+ times over 5 years) yet I can only remember very few details about it. I am sharing what I remembered and wrote down from this morning's dream.

So, it's evening time(7ish I guess, the Sun has just set and I know it should get dark in 15 minutes) and I am in some kind of a field where there's dark greens around me. I look around and there are Bats flying and the sound of them flipping their wings is eerie already, suddenly I see 'Bear Grills' there and he tells me it's okay, they are all going to the Moonman. He points in a direction and says, ""Look to the South"". I sure do look in that direction and the Moon is Full, right at the Horizon, 'Reddish White'. He says South from here is where the Moonman lives and it's the perfect time for him. Puzzled, I grabbed my Sniper Rifle from my back(I really don't know where I got it from), and zoomed in towards the Moon, after little adjustments, I could see him, the Moonman, standing on top of a Cliff(Or Mountain) but the angle was so perfect that his upper body blocked the centre of the Moon and I could see the moon's sides. He was a Tall Handsome Brownish Complexion guy with Long flowing hair and a clean shaven face.

As soon as I saw him, he smirked and fired something towards me, literally in a split second as if he was waiting for my eye contact. It sure hit me, right in the forehead and I was falling down to the ground. While I was falling(In Slow-Motion), my brain played the vocals of the song 'Goodbye Moonmen' (Rick and Morty version) and I hit the ground.

I woke up with a Jolt after 'dying in the Dream'.

Note: I am sure that I have seen the exact picture of this Moonman in real life, over some Movie's or Game's cover picture but I just can't find it.",1673984755.0
647,Dreams,Daily Nightmares that lasted until I was about 9.,"I want to see if there is anybody else that has been in this same situation or maybe I was just a mentally fucked child. If I remeber correcly I probably became a bit more concious and about two or three years old. So I believe once I was about three that I started having daily nightmares some with reaccuring characters. One of them was Popeye the Sailor man, and the other was almost a mix of Rosalina from Super Mario Galaxy and Jimmy Neutron. One of the my most memorable dreams I had when I was most likely eight or nine years old already at that time. So basically it started off with my mom and dad going out for the evening to dinner or something like that, and they left me a babysitter. Well this babysitter was the giant psycho that liked to throw me hundreds of feet in the air (different dream). Well my parents left and we coexisted for the first part I think she even let me play my Wii for like a second. But once it got dark I saw two little kids outside of the window that looked like they were from the kids book ""Where the Wild Things Are"", they ran by the window fast so I did'nt really get a good look at them. But the giant woman made me go to bed, but I guess I knew she was going to attack me while I slept. So I dashed out of the house and the woman would chase me, I ran to the backyard and I saw the two children in their weird animal pajamas holding torches and standing besides a chopped tree, I just paused and was even more freaked out by them. Then, the woman grabbed me and tied me to the stump of the tree. I believe than the two children, one a boy, the other a girl in their damn pajamas took up their axes and both swung down on me, obviously after I died I woke up, I did feel an imagined impact from those axes, but right after I die in a dream I wake up. Basically I am wondering if anyone else has had reaccuring characters in their nightmares during early childhood who would always try and physically harm them?",1673983923.0
648,Dreams,The most horrifying “lucid” dream I’ve ever had,"I’m at the hockey rink where I work. I’m doing my job, I remember telling people not to use the vending machine as it doesn’t work, etc, but slowly realizing that I’m in a dream as the work day goes on. This part is hazy and hard to remember, but is very insignificant compared to the rest. 

All of a sudden, I’m in a room at the rink that I’ve never been in before. It doesn’t actually exist in real life, but it’s certainly in the rink in my dream, as it has the exact same flooring and walls. I can look out a window in the door to the room and see the ice. In the corner of the room is a staircase with a metal door, one that opens up from the floor, similar to what you’d see on a bunker or cellar staircase. I remember knowing that I have to go into the bunker, and that I’ll be safe down there. 

I close the door behind me and walk down the concrete stairs. The bunker is very small, no bigger than about 10 feet wide and 8 feet long, but there’s 4 doors, one on each wall, all with exit signs. I approach the first door, a smaller one across from the stair case. I don’t even try to open it, for some reason I know that it isn’t really an exit, and the door won’t take me to where I want to be. 

I go to another door, a small one right under the staircase. Same thing, I don’t try to open it, I don’t even touch it. I go to a 3rd door, a large double door, it’s on the back wall, very close to the door under the stairs. Once again, I don’t try the door, I don’t think it will lead to a good place. I feel like there’s something outside the bunker waiting for me, but I don’t know what it is. 

I know I want to leave the bunker, and start to feel a bit anxious. I’m uncomfortable there, I don’t like it, but I know none of the doors lead to where I want to be, and I can’t go back to where I came from. I reach my hand out to touch one of the bunker walls, and while my real body is not moving, as I’m asleep, I can still physically feel my arm reaching and my hand moving both in the dream and in real life. I touch the wall and immediately feel the cold, hard, but smooth concrete. I can even feel the little holes and bumps, imperfections in the concrete. The texture feels so real, as if I’m actually touching the wall. Even awake now, I can’t replicate that feeling. 

This sends me into a panic, I’m extremely uncomfortable, I have to wake up, I have to leave the bunker, I have to stop dreaming. Whatever was outside waiting for me now feels like it’s inside the bunker with me, chasing me. I begin to sprint towards the final door, a large double door on the front wall, the first one I saw when I entered the bunker. Unfortunately, I’m sprinting in slow motion, like a slo Mo running scene from a movie, but time is passing normally. Once again, despite my body being asleep and not moving, I can feel myself running, my arms and legs pumping, both in the dream and in real life.

In my dream I begin screaming as loud as I can while trying to run to the door. “HELP! I WANT TO WAKE UP! WAKE UP!” My running slows even more, and I begin to travel less distance with each stride, to the point where it almost feels as if I’m running in the same spot. I begin to see my real self sleeping, my body laying there. For some reason, I can see and feel what position I’m sleeping in, what part of the bed I’m laying on. 

I start to flash back and forth between my dream self and my real self. While my dream self is running for the door, everything is completely black for my real self. I can physically feel my body laying in bed. I can feel myself trying to open my eyes and wake up, but I physically can’t. It’s almost as if I was completely conscious and aware, but unable to wake myself up, unable to move, speak, or do anything, like being in a vegetative state. I remember somehow knowing that I was in bed alone. My girlfriend was there beside me when I’d fallen asleep, but I somehow knew that she’d gotten up and left the bedroom. I remember praying that she’d come back and wake me up, or at least keep my real body company while I try to find a way out. 

I snap back to my dream self, I’m almost at the door. It feels like it took minutes to get across the 8ft long bunker. Once again, I don’t try to open the door, I don’t even touch it, I just know that this is the door that I need to go to. As I take my final stride before the door, everything goes black. My eyes open, I’m awake, back in the real world, but confused, dazed and terrified for a minute or two, like I haven’t fully woken up yet. My girlfriend opens the door and walks back into the room, snapping me completely out of it, bringing me back to reality. 

I told her about the dream in full detail, how terrifying it was, how I knew I was dreaming, how I could control some things, but not everything, and how helpless that made me feel. I’ve dreamt almost every night since I was a young child, I remember a lot of my dreams, but they’re hazy and foggy, I forget details and can’t describe everything. This one felt completely real. I’ve never experienced such a vivid dream, I’ve never experienced texture in a dream, or a connection between myself in the dream and in real life. I’ve never physically felt my body’s movement in a dream either. I remember every little detail. 

I’ve had lucid dreams before, where I’m in full control and can do as I please, so they’ve always been enjoyable. This one was certainly lucid, I was aware that I was dreaming and could manipulate some aspects of the dream, but I lacked the full control that I usually have, and felt like I was on autopilot, desperately fighting for control. It felt like I was losing my physical self and needed to get back into my body. 

I’m so confused by what this dream means, and why this happened. Was I dying? Did I make a connection with something or somewhere else? I suffered a concussion a week ago, and haven’t been sleeping well/struggling with symptoms, and had a mental break down the night before. Did that cause this dream? Am I going insane? This dream has genuinely terrified me, I don’t want to go back to sleep again.",1673983666.0

Everything's fine until my father decides to drive off a cliff. Instead of panicking though and falling to our death, we gracefully float down onto the end of the fall and land perfectly without being harmed. I've had this dream numerous times throughout my life ending in the same way. I'm 23 now, when he passed away I was 21. The night he passed away I had this dream again for one last time. My dad isn't driving in this one, instead it is my wife. She drives off the same cliff and we both panic in this dream. It's terrifying it's real and we slam on the ground. The cars ruined but we were all fine, me my wife and my son in the backseat. I ask my wife ""are you okay? Are we okay?"" And she responds with ""ya I think so."" I woke up that morning, it was around 7 am I would guess so. I immediately go onto Facebook and see my auntie makes a posts confirming he passed away that night. I woke up my wife feeling just emptiness inside. It didn't hit me yet. I tell her ""Jimmie passed away."" She cried before I did.

654,Dreams,Dreamt of being a mass shooter... any ideas?,"Preface: I dreamt this when I was a young child, maybe 10-13, I was an adult in the dream

The gist is that I dreamt I was a mass shooter, I was carrying an AK-47 to a building that looked like a high school, but had college/adult aged people, and I must've murdered about 20-25 people...

The dream ended when I finished the run, went outside to the front of the building, looked up onto the roof of this 3-story building, and saw someone.

I just stared at them, watched the panic in their eyes as they realized, they proceeded to jump off the roof onto the concrete sidewalk in font of me, impacting the ground... accurately, and woke myself up with my own-self disgust.

I was a passenger in my own body, verbally fighting back and rejecting what was happening with my thoughts, with no actual control over my body.

662,Dreams,Almost Killed By A Demon In A Candle," This has probably been the most terrifying dream I’ve had. It started normally. I was working the till to the gas station I work at, but my friend and his mom were there. My friend was mad at his mom because she was getting even more strict and everything she walked past and heard him talking about it to me she threatened to punish him. 

My dream swaps to an office like building where someone I live with works at the bottom floor. I walk through the hall to get to her office and with the way her desk is set up, her back would be facing the door. I was with my friend again and we were talking and sorting candy at the desk. Then I went upstairs to where me and the other girl lived. She was already in bed when I came up. She seemed really out of it. I go into the living room and something starts talking to me and saying today is my last night alive. The voice seemed to be in surround sound and everywhere, so at first I didn’t know where it was from.  I figured out that it was coming from a red and green gingerbread painting on the wall near the dining room table. When I saw it, I marched over and ripped it off, but the red and green of the picture was imprinted on the wall. Then the voice says the next time I see the candle, they will kill me. I remembered upstairs in my bathroom, there was a white candle. I imagined myself looking into the candle and I was terrified for the rest of the night. I tried to tell my roommate while she was in bed and brushed it aside and told me to go away. I needed to sleep but I didn’t want to with the threat and the candle. So I went into my room and debated whether to avoid the bathroom at all costs, or to just get it over with. I decided to get it over with. I went in and looked directly inside the candle. Loud noises all around me start happening, the loudest noises coming from the bathroom. I run backwards from the bathroom as my vision darkens the edges. I start hyperventilating, then I calm my breathing and glare. I couldn’t tell what was coming for me through the black smoke and tears, but I knew it was coming closer and closer and it was huge. 

Then my alarm woke me up, thank God. It was really weird and I've never had a dream that has gotten me that scared.",1673973192.0

666,Dreams,Just had one of the strangest nightmares in my life yesterday,"It's my first time here, so hi. :v

I'm a writer and have always had a very good imagination and storytelling skills. Combining that with the fact that I never shied away from horrors, you can guess that I've had my share of either bizarre or scary dreams. Last night, however, it was something else, and I just wanted to share it because of how bizarre I felt when I woke up suddenly when it abruptly ended around 3AM.

In the dream, I remember I was somehow brought to a weird, dark house, where I was then placed in a small room that acted as my cell. Everything was dark and dirty, and there was this unmistakable aura of despair. That's the best I can describe it.

I wasn't alone - that became pretty apparent very quickly. There were weird noises coming from within the house that resembled odd creaking, as if something plastic walked around the house in a weird, non-human manner.

Soon I met two of the house's inhabitants. They were two women, or so I thought at first. In truth, they were very human-like puppets, moving on their own and trying to act ""normal"". Still, there was something scary about the way the moved, as if there was someone else controlling them. There was some sort of outside intelligence that either controlled them or just occasionally spoke. They had snow-white plastic skin, with faces that were eerily human. The strangest thing was they didn't seem to harm me, and they seemed responsible for keeping me alive albeit still imprisoned. They fed me although I can't recall with what, and I ate, occasionally having to endure their unnerving presence in my room., as if making sure I didn't spit out anything or vomit. They never caused me any harm, but at the back of my head I somehow always knew that they were perfectly capable of ending my life with no effort at all. They walked around the room, ocasionally talking to me as if we were friends. There was no one else to converse with, so I eventually started actually responding and day by day I started to see that there was an odd gentleness in these creatures that were my captors.

Unfortunately, they weren't the only inhabitants of the house.

Every once in a while I had to endure what I called The Mother. It was a puppet, just like its ""daughters"", but while their presence went from being scary, to unnerving, to just slightly uncomfortable, The Mother was terrifying to the point of making me mad and afraid to open my eyes. A larger puppet, with parts embedded in its head that looked like almost devil-like horns, two pairs of hands wih razor-sharp, plastic claws, and the unmistakable evil presense behind black eyes. There was not a single benevolent thing about that creature, as it tormented me both physically and mentally. For whatever reason, it seemed hell-bent on keeping me alive despite relentless tortures I couldn't recall when I woke up.

As time passed, I seemed to grow accustomed to the two ""daughters"", who at a certain point began to even comfort me after my ""sessions"" with The Mother. They seemed to really care about me and my condition. I remember even growing closer to them, essentially befriending them. No matter how good our relationship was, they never stood against The Mother. I seem to remember that there were sounds coming from outside when I was alone, which made me feel like The Mother and them did talk, although I couldn't tell about what.

I remember one day waking up and realizing that the door to the room was left open. I hesitated for a very, very long time, afraid of The Mother being right behind that door, waiting for my act of defiance. Still, I did eventually leave the door and then stood in a long, roughly 4-meters wide corridor, with only a few doors visible, seemingly leading to rooms very similar to the one where I lived. At the end of the corridor there was a large, iron door with a glass window. The glass was so dirty with either blood, human excrement or something I couldn't even name that you could barely make out what was in that one room. I barely saw some silhouette, like a large man, or a woman, sitting motionless on a chair in the middle. By large, I mean, unnaturally fat, as t something grew on them.

The next thing I remember is that I returned to my room and fell asleep.

The final act of the dream was just so bizarre. I remember waking up to find my room's door open, again. This time, however, upon walking out of my cell, one of the doors in the corridor was open as well, and next to it, one of the ""daughter"" puppets, standing motionless, waiting for god knows what. I approached the door first, seeing stairs that led up to what felt like freedom. I didn't, however, immediately run away. I then turned to the puppet and said that I wouldn't tell anyone about what I've been through there. I seemed to have fallen in love, I think, with one of the ""daughters"". The last thing I remember was feeling the unmistakable presence of The Mother right behind me, emanating pure evil and hatred. As I stood paralyzed by fear, she slowly wrapped her weird, mishapen arms around me like a huge snake slowly getting ready to choke a victim to death. This is when I die, I remember thinking, but then the Daughter spoke.

""No, not this one""

Anyway, that was when I woke up, I think. I can't remember anything else about the dream, but I do remember laying in bed shocked at what the hell did my mind conjure up. The only thing that has just come to my mind that can explain why I dreamt about such things is that a week or two ago I did wonder about what kind of horror film I would want to make if given a chance.

670,Dreams,Had a detailed dream about a Robin Williams movie that doesn't exist,"Had a dream about a Robin Williams movie that doesn't exist so detailed I even remember the name

I dreamed I was a kid watching TV with my family, it was playing a Robin Williams movie called ""The Off Nanny""

It was a horror/comedy movie in which Robin Williams played a babysitter but he's actually a monster. However, he wasn't actually evil, but the movie constantly played with the thought of ""oh shit, he might actually kill these kids"" just to pull the rug from under us and show him doing some regular nanny stuff. I assume the ""Off Nanny"" was because there was something ""off about the nanny"", I know, my subcounscious is very clever.

It had this ""old style"" to it so it looked it was an 80's/90's movie.

It was about he taking care of three kids, a teenager older sister, a kid little brother and a baby sister. Their parents never show up, I don't even remember them being mentioned honestly.

The older sister was the one with the most screen time by far, at the start she's the only one who notices something wrong with their nanny and keeps probing around to try and prove that she isn't human (Robin Williams ""human form"" is an elderly gentle lady)

The movie also didn't try to hide it from the audience at all, many times Robin Williams eyes would turn like that of a snake and a long, bifurcated tongue would come out of his mouth so we'd know for sure he wasn't human. The character even introduced himself with the last name ""Off"", I remember that because the little brother would constantly call Robin ""Off Nanny"".

A ""cute scene"" I remember was Robin Williams taking care of the baby sister, he was playing with her on the couch then suddenly his eyes changed and the tongue came out so you'd think ""oh no, he's gonna eat her"" but turns out he was just making faces at her.

I even remember one of the ""tense scenes"" where the older sister was nagging him about something and suddenly Robin Williams looks at the camera (his back is turned to the older sister) and he shows his ""true face"", some reptilian shit. And you think ""oh crap, now she's done it"" only for him to turn around and act friendly once again.

There was also a cop character that the sister tries to get to investigate the nanny, but he doesn't take her seriously untill the end of the movie

The end of the movie is kinda hazy, I remember the sister and the cop somehow managed to uncover him, but the little brother still didn't believe and then some supernatural/alien shit started happening with bright lights and stuff flying around Poltergeist style and Robin Williams had to save them. I don't really remember what was causing it, if it was the monster unintentionaly or something else, but at the end of the scene Robin Williams says to the older sister that she was right, it was too dangerous for him to be around them.

The farewell scene is Robin Williams in his human form getting ice cream with the older sister, little brother and the police officer (don't ask me where the baby sister went, I guess my dream forgot about her) and they talk about future plans that I don't remember and Robin drives off in a car while it shows the cop and the children going back to their daily lifes.

I swear I actually woke up thinking the movie existed only to then remember ""Holy shit, it doesn't"" and I had just made up an entire Robin Williams movie in my head while I was sleeping.",1673967330.0

672,Dreams,I keep having very dark dreams....,"An example, today I had a dream my wife and I were being chased by droudekas - start wars Droid with a shield generator and they roll around. We decided we were going to go ice fishing when this happened. We went onto the ice because we knew for some reason their shields wouldn't work on ice. Then after going on the ice I rushed them and started choking them to death (lol choking a robot...) and they turned into honey badgers. Started getting really aggressive with me so I choked harder to kill them. Then they turned into cats. I feccin love cats. But in my mind I still had to choke them to death. They were struggling to breathe, and then they began to slowly become more and more lifeless. It was a slow process. It took 5 minutes until they finally died... 

It was absolutely awful. 

I keep having dreams where I have to kill something. Cats, dogs, gerbils, honey badgers, robots.... its disturbing. And I hate it. I don't know how to change it. I'm constantly killing things that I love. Aside from the robots...

676,Dreams,Ancient Alien City Akumar,"I had a dream last year where I was me but not me. Like I was in the body of myself but not me. (Similar to Dr. Strange 2.) I was standing on some platform with my cousin and someone else and I happen to look skyward thinking I’ll see a regular plane flying low. What I saw was this strange flying craft that was rectangular in shape but in the center was a circular structure. As this thing flew overhead I freaked out and started to squat down away from it; which caused my cousin to look at me strangely, and ask why are you reacting this way. I got the feeling I shouldn’t react that way cause it shouldn’t be abnormal. 

The dream shifts and I’m still with my cousin and one other person, and we are standing on a hill overlooking a city. A city I have never in my life have seen. We were watching this towering monolith with and a weird tentacle-like creature merged with it, come floating down to the ground. This amazed me and as I survey more of the city I see other giant tentacle-like creature monoliths that are moving and shuffling around in the city. These things were huge. This city made our skyscrapers in out biggest metropolitan cities look tiny. I don’t know if I asked what the city was called, but I think, my cousin said it is called Akumar. Now I don’t know if that’s how it’s spelt or not. It could be Aku’Mar or Akummar. I have no idea.

677,Dreams,Help me decode this weird dream.,"So i m with my parents in some sort of public cabin with 2 other groups. One is a group of 2-3 girls and the other is a couple. Now everything is normal, when something about this guy of the couple irks the girls, they have some kind of argument but it leads to nothing. After a while my dad notices something and then we have discussion where in we get to the conclusion that the guy abuses his wife/ girl. Its kind of obvious because i can marks on her neck and all. My parents subtly ask the girl if anything is wrong, she says all is well. Maybe the guy got a whiff about all this and wants to leave all of a sudden. My mom wants to confront him but i plead her out of it because i feel this guy could be dangerous, maybe he has a gun. I also remember convincing another guy about not confronting(but i dont remember who, he is not my dad, i dont have siblings). And finally he leaves and i am explaining my mom why i did not want her to confront that guy when i finally wake.

678,Dreams,I keep having excruciatingly painful dreams and I don’t know what to do.,"I am an adult man, and have had sleep paralysis regularly in the past, but over the last year or so, I keep having dreams that seem like sleep paralysis, but are very painful.

Sometimes I’m ‘awake’ in paralysis in my room, other times it’s more of a lucid dream in a dream environment.

Sensations are usually my body being crushed or torn into. I try to scream or flail, but I can’t do anything about it. Most of the time this ends up cycling into me thinking I woke up, but I am still dreaming. It is usually pretty cyclical.

It is 50/50 whether it will be some sort of entity that I can’t see, but can feel in a paralysis state, or something I can see coming in the dream.

I always wake up still in physical pain. I don’t have pain on a regular basis during the day from anything.

I used to have a recurring dream when I was little that I got punched in the stomach by a baby doll, which always resulted in me waking up in a lot of pain for a few seconds.

Does anyone experience this or have any ways I could make this happen less often?",1673962645.0
679,Dreams,My first lucid dream.,"Before going to sleep, I drank a Peppermint-Mugwort tea and vaped like 15 puffs (2% nic salt). Then I watched some ASMR on my phone and fell asleep.

The dream starts in my bed, while my dad is standing at my door. I thought he woke me up for some reason. Now I take my phone, watch TikTok and walk towards my dad. He was angry for some reason, said something and closed the door. While watching TikTok I wanted to return to my bed. After a few more TikToks i realise, that the way from the door to my bed is way shorter and that I should've been at the bed already. I look up from my phone, when suddenly I'm outside, in my pyjama. I am confused, but start walking back to my house. Half way I think to myself ""Wait what? This can't be real"" and I start to think I'm dreaming. I do the reality checks, like counting my fingers, etc. I get really happy. I've been trying to lucid dream ever since I first heard of it. Now I walk back to my house and think what to do now. Then I thought to myself, if this is a lucid dream, I should be able to do ANYTHING. So I grabbed my dads guitar, and started playing Smells like Teen Spirit, as if I was Kurt Cobain myself (I can't play the guitar irl). Then I started thinking about all the things I could do, when I heard a door open and my dad talking, as if he was trying to wake me up. I blink, open my eyes, and there I am: in my bed, with my dad waking me up. Now I thought I was awake again, but no. I now just stood up, did what I always do and again. I blinked and was in my bed. This time, my father was not there. I did everything like usual and soon realised I did actually wake up.

This was such a weird experience, and I will definetly try to recreate this. Maybe anyone here has some more tips on lucid dreaming?",1673961485.0
680,Dreams,"Dream about ""the virus"" that startled me straight awake because it really scared me","So, multiple times I've had dreams that involve this place that's kind of like a kid's gaming center, like a Chuck E. Cheese or Magic Mountain. I'm in college, and everyone who's there with me was around that age as well. Whenever I dream about this place (which has happened 2-3 times to my memory), it's always a good dream, and this one started that way as well. It was hosted by my university because there was a little area downstairs where students and staff hung out and discussed things, and there was a lot of university memorabilia down there. Anyways, we all had fun doing assorted things (I can never remember the exact games, but they were *similar* to things you might see at an arcade or Magic Mountain) then everyone met up together, either for lunch or just to chat. I don't remember any of that, so I'll skip forward to when we all went back out. First thing I remember is that some girl flashed someone and I tried to look away but saw it. I have no idea who it was or why. Anyways, a few minutes later I was walking around and heading back to this certain area, and I hear one of my girlfriend's friends calling me down. I assumed it was just because my girlfriend wanted to spend time with me, as I hadn't recalled seeing her at all in this dream prior. But, when I get down there, my girlfriend starts making these really odd movements with her mouth, not just straight up opening and closing it, but slightly contorted, almost like she's possessed but she isn't. She's making sounds, but they don't make any sense. I can tell she's trying to say words, but they aren't forming. Additionally, her face started turning a greenish complexion and puffy around her eyes. I asked her friend what the hell was happening and she simply said ""the virus"" in a soft voice. Her face was starting to turn too, so I could tell whatever my girlfriend had was seeping into her as well. I repeated, ""the virus?"" and her friend simply nodded, even a little greener than just a second ago. It's a faint hue, not like a leaf or even an animated zombie, but it was noticeable. I hugged my girlfriend, with nothing left either of them could say and nothing left I wanted to say, then I woke up, extremely startled.",1673961035.0

685,Dreams,Murder Carnival Dream,"The dream starts out with me and an unknown girl friend, walking down a narrow hotel hallway. We are laughing super hard and bantering together, while trying to find an apparent secret hidden water slide. After some time, we finally reach the end of the narrowing hall to find a small door. To our surprise, it leads directly into a gigantic dome shaped room. It’s a…carnival…?

The carnival is beaming with bright lights and laughter. Although, after walking closer inside, all of the laughter seems to be playing on a sound system. The prerecorded laughter loudly pulsates through the dome. 

The carnival is filled with weirdly obscure people from my past, mostly acquaintances from many years ago whom I’d never really known too well…Yet I see each person in great and vivid detail, I can even suddenly remember their names. They seem to all be smiling and enjoying themselves here at the carnival. 

Me and the unknown girl enter into a Medieval themed, walk-through “fun house”. The entire mood of the place shifts from here, and becomes quite spooky. We instantly get bad vibes and try to quickly walk through to the exit. There are no emergency exits, and we must continue all the way through to get out. 

As we walk through, we see lots of weird Medieval costumes and torture devices on display. The end of the “fun house” leads us directly into a ride. It’s that spinning indoor zero gravity ride, called the Gravitron. There is a ride operator in the center of the ride, dressed in complete medieval knights armor, his helmet closed shut. He stands on a platform in the center of the ride. 

The ride is filled with a small number of strangers strapped into their seats and ready to go. I don’t recognize anyone in here. Me and my friend look at eachother with a slight discomfort in our eyes, but go ahead and strap ourselves in as well since there seems to be no choice. 

Before the ride starts, some overly loud -and very creepy- carnival music slowly starts up. It’s completely deafening. The same loud, prerecorded laughter from earlier follows suit, and starts to play layered atop of the carnival music. 

The ride begins. While the outside of the ride spins, the carnival operators center platform is completely immobile. As the ride starts to slowly speed up, the carnival operator dressed in knights armor pulls out a shotgun. He creeps the gun over his shoulder. With precise aim, he times his shot perfectly to blow someone’s head right off. The victims blood splatters all over us. 

Everyone starts screaming in horror. The ride is now spinning so quickly that nobody can move….We are all tightly pinned to our seats. As everyone screams in terror, the knightsmen begins to laugh and mock us. Throwing his hands up and sarcastically screaming along. He goes to take a few more shots, this time the ride is moving so quickly that it is now a game of Russian roulette. A game of complete chance. 

Another shot goes off and hits someone right in the gut. Then in succession, two more people are shot dead. The operator laughs maniacally while we watch in fear and cry for our lives. The only people left standing in the ride are me and my girl friend. 

The ride and music abruptly come to a stop. We are both sobbing, and I notice that my friend has wet herself. The ride operator pushes a button that opens the exit for us. He stands in place, his armor makes a screeching sound as he lifts his arms up to direct us out. He then instantaneously turns to stone….like a statue, and becomes completely motionless. 

We unstrap ourselves from the ride and quickly run out. The exit doors immediately shut behind us. We are in complete shock and trying to process what just happened. Some old acquaintances instantly approach us and ask if we enjoyed the ride. “Scary, huh?” We are still sobbing, trying to explain what we just witnessed. Multiple people were just shot dead and bled out right in front of us…. The acquaintances all casually brush it off and tell us “it’s all just apart of the ride! It’s meant to be scary.” 

Next, they invite my friend and I to join them on a rollercoaster. As we walk over to the rollercoaster line, the mood starts to shift back to happy and joyful. We are all laughing and chatting together as we enter into the rollercoaster entrance. I quickly glance at a warning sign. 

“WARNING: Suicide/Cremation Coaster: The intention of this rollercoaster is to euthanize, then cremate yourself. Feel absolutely exhilarated as you take your last breaths.” 

I desperately tried multiple times to point these signs out to everyone, begging and pleading with them not to go. But everyone, even my friend, seemed to now be in some sort of bizarre trance. They each chose to ignore it. They continued to creepily laugh in unison as they, one by one, carelessly entered onto the coaster. I tried so hard to pull everyone back, but to no avail. 

I helplessly watched over as each person got into their own individual rollercoaster cart. They all pulled some sort of hood over their carts, entrapping themselves inside these apparent death carts. As I stood watching in horror from a distance, I noticed the entire carnival was now empty, and completely silent. I looked on as the rollercoaster started up and prayed to god this was all just another joke. I could see through the rollercoaster hoods that everyone was smiling. I couldn’t believe what I was witnessing. I was in complete shock and panic. 

The rollercoaster blasted off. I sat there crying to myself, forced to accept the fact that each of my friends have so casually just killed themselves. A few moments pass by, and the rollercoaster carts suddenly make their way back to the front. The hoods all automatically open back up. 

My friends have all made it back safely, and wave to me to come join them for another ride. I’m completely relieved and so happy to see my friends all safely make it back. I begin to realize maybe this carnival *is* all fake, and just meant to scare the heebiejeebies out of you. Maybe I was just overreacting, or misunderstanding this place. 

Time kind of blurs here, and I find myself pre seated into the rollercoaster. I have absolutely no recollection of getting myself into the rollercoaster….all I know is that I am now strapped in, and the coaster is slowly making itself up the launch. I’m now completely trapped inside the cart with the hood down and there is no turning back. A deep feeling of regret sets in. I look backwards to see one of my old acquaintances in the carriage behind me. He waves and smiles to me, throwing a thumbs up. 

As the coaster slowly makes its way up, there are multiple warning signs, again stating that this is a suicide rollercoaster. “Take a deep breath and it will soon be over.”  

The rollercoaster lifts off and shoots us directly into a tunnel filled with hot lava. The magma slowly fills up into my cart, as my body slowly sizzles away. My last thoughts were of absolute terror and suffering. I very slowly burned to death until all of my thoughts completely faded away into oblivion. 

I woke up at 3:30am gasping for air in complete panic and couldn’t help but feel Satan was sitting in my bedroom with me, laughing and taunting me.",1673955953.0

687,Dreams,Sharing a Dream/Nightmare I Just Had,"I don't really post much, but I don't want to forget this dream. Likely, nobody will read this, it's mostly for my wife and I. But if you do, welcome to a stupid dream. This is one of the most vivid dreams I've ever had.

I'm working at a high school with my wife. It's not our school, but it's similar. Lots of things happen in the dream at the school, but I can't remember them. I do remember, near the end of the dream, I see three young men play fighting in the locker room and one tackles the other two, causing one of the boys to hit their head. I go in to stop the horse play before somebody gets hurt. 

I then, for some reason, find myself looking at a layout of the school building at a computer. I'm noticing that the layout of the school is not what I thought it'd be, because I was thinking it was my school that I work at; rather it's octagonal with the gym coming out from the octagon. I note this. 

Then I'm standing in the middle of the school, where there's an octagonal column with a cement bench surrounding the pillar. I'm with my youngest two children. I tell them, ""Do you know how many sides the school has?"" We proceed to run around the pillar and count the sides. I remember my two year old getting excited to count, as most two year olds are, and hearing him count louder after each number. When we get to eight sides, my four year old yells, ""Eight, it's an octagon!"" I tell him good job for knowing so quickly.

I'm then in a field with my wife and both of our sons, but not the oldest daughter. I'm regailing my wife with this story and talking about how proud of them I was. We're heading back to our house, but not our house, just a farm near where our actual school is. I'm also telling my wife about the story of the kids fighting in the locker room, when I look to my left. Now this is an open Midwest field, where you can see for miles all around you. This is where it gets weird.

As I turn left I notice three, semi-tiny white translucent jelly fish over my wife's shoulder, gently descending down. I say, ""What do you think that is?"" We all look over to where I'm pointing and are all confused. I say something like, ""Maybe it's a weird light show."" That's when we can see streaks of light coming towards the jellyfish from the ground. Seconds later, we hear the explosions from the shells and bullets shooting at the jellyfish. I realize that these aren't just lights, these are giant jellyfish. And there are more coming, lots more, hundreds descending from the clouds. And there's electricity coming from them.

The world around us erupts in sounds of bullets and explosions with weird noises that sound like beam me up Scotty noises. That's when we run to the house. I scoop up my four year old and I set off. I'm not sprinting, because I don't want to outrun my wife. I turn around to see where she is, and she's keeping pace with our two year old in hand. I then see the giant jellyfish coming from above over her shoulders. They're coming right from out of the clouds, so I see their tentacles first.

I'm still running, but I know it's too late. I say to my wife, ""I love you K."" She says it back, sounding just as resigned. We keep running and I look to my son. ""I love you T."" He's just looking at me, not knowing how to process everything that's happening.

We're still running to the farm. It's getting closer, but my hopes aren't up. I'm just running. The noises from the jellyfish are unreal, as are the screams I hear in the distance. Suddenly I see blue, and feel my feet go out from under me. I fall down as the blue engulfs me. I don't know why it feels like the color blue, but it just is. There is no pain, just blue. I can no longer feel my son. I hope I fell in a way that he was safe. All I can do is just feel the blue engulf me from my feet. I remember thinking, ""Welp, this is it."" 

As the blue engulfs my head, I see nothing. I feel nothing. I'm just empty. I remember saying, ""So there really is nothing."" But I don't want that to be my last thought, so I just repeat, ""I love you K, I love you K, I love you K"" until nothing.

But the blue is now black. I realize I'm not dead, but maybe I'm alive and this is what's real? I brace myself and open my eyes, only to realize that I'm in my bed. I quickly think back to the night before and breathe a sigh of relief, as I remember heading to bed. I just had a dream. I'm laying next to my wife and I have to get ready for work in a couple hours.

You betcha that the first thing I do is get on my phone and Google white translucent jellyfish. But this dream, it was weird. I felt so helpless and useless. There wasn't a thing I could do to save my family. I just ran. I wonder how many people have had to do the same? Life is... I'm not sure... Scary? Lovely? Sad? Pointless?

688,Dreams,so I don't know what to title this but this is like a weird dream that I had,"also I'm sorry if I have any grammar mistakes English isn't my first language

so I'm currently in highschool in another country I'm not that close to my classmates its honestly weird for me to dream about them.

so it all starts with me waking up in the football yard with classmate passed out being held by my close friend and some random dude, I ask them what are they doing they said they were trying find the nearest elevator I went with them to find one, I told them we should go to the school gym.

after that I open a secret door and I find an elevator with like a seat in it, then I turn around and find a friend of mine and my ex talking and staring at me, I carry the classmate that passed out and lay her down on a chair I look at the buttons of the elevator they were in another language and they were weird looking, I clicked on the only English one it said floor 2, after the doors closed and the elevator closed I passed out.

then I wake up on my classroom floor with my phone lighting up for some reason I left it, I then went to open the elevator only to find it turned into a closet I closed the door to find where my classmate was but I find her next to a window lying down I went to look closer at her, to find her pale with blood from her mouth to her waist area pooling the floor, I then went to look outside the window to find people running and screaming, I didn't have a reaction or anything, I went to get my phone to call someone but I couldn't find the phone app and like I started  talking that its just a dream and I passed out again but switched to a different dream that I don't remember.

honestly its embarrassing for me to talk about this dream hopefully non of my friends find this lol

also like my school was different in the dream idk why",1673954054.0

690,Dreams,Controlling My Dreams,"Hello! 
First of all, I just want to say that I am incredibly happy this subreddit exists. 
Secondly, I would like to know I’m not alone. I have never tried to lucid dream or anything of the sort. 
When I’m dreaming, I can control my dreams. Not all the way, like I can’t say “I’m going to dream about puppies” and puppies will be in my dreams, but once I’m in my dream I can control it pretty well. If there’s something about a dream I don’t like, I can just say “I don’t like this part. Let me change it to xyz” and it does. I am also aware that I am dreaming whilst in a dream, and I remember them vividly when I wake up. 
I’ve never known anyone else that can do this and just wanted to see if anyone else could. 
Thank you friends and happy dreaming 💗",1673952541.0
691,Dreams,A dream about Francine Frensky’s psychosis,"I had a dream last night that Francine went absolutely psychotic and started screaming and throwing things and kinda just spinning around and flailing all over the place, and when it was all over she went down to the basement where Arthur was hiding with his mom and dad and two little kids (possibly the Tibble twins) and the little ones were crying and begging to be picked up and hugged but instead Arthur got that treatment despite being older, bigger and heavier…and there was a shot where you could see his outstretched legs lifted up against the sides of his dad’s torso…he was in pyjamas and didn’t have his slippers on, so you could see his bare feet…and I guess it was supposed to be an episode or something like that and a viewer was commenting on how it’s the only time you see Arthur get picked up and held like a little kid…

I think that means I need to stop ignoring my meds…I thought my Apple Watch Series 8 would be helpful and it honestly has been but I guess it’s not perfect…It’s only 5AM now so it’s still too early to take my morning dose but I will in about two hours, istg…",1673949624.0

694,Dreams,I dreamt that I shot Logan Pauls pet," I was hunting alone in this cold, foggy forest that was thick with pine trees when I came across a small frozen stream. The ice on the stream was more slushy than solid. I mention this, because its going to play a big part later on. I wasn’t there long before I noticed a pig rustle up from the frozen little bushes that were growing near the stream . It was a bit far away from where I was standing but, even from a distance, I could tell it was no wild pig.  I don’t remember the exact reason as to why I did it, but I shot her point blank in the right side of her head.   She let out a loud squeal that sounded more like a human mocking a pig then an actual pig. It was like the whole thing was a prop. Then she just died liked that. No struggle, nothing, just dropped dead without a fight. When a examined the pig closely, I saw that it was Logan Pauls pet teacup pig, Pearl. I horridly pushed it into the slushy stream to hide the evidence. My bullet was still in her, I know, but I’m not gonna reach inside her and pull it out not even in a dream. Eww. The slushy ice water seamed to hide her. Then I woke up.",1673941233.0
695,Dreams,i am mourning a baby from my dream,"i recently had a dream about being at a public park for some event, then a group of people showed up and started placing cartoonish bombs around (basically those round ones from smash). everyone was scattering to save themselves and others. across a small “river” was a group of conservative/religious protestors who refused to move away and one woman had a baby with her. i swam across, took the baby, and ran as far away as i could. 
i held that baby beside me for the rest of the dream. he was chubby, white, light hair, and had a onesie that was striped in two shades of blue. he wasnt even a year old i assume but i didnt know for sure. i held him so close and i wanted to protect him forever. i was horribly upset when i woke up but its only been getting worse. its days later now and i am sobbing about this child and how ill likely never see him again. 
ive NEVER wanted children and i still dont, but not knowing if this baby is safe is driving me crazy and i need to hold something living near me. i feel like i just lost my own child. i dont know what to do and i didnt know where else to go.

Basically it started out kind of creepy before it took a dark turn but the beginning isn't important. So I was in a car my dad was driving and I was sitting on the ground and feeling the wind, which felt so real. Then a car going the opposite way came charging towards us. We were going down something and we were thrown out of the car and there was this rope me and my dad grabbed on to and in my dream I was holding on to it and some thing on the side of the road high up above our car and people told me to let go and I didn't and we fell and then there were some voices I'm guessing were supposed to be news saying he was already dead when I was holding him and I saw my body over the car. It felt so realistic and before that it was in first person. I wish I could stop thinking about it. I woke up after that and went to my dad. I don't have any histories with car crashes or anything that happened. I would appreciate any advice on why I had it or how to stop thinking about it. For context I'm 14F",1673937039.0
700,Dreams,Why do my dreams sound like movies?,"Context: Alyssa is a coworker of mine. I do not know why she was in this dream and why she’s only mentioned in my dream at two separate points lol🤷‍♂️

It was a normal day working at Walmart, I had just asked if I could use some PTO to go and visit my mom and it was denied because of my occurrences and if I didn’t do better, I would be fired. I was struggling financially and was thinking about going to find another job when someone in the front end brought up a project of hers… she told me that she had been working on a project for quite a while and it was almost done so she asked if I wanted to be one of the first people to try it. Being intrigued I agreed and she brought me to this sci-fi looking door way where at first you can just walk through to the other side but if you stay in the middle of the large metal door frame, it will close off both sides and reveal a bunch of machinery. Me and a bunch of other people were all curious to know what it does but no one knew, not even the person who created it. I wanted to be one of the first people to try it but Alyssa pushed her way through and got in first thinking it was a Time Machine. I was upset but let her go and another person was to go with her and I was told I had to complete a few pages of paperwork before I can test the experiment. Once I was done, I was taken back to the machine and Alyssa was no where to be found and so I stepped inside the machine, they told me good luck and in a flash of light I was completely somewhere else… it looked like earth but I was stuck in the middle of a large area of what looked like redwood trees… it was barely day time at this point and I started looking around for other people and that’s when I realized someone was waiting for me. He was in a panicked state and told me to hurry and that we didn’t have much time. I asked him what’s wrong. He showed me the most terrifying and grotesque organism I’ve ever seen. It definitely wasn’t from home… this organism had a deformed head with a mouth constantly open because of how big the teeth were, the whitest dead looking eyes and skin so pale that you can see the veins through them. And the most creepy part about it is that it had legs coming out of the head. Before I could even react and ask questions, darkness fell… the man was terrified at this point and told me we have to go and meet with the others. Before I could ask where, a bunch of hissing sounds could be heard in the distance and he screamed RUN… as we start running, I look behind us and see that a whole SWARM of the grotesque looking heads are skittering in our direction at an alarming rate. I was absolutely terrified at this point and started yelling at the guy that we just need to teleport back and he told me that this was only a one way teleport but soon they would be able to bring us back… as the creatures start catching up to us, we come up to a cliff ledge and the man throws me a parachute and told me to jump with him. We jump and pull our parachutes and fly down towards the other end of the valley where there are strange animals of the planet or dimension but these animals are also very different from the ones back home but still resemble them in some way. As we finally touch the ground after parachuting away, we meet up with the other test subjects, as well as Alyssa, inside this giant base they had created. They start explaining their experiences and what was going on but really no one knew where they were or why besides the fact that they agreed to step into the chamber that teleported them. We then get a message from the base telling us the next course of action in order to survive and that the message was from earth… they knew where we were, did they know what was here? If so, why would we go here?",1673936685.0

702,Dreams,"I think I had one of the best dreams, if not THE best dream in my life, it felt so real, strange...and I wanted to share it with someone else","Introduction/Context: the protagonists are me (2001 Male) and a girl I like (2003 Female). Back in 2019 I discovered this girl that went in the same school of mine, and since then like the 80% of the guys of the school (80% of its students are males) simped for her (if there was an election to choose between some candidates to be students' representative, and this girl was one of them, you could have bet 100k that she was going to win those elections). She knows she is beautiful, she knows she can do what she wants; she has black hair and light blue eyes, but I think she is kind too...one of the most wonderful girls I ever met irl, a goddess. Adding a note maybe useful for the explanation of the dream: like a year ago a friend of mine told me that a friend of him had sex with this girl and that she was perfect in doing blowjobs but...no spoilers haha.

Well, I almost never spoke with her in the school corridors or similar (also because she went to another branch of the school because she was in another class, so I saw her everyday just for 2 years), just one time we chatted on Instagram and she left a like to an old pic of me (sad that she unfollowed me and a lot of other guys when she got in a relationship with another guy she broke with after few months). I don't even know if she knows I exist 😂

The Dream:

We were in a bed in an hotel and we were looking at some things on the phone when I realized I had a face like [when Ryan Gosling is smiling in Drive (2011)](https://tenor.com/bxGiy.gif), and then she says: ""wtf are you smiling at with that dumb face"" so I reply: ""eheh what? What's wrong with my face? I'm okay"" and then she shocks me with ""I'm sure I know why you have that face, you can't wait to fuck me huh, well..."". She turns and sits on my knees while I'm lying on the bed with the legs spread (like cowgirl position but a bit lower, at knee heigh). She pulls my underwear down and starts sucking my whole dick and massage the balls with one hand, and when she arrives at the end of the shaft, she starts licking the balls with the whole tongue, I felt like a pain/pleasure/warm sensation, I couldn't resist, after few minutes of this mystical thing, I came in her mouth. She stops for few seconds to cough and right after she decides to ""punish"" me by sucking and licking harder than before, I start begging her to stop and after half minute she stops and says ""so you're no more that though guy you were before"" and laughs. She turns around and lies down with her back upwards, and I start to caress her back and cuddle her. After few minutes she turns around again and I put her hand on my cock and she grabs it, but right after she goes to the bathroom to do something, meanwhile I take the phone to text my friends somthing like ""I DID IT GUYS, I DID IT, I CAN'T BELIEVE"". Here comes the worst part..something in my real mind doesn't add up: how this can be real? IS it real? Everything starts to blur and I wake up with the sound of the rain outside of my bedroom, it wasn't real, too good to be real, I stay few minutes with my eyes closed thinking how good this dream was, and how real it felt...damn, I don't think I'll experience something similar again.",1673936369.0

I put everything up,took a nap,and had a dream,I saw a series of my future life, basically a 2 lane highway. On one side,I marry a gorgeous woman,we make incredibly good money,have tons of babies, and live a moderately great life,but a short one,alzheimers.
Now the one I fear I'm on, my mental health continues to dwindle,I fall in and out of drugs to cope with my mental health,in and out of jail,multiple baby mama's,that I put my heart into,but they're just looking for a check,this causes more drug use,more attempts on my own life, I grow to be morbidly obese,grumpy,and horribly disfigured from so many attempts,and I live a long,lonely life. 

And it's weird,as hell,because I'll be doing something,and I'll get small flashbacks to those dreams,and it's literally what I'm doing at that point.

So my question,how much should I read into these dreams,I'd I remember correctly. I'm on the bad path. There's also the secret path, which I was shown my own funeral,at quite the young age as well. But do I take stock into these dreams,or do I do my own thing?",1673932431.0

707,Dreams,Death garden,"I was on my way to this abandoned  garden, on a forest path with dense, lush grass. I had this very strong feeling of loneliness, the trees, flowers, bugs, they were all hauntingly beautiful, but somehow felt hostile. There was this clearly ominous atmosphere - as lonely as i felt, i wasn’t really alone, the garden was alive, watching, observing, waiting for me to make the wrong move. This is where the dream gets a little fuzzy and weird - i was there to transmit a message, complete a minor task for someone and then be on my way. I call (what seemed to be) the owner of the garden - a girl (maybe in her 20s), telling her that whatever it seems that some friend of mine did to her, it wasn’t his fault and it was a misunderstanding. She was mad, she had a deep hatred for the guy i was trying to excuse, and with a tremble in her voice started accusing me of having some ill intent to lie to her, console her while she was down, and then manipulate her to get my hands on her garden. As the conversation goes on, it turns out that this girl was actually obssesed with me, growing a whole natural paradise for me - so that we would live there together someday. The more we talk, the more watched i feel, every plant in that garden is hearing my every word, following my every step. The place looks decrepit, like there was no one there in a very long time. We start arguing, i take offense and become more and more agressive until she warns me, with a kind of panic in her voice, that for every man there is a woman that he needs to treat right, or HE will come. At first, i thought this was just another lecture, even though the raw fear i could feel growing in her while she said it was strange. As she was saying it, a horrible thought went through my mind - what if i did manipulate her and got my hands on her garden. After all, it was built for me, i’m entitled to it. She couldnt finish her sentence before i saw this man, with a red stripe on his face, slowly approaching the dilapidated fence of the garden. I somehow knew him, but was too focused on arguing to react. He had this stoic demeanour, like every action he took was deliberate, with a clear goal in mind and nothing could stop him from achieving it- he was a force of nature. He started climbing the fence, all while staring directly in my eyes. I remembered who this man was - but i was too late to react. I was as good as dead. HE was him… the garden had been watching, and i made the wrong move. This gaping feeling of pure terror and desperation engulfed me while i started running for my life. The panic was too great for me to stay awake, so the dream ended there, but im sure i would have been killed. 

This whole dream was incredibly terrifying, and while the themes might seem obvious, i think there might be more to it than just me feeling guilty about the way i treat my girlfriend. The whole thing had this uneasy feeling to it - it seemed like the garden was the only thing in that universe and that i was somehow being tested.",1673930527.0

When I get there I realise I need to go home but I can't afford the train ride back, I meet someone I know in real life who is with a group of people I don't know and they say they can get me home. I feel like I can trust these people and they don't feel suspicious or anything like that. They go and talk to the people running the train and they do some work on a computer and then I am sitting next to them on a chair, they hand me a piece of paper and ask me to stamp it (the paper is wet for some reason) I look down to stamp it and when I look back up I am in my own country again.

As a bonus, this is the second time I've had this dream, the first time I woke up there but this time it went on for a little bit longer.

In the second dream after that happens, I remember that I've had this dream before so I ask the person what happened, he takes me outside and says something along the lines of ""Time can be strange in dreams/ you need to wake up from your nap"" he then pushes me to the ground and I slow down just before my head hits the pavement where I am then waking up from a nap on the sidewalk and he and the group of people are gone",1673927460.0

This man in a tattered black hoodie and sweatshorts was with another guy who was in khaki cargo shorts and a t shirt that said MALZ. 

They said the paramedics were coming but they never came. The entire suburb was in chaos. I didn't know what we were running from. I ended up injured somehow and remember being carried into a house by an older man and taken into a basement for safety.  I remember seeing a discarded baby doll on the ground too, with its voice box ripped out of its chest. It repeated the same phrase over and over ""I love you, but do you love me?

I know is not just dreams because the feeling is the same as being awake, since I've been doing this for a long time it's really easy to tell the difference, plus my room is exactly the same, with things in the same place I left them when I got in bed. Sometimes I feel things grab or touch me, but as I can recognize that is all in my mind, I just make them go away. I rarely open my eyes since I am scared of what I could see. At one point it happened so regularly that I started doing this thing where I would wake up, body really heavy, I would slowly stand up and put my hand and forehead against the window next to my bed. I would start concentrating and eventually I would go through the glass as if it was water. Once I would come out on the other side I would appear in different scenarios. Extremely similar to dreams, but felt more real as if it was actually different dimensions or something. However this stopped for like a year but yesterday it came back. This time I was going to do the window thing but when I opened my eyes for a second, I could see a dragon like head poking through the window looking at me, wasn't scary, and a thing floating across the room. This thing was a circle with different geometric shapes attached to it. After a couple of seconds I closed my eyes and started doing what I do to wake up from this heavy state which is trying to do abrupt movements till I finally wake up. After that I went to sleep again and have a really weird dream but I've had tons of those and this is already suuuuper long (lol sorry) Does anybody have any idea what this is? If is not sleep paralysis, what is it?",1673923729.0
721,Dreams,a jarring dream about an abortion,"i had an abortion as a 15 year old in 1999. I regret it every day. I always thought it was a boy (dont know) and even have a memorial tattoo with that boy name.

Today i woke up in a cold sweat. i had a dream it was a girl. And she was born and adopted by the father's sister (who IRL at the time was just a child) but in the dream she was an adult and adopted this baby girl. It was years later and the sister was mad. And I guess i didn't know but the baby had a severe birth defect and was non-verbal &amp; wheel chair bound. No idea why the sister was mad but the father was there and upset also (not with me)

Dont know why this scared me. Dont know what it meant. Ive never had a dream like this in 23 years. Ive had almost no dreams about this child/baby and this is really the only one i can remember.  Definitely jarring.",1673922099.0

727,Dreams,Abduction/attraction,"Soo to start off I always have incredibly vivid dreams (good and bad) Even after waking they almost seem like a memory. Lol

Last night I had a dream that my husband and I (as teens, we are in our late 20s now) we’re outside at my parents house. All of a sudden he looks at me super serious and says “go in the house now” I can see him looking around in the trees as if he’s searching for something. I listen to him and make my way back to the house, really worried. 
I open the back door and there is a man in  all black blocking the way. He smiles and all of a sudden is in front of me and grabs me as I try going back down the steps. I try yelling for help several times, but nothing comes out. Eventually I get out a “help, call 911!” 
This man is still standing right front of me, and has me in an embrace, to keep me from going anywhere. A scary looking little women with stringy black hair and dirty skin/ smile. Was sharpening her knife to the side of him. 
She walks up and slowly stabs him in the back to test how sharp it is. I look at both of them in horror but they both laugh. 
The man starts talking nicely. “You know we know each other right?” “We’ve talked a lot.” “I’m so glad I found you” I could tell he was kinda into me? I don’t know. Definitely had a soft spot. 
As we walked down the road (he still has me by the arm) I started seeing satanic ritual spot everywhere. The creepy girl told me they were from them.
I told the man I had to pee and he let me squat down behind the neighbors trailer. But the neighbor walked outside so we moved down the road. (I had to pee In real life so that was a priority for me lol) 
I heard the neighbors tv say that there was kidnapping so I knew my husband got away and called for help. 
I was in the process of peeing and when the man got really pervy. I started thinking maybe he will just r@pe me and let me go. 
Until I saw the body of a woman being put into the car they were about to put me in. It was mangled and she would definitely die soon. 
That’s when I decided to run. I made it to the big hill on my parents road, but it turned into more of a cliff. I couldn’t climb it. I woke up right as the creepy girl was about to grab me. 
I have had dreams like this before (childhood trauma) but for some reason I can’t get this man out of my mind. 🫣 I’m not scared of him, even though I know I should be. I’m more interested in his story and what he has to say, because he was so gentle. I can’t figure out why though.",1673918305.0

731,Dreams,I have very special dreams,"I don’t have the same exact dream every time but it’s set in an alternate universe where the asteroid that killed the dinosaurs was 4-7 kilometers instead of 10-15, which led lots of dinosaurs to survive and evolve, as well as a unique carnivorous plant.

1. Archaeopteryx- It became a massive carnivorous bird, known as the Canyon Dragon easily big enough to take down a bear, and live in canyons. They find one cave to live in and build a nest out of metal scraps, which leads adventurers to try and drive them off to take their nests as treasure. They have enormous serrations that face away from them instead of towards their throat, as they use the serrations to cut through the tough exterior of the boulder beasts

2. Ankylosaurs- This is definitely the biggest stretch yet. They were far from small, after all. But they survived and became camouflaged in a similar sense to sloths: Plants grow on them, from vines and grasses to small bushes. Not only does this give them fantastic camouflage, but can act as a source of food as well. Unfortunately, they lost some of the toughness of their armor and shrank, and are now a viable food source for the Canyon Dragons as the Boulder Beasts.

3. Trap Flower- It’s unknown what they evolved from, but these little plants are dangerous to many insects, especially gnats. They have a tower in the middle covered in tiny flowers that ooze a viscous, sweet smelling liquid that messes with a gnat’s ability to fly. This means they will drink their fill then likely fall onto the large fuzzy leaves below, where small hairs push them towards a hidden chamber underground filled with digestive fluids.

4- Velociraptor. These guys became lizard wolves, essentially. Now ruling snowy forests, their white and black feathers act both as camouflage and insulation. They grew to be the size of whitetail deer and travel in family groups of 4-5. They lost their sickle claw to run faster, twisting between the trees like a liquid as they hunt. They are nocturnal, giving them large, avian eyes similar to an owl. They cannot climb very well, as their forelimbs are too small, but can jump high and run fast.

734,Dreams,Groundhog Day dream,"I have frequent peculiar and vivid dreams, and they’re never the same. Seldom happy, seldom sad — most are just incredibly odd and unsettling. I remember the odd and unsettling ones in grave detail. 

This time last year, I had a “Groundhog Day” dream. Throughout this dream it increasingly became more “real.” The first two “wake ups” I had I knew it felt like a dream, but every time after that, the feelings I had in it felt real. It was a traumatizing scenario, to say the least, that continued to replay. The second to last repeat, I thought I had finally woken up and was out of breath, trembling, reaching for my phone to check the time. When I couldn’t find my phone, the scenario occurred again. 

The last time (before I woke up) the scene was playing out but I was not getting out of bed. With every inch of me I tried to simply TWITCH a muscle and I couldn’t. Similar to sleep paralysis. It reminds me of a dream I had where I was “screaming” but there was no noise. The second I gave up on trying to get out of my bed is when I ACTUALLY woke up, and I was physically exhausted. 

Here’s my question:
Would this be considered sleep paralysis? I know that it’s said to happen upon falling asleep and waking up from sleep, but I was 100% still dreaming, as the events were exactly the same as the times before. I have never had a dream like this again.",1673912544.0
735,Dreams,I just had the craziest dream I've had in a long time.,"Im in my house watching TV or something and this tiny monkey keeps coming out of hiding and biting me. I grab the monkey and twist it's head and go downstairs to dispose of it. I then decide to go to the skatepark that me and my friends skate and hangout at. On the way a couple of people start following me around and singing really annoying songs. I somehow lose them and get to the skatepark. I get there and see a bunch of people I don't know and 1 person I do know. I go up and say hi and he says ""why would I care about a (my first name and last name) I respond with ""whatever I just came here to skate."" I go to to skate and do a super stylish air (felt pretty exaggerating compared to how I usually get them) and when I do it everyone at the park boos and somebody says ""you need to do that better"" I get back to the entrance to the bowl and a bunch of people start walking up to me and saying mean things to me. I forget how this part ends, but next thing I know I'm in a weird brown factory of some kind. Im on this weird barred platform and I can only move my head. After a minute the bars separate and I fall down into a pit just to wake up back on the platform. I somehow get out but after a couple of seconds I see this cartoon blue cow who looks upset that I'm not on the platform. I go back to the platform but I forget to put my head on the ground of the platform and instead have it propped up against a wall. He notices this and walks over to me, when I somehow get out and make him stuck in the paralysis I had before. The perspective then zooms out and the sky is dark and everything is purple. and a narrator says ""the factory was soon shut down due to cannibalism and rotting bodies being found in body bags."" I find myself in a purple area with nothing, didn't seem big but it didn't have any walls, just a small purple area. And a tree symbol starts forming underneath me (ended up looking exactly like the Celtic tree of life when I looked up tree symbols when I woke up) that I somehow knew immediately to be a portal. An owl man thing then appears and next thing I know I'm in a class room and the credits for something called ""The Aversion that Excites"" is playing on a projector. I look to the classmate sitting next to me and we are both in shock. They send me out of class and I'm on my way to the gym. When I get to the gym I see Mike Tyson and I ask him if he ever had to do the aversion that Excites in school. He looks off for a second and says yeah. I then ask ""how do you know you're fully back into reality?""  He then says ""what is reality? The universe always wants me to say one thing, but am I going to say the second thing? Yeah."" And then it ends once I get into the gym. The thing that tripped me out the most was that the tree symbol I saw towards the end of ""the aversion that excites"" turned out to look exactly like the Celtic tree of life.",1673912287.0
736,Dreams,still giggling about this one,"i can only remember a few parts. the best bit was when i told my mum about her cousin's massive house that i'd visited and my sweet dear old mum said 'did she fuck a badger?' i said you what? she said 'in the 90s when we knew that a woman had money we'd say 'she either looks good, she sucks good, or she's fucked a badger''. i've got no idea what it means. i get the misogyny of some of it but not the badger part. it's the sort of joke that my brain makes up when i'm asleep and sounds a lot funnier in my sleep. there was a badger in my dream as well, it was a piebald bear in the style of bob clampett, he drew them like big badgers. in another bit i was exploring that massive house that my mum's cousin had acquired and there was a wall in her bedroom that had created another little room that could only be accessed from a secret stairway and not from the room itself, the stairway was behind a door downstairs that looked like wall. she'd been keeping all her used underwear in the secret room and i sniffed her bras. she called me a dirty get when i told her. and i remember another bit where someone asked me to give her a glass of helen's sherry. i told her she can't have it, it's helen's. she said no i said the halloween sherry",1673912099.0

I am the creator of a Dream Journal app called DreamKit([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dreamkit-dream-journal/id1572753006), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.DreamKit.DreamKit.dreamkit&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1)).

I finally launched the dream interpretation feature integrating the most advanced AI technology. To be honest, I was not a very fan of dream interpretation because it's very subjective and I believed interpretations are meaningless most time. However, after seeing the results, I completely changed my mind. The AI-powered dream interpretation for my dream journal gives a very detailed interpretation and provides great insight into my mind.

Of course, I am biased about it because I am the one who created the app but I will appreciate it if you give it a try. I am VERY confident a lot of people will love this feature for sure. It's mind-blowing.

1. Write a dream journal
2. Tap the ""book"" button on the dream journal screen, then you will get the interpretation based on your input.

Here is an example:

739,Dreams,Tonight I dreamt I was The Doctor (from Doctor Who),"Tonight I dreamt I was The Doctor from Doctor Who and I had invented a gun that gently shoots tasty treats to all sorts of animals so I can give all animals a little snack from a distance as to not bother them and not get attacked :)

Also I ended up on a future spaceship. It was nighttime, so the crew was asleep, but the ship was monitoring everything and everyone, so I could see what they were dreaming. Some of them were realy dirty and it revealed that this one guy had feelings for some girl and it made things really awkward when other crew members woke up and saw it. But then she died, but that didn't really matter cuz her soul had been uploaded to the ship's system so she could simply get her body fixed in no time by this super intelligent high tech robot thingy and re-enter as soon as it was done EXCEPT there was a glitch in the system so her soul was stuck in this hellish limbo and we couldn't save her.

R.I.P. girl, I never did catch your name

I just wanna clarify that I did try everything in my power to save her, but I woke up before I could

Also nobody wanted to talk to the guy anymore cuz he had some really nasty dreams. Felt pretty bad for him tbh, it's not like he could help what he dreamt about

Oh well. Humans. Always inventing new and increasingly convoluted ways to judge each other

\--------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------------

Bear with me here, this is just me making shit up to finish the story cuz I need closure lmao

The answer probably lied in something as seemingly irrelevant as the Snack Gun™ I had invented earlier

Like, I probably had to smash it to bits cuz it contained a component that would override the system and set her soul free

But then I'd have to face a choice: either set her free and let her soul die - and in a way, killing her myself - or keep her soul alive but in eternal limbo

And thennn it would come to light that I had encountered a civilisation where death had become taboo, so all the crew would protest against letting her soul go, so I would have to have a classic Doctor rant and teach them that endings aren't necessarily bad things. That all things must end and that it makes room for new things to begin. And eventually they would come to their senses and we would all set her soul free together.

They would go on to start a movement that speaks out against cheating death, so humans can live a normal life once again, with a beginning and an end

And they all lived - and died - happily

OH and of course me smashing up my beloved Snack Gun™ would help solidify the idea that the end of things can also mean the beginning of a new",1673910184.0

The moon crashing against the earth, and I feel so helpless and afraid.

 Sometimes I'm on earth looking up, and other times I'm outside of my body, watching from space.   


 Sometimes this is also paired with the sun destroying the world too. Never with an explosion, just the sun colliding with the world, engulfing the planet. I've only ever escaped it once by teleporting away, but not before the sky became a blaze of fire and I could feel the heat.  
 It always begins with the sun getting closer and it becoming hot and bright.  
 Unlike the moon version, I don't realize the sun is getting closer until it's too late, and I'm never on the outside looking in, I'm ALWAYS on earth.   


 The sun always comes after the moon when they're together, but everything seems to reset to be destroyed by the sun next.

There are also times where local police would notice some people disappearing and would ask me if I know something by paying me a visit and I also kill them and do some gorey stuff with their remains.

Then I'll wake up drenched in sweat as if I was really there panicking with what to do next.
I started having these dream/nightmares back in 2016/17

759,Dreams,"do dreams have any implications/clues for our future, or are they completely arbitrary and simply an amalgamation of our thoughts?","many people speculate about the “4D” and suggest that the dream state/dream world allows us insights into higher realms, the ability to communicate telepathically, glimpse into parallel realities and universes, and so on. some people even believe that the 4D is the “real, unrestricted world” and that the 3D is a world of illusions.

others believe that dreams are merely a random hodgepodge of our most prominent thoughts.

what do you believe? is there evidence or discussion to suggest that dreams are more than random? of course, i don’t think any of us have concrete answers, but i’m interested to hear people’s thoughts.",1673893135.0
760,Dreams,"I Dreamt about a Dental Surgeon punishing his receptionist by peeling off the flesh of a patient that died in his care, and placing it on her face and body","I dreamt about a dystopian dental office. 

There was an older patient who had died at the dental office because one of his wisdom teeth grew out of his jaw sideways and contacted an artery and he bled to death. 

The receptionist of this dental office was gossiping on an online forum about the nature of the case, as it had gone through her dental office. 

The dental surgeon  who oversaw the patients care learned of the receptionist commenting on the case online, and showed up to the office unannounced, carrying a large white duffle bag, and calmly asked the receptionist to go wait in his office and take a seat in the examination chair. The receptionist was an older middle aged lady, and she was visibly afraid.

Once the receptionist was seated, the dentist entered the office and placed his duffle bag on the counter. Then, from the bag, he removed the top portion of the corpse of the patient who had died in his care. Think, from the ribcage up, but the arms had been removed. It was just the mans head, shoulders, and rib cage. The receptionist started to scream and sob.

The dentist strapped the receptionist into the chair, and began to peel the skin off of the torso and place the various parts on the receptionists body. For example, he would skin the cheek off the corpse, and place it on top of the receptionists cheek (almost like a re-enactment)

As he peeled away layers of skin, the wisdom tooth in question was revealed. I vividly remember seeing the pink of tendon/cartilage on the jaw bone of the corpse with this big tooth just jutting out the side of his face. By the time the dream was over, the receptionist was covered in the skin and material of the corpse, and the jaw bone where the wisdom tooth penetrated through was the only thing left on the table.",1673891995.0

762,Dreams,"The past week I've been doing some weightlifting and going to bed earlier, and my dreams have been much more vivid, weird, numerous, and memorable than usual.","Here were some of the dreams from last night that I remember:

I was in a movie theater with tons of people I know, and after one movie finished we were deciding what movie to watch next. The first couple seconds of Star Wars episode IV started playing. It had a much deeper cave/asteroid/outer space vibe than the actual movie. For some reason someone asked if it had girl-boss moments in it, and I said that it did have some girl-boss moments in it.

Then we weren't watching a movie anymore, we were all taking a test. Toward the end of the test I realized that everyone else had written their answers on black paper with white ink, and I had written my answers on white paper with a pen. Then I noticed in the rules of the test that one of the rules was that you would receive no credit unless you wrote your answers on black paper with white ink. I then tried to take a piece of black paper from a large pile next to a girl who was taking the test, but she made some sort of noise and I got the feeling she wasn't willing to share. I turned my white paper test in anyway apprehensively.

I woke up and went back to sleep, and then I was in this weird bright baby blue house next to the water, I remember being in one room, and crawling into a window sill, but it sloped downwards at about 45 degrees for like 8-10 ft. Then later in the house I thought that if I put my phone in the microwave that some sort of special image would appear on the screen, but when it was done, it had all turned into a hot greenish goo covering the bottom of the microwave.

I don't specifically remember the dreams from other nights but I know there were long journeys, a car breakdown and crash where the steering wheel felt really weird and hard to turn, and a ton of other random stuff.",1673890997.0

765,Dreams,Mt. Hope,"It was a weird dream for sure. It was kind of like going back in time. This must be an old small town because everyone was super friendly, and it gave almost a church community vibe(I'm not religious). I was a young girl, maybe in my late teens/early 20s(i'm in my 30s). I fell in love with a guy. I can't remember what he looked like. I got pregnant and we got married. I got pregnant again right after my first baby and had Irish twins. I would eventually have a third child. Our relationship seemed to go very well, and we were happy. I think he worked in a city and I feel like there was more in the dream but I can't remember.

One of my children, a girl, seemed a bit strange. I think she could predict something was going to happen. She seemed angsty that day. Her father was up at the mountain, called Mt. Hope. At some church or something behind the mountain. Anyways, we watched it get bombed. Like it got bombed so hard that the mountain started throwing rocks at the town(not literally...just the explosions were making rocks go everywhere). I was trying to find my children and husband. I almost got killed by a giant rock as I was hiding behind and kind of under a car. Afterwards, we were told it was an attack. By who, idk. 

Dream got kind of weird after that. My daughter said her father was alive and I saw him. But we buried him cause we thought he was dead. He dug himself out of the cemetery. Was angry at me for a long time cause I left him there. It was chaos. I think he wanted a divorce.  It was a weird dream.",1673886777.0

767,Dreams,Dreamt that a grey alien was parasitising my dreams?,"The dream was quite normal in its entirety, but I had the feeling of being stuck in what was quite a nice house by the beach. I wanted to leave from the beginning, not sure why, but people would show up and certain problems would arise, I'd feel bad and try to help them, yet they kept showing up, so I stayed. It was so many people, not all at once, but with different problems, or stories, trying to get my attention. I knew something bad was up, as I had a weird feeling, almost of being in a horror movie, even though nothing too horrible was happening. After too much dream drama I decided I had enough and didn't care to help or do anything anymore, so I started to leave. As I did that, different people started showing up on my path, some suddenly in the dark as a way to scare me I guess, and kept following me right behind me to the exit, kind of trying to distract me from leaving. I was decided on my path and kept going, until right at the door, there was this woman who started to explain to me something intricate about quantum physics and light while showing me this beautiful stained glass. I said ""cool, interesting"" but turned around for the door to leave, and as I did so she suddenly turned into a very realistic grey alien who was so angry and aggressive, and he bit me! He bit both sides of my neck and I was so frozen I couldn't react. As this happened, I woke up, really feeling the bite, in a way I almost can't describe, but as an eerie very weird feeling on my neck as if someone would aggressively tickle you combined with the feeling you get when someone scratches a blackboard with its nails. Idk how to say it, but worse thing is I still feel it now. What could that be? A metaphor for something? An alien trying to feed off my dreams? It was so weird...",1673886469.0

769,Dreams,My scary dream experience,"Hi guys this is my first post here but I thought I’d share my dream from last night. When I finally got asleep last night it felt like my body floated through a barrier, almost like through a dark ocean. There was people there, in this dark place. I recall saying hello, and they respond “you can see us?” “You shouldn’t be here”. At this point I try to go back through this barrier again to get back into my bed but I think I take the barrier to the wrong place as something feels off. At this point I am aware that I must be dreaming but I am still in control of my body and thoughts. At this part my memory becomes a little but fuzzy but I remember either the devil himself or a demon not letting me leave and telling me I’m stuck there, everywhere I went the demon would show up and I eventually forced myself back through this barrier in the end.

To me the barrier felt like crossing worlds, I floated through dark water until I got through the other side. I don’t know if this was just a crazy dream or if it had any meaning but normally my dreams don’t connect like that, normally the story of my dreams change every 2 mins but this one was consistent and I was in control of my body and aware I was dreaming so it was weird.",1673885512.0

For context, I wanna ssy that IRL, I'm not someone who is aventurous or likes to travel.

So it starts like this : It's 2022.
I am with some friends ( I don't remember the faces). We watch tv.  We're in brazil.

On the news, Trump is still president and he decretes that unless you are a citizen of the USA, you cannot get in or out.

So me and my friends go and take a flight to mexico and we then try to cross the border by water. We have two boats but there was not enough space for me. So I had to swim. I swim for hours and we get to shore. We then take turns swimming so we can get back to canada. At some point we have our longest swim yet : we have to go from somewhere in the usa to New York and I volunteered to swim. When I arrived, I got out of the water and saw a girl. She felt familiar but I have never seen her face before. And I knew I cared deeply about her. She said she was worried about me and she's happy I'm here and she hugged me.

I faint. I wake up. I am in a hotel room, in a bed, alone. I open my phone and I got 50sms from names I didn't recognize, all being worried about me. 

I stand up and look around. I look at myself. On each of my arms, I see 6 black (either hearts or aces) tatoos. I then say aloud ""Am I dreaming?""
I do one step and I really wake up. 

I am still confused about this dream.

Also about the tatoos I am 90% sure they were black hearts.

790,Dreams,"I (16 F) just had two consecutive nightmares where I died, in one of which I also killed a school bus full of students; what does this mean?","Sorry this is so long, but I really need some guidance.

In the first dream, I went out in the middle of the night, found a school bus, and went on a joyride. I turned into a parking lot to take a break fro a while but I just happened to park in a school parking lot and some girls sports team ended up getting on the bus. I was too scared to tell them all that I wasn’t actually a bus driver because I would get in big trouble, so I slyly asked which school they needed to go to and started on my way there. Eventually I really started doubting myself and I knew that I couldn’t make the journey to the school and back and at one point I just wanted it to be over so while we were driving over a thin road on a volcano (dream logic, right?), I tried going faster to just get it over with. Obviously that didn’t end well because I drove the school bus off the edge of the road, killing everyone as they plummeted into the lava. I could hear all the kids screaming as they fell to their dooms and I felt nothing but guilt for my wrongdoing.

I felt so bad about what happened that I wanted to go back and see if they were ok. So, I traveled back in time to that exact day that the sports team was getting on their ACTUAL bus and I got on with them. I looked around and they were all there. Every single kid who was there before was there now and they were alive. I was so relieved

I started talking to them as I was excited to see what they were like before watching them in their school event. I asked about why they hadn’t gone to Orange County Day High School for their match today and they mentioned that they wouldn’t be going there anymore because of a bombing that happened while they were there. Of course, I was curious to see what actually happened that day, so I time traveled back to the time when they had just arrived at Orange County Day High School. We heard shots from outside. I look over and there’s an older man holding a pistol and shooting at another man who is out of sight. We start hiding under the seats as we begin to hear returning fire. We were all scared for our lives. Before we knew it, that unseen man was now giving us a monologue on the bus. He mentioned a phrase and wanted someone to repeat it when prompted. He picked me. I didn’t repeat it correctly. He held the gun to my chest and I thought in my head “This is it, this is how I die”. And in that universe, I was right. He pulled the trigger and I went limp. I saw a faint video game death screen over the translucent blackness that clouded my vision (I’m assuming my brain created that because I couldn’t mentally handle actually dying in such a way). 

I reluctantly wake up and I can feel this pressure in my chest where he shot me; right in the middle of my chest. I just don’t know what to do now. I’ve never had two consecutive nightmares like this and I have no idea what they could mean or how to move forward from here.",1673872852.0

There was a TV in the front of the classroom. 

some guys were throwing some things at the wall out of boredom

and one guy threw it too close to the TV and it fell down. 

I was kind of scared of my own thoughts, 

because I thought if I was left with only my thoughts for too long

I would go insane,

there were full pigs on a rod in a big oven, 

there was beef, kebab, sausages, kräuterbutter and much more.

thinking I was a swede for some reason, 

he had a college with him

 Next it was probably summer, because we were dressed lightly and were outside. 

We had to play a game where we were running on a stadium

in circles and each time we were told to stop

we would have to find BBs off the ground and throw them at each other, 

if u got hit u were out, what was the purpose we were not told,

I told her that her name has a beautiful meaning in estonian. 

soon others started to come to the place we were sitting at, 

a blonde girl who threw a bb at me, I did the same, she had a bossy face

and then a brunette girl who also threw a bb at me, I did the same, 

at least 1 guy joined as well, but he didn't throw a bb at me. 

We are talking when I notice that everyone is already running again

(I was the only one facing the stadium) 

and told others that we have to go running fast, 

because we didn't know whether we would get punished or not.

because it had a red cross on it, but more advanced.

expecting me to ready the ambulance for lift off, 

I had to go to the front of the vehicle and put a key in and turn it,

793,Dreams,I Need A Dentist!,"I was in university in my dorm that I shared with 2 other roommates, a shaved head man and a black haired woman. We didn't have separate rooms; think more like a large studio apartment with a wall of tall windows. 

Outside our door is a mall, with plenty of different stores, including an animal shelter/vet. We're part of an anti-capitalist protest group and we usually get a target from a random guy. We were told to steal Dude Wipes and other small things.

I don't see the purpose of it so I decide to just chill with an owner less labradoodle dog on a couch. When I start petting him I feel 2 of my teeth wiggle, my canine and a smaller tooth next to it. I open my mouth to catch them falling out. 

When they come out, they're sorta jn half? The canine looks like a dog tooth in the way that it's long width wise. There's a plastic bit in it, I believe to hold the tooth in place in my mouth? The other tooth has some white paper in it and after I shake it out it turns into a clear command hook. I recognize it as both a hook and my tooth. 

I start panicking and head back to my dorm and get online to look for a dentist. At first all I type in is nonsense, and get nonsense results back. But anxiety is kicking in full gear, so I keep typing until I actually manage to write ""URGENT DENTIST"", finding a 24 hour one nearby. 

My roommates are telling me it's no big deal but I'm already running out. I forget to bring my teeth with me, trying to think of all the ways the dentist can fix this. 

I get I to my car but I realize i have no idea how to get to the dentist. I try to get the directions on my phone but end up frustrated and take off anyway. I get stuck leaving the University parking lot, then I wake up

799,Dreams,I dreamt meeting someone I don't know,"I woke up an hour/two ago and I'm still, feeling weird. My dream went like this:

I was with 3 old friends, currently in my real life I only talk with one of them, I stopped being friends with the other 2 around 3-4 years ago? Maybe more.

They were playing in a big kinda park, it was a big plane of green grass at night and some metallic monument in the middle, the monument was very triangular. All this is in my city although I have no idea where this was. I was watching them but not playing or having fun with them, until now this was more of a nightmare.

I had no idea where I was and it was late so I wanted to return home with them, when approaching the gates of the park, there were 3 small elevators that I think led to the subway. All three of them went into one of them separately in a blink of an eye.

Then, a girl came out of the left elevator, I don't remember a lot about her looks but she was a bit shorter than me, had black hair around shoulder length? She said hi to me, then went towards the gates of the park, I followed her and then checked my mobile to see where I was and how to return home with Google Maps, but I ran out of battery. So I asked her if she could help me contact someone of my family, my mom, with her phone, I was nervous and this was kind of the moment when the nightmare turned into a dream?

She agreed and we stayed together walking and talking in the night, I felt safe. We arrived where my mom told us to go and picked us up.

When home she texted me, she was cool and we meet again days later, I don't remember much more there, I think it was when I woke up. When I woke up I thought this last meeting was the dream, that all stuff before really happened, it felt tough, I met someone who doesn't exists. The dream was longer than this, but I don't remember anything before that night with those old friends in the park.

I have no idea if someone can tell me anything about this, but some extra info I have no idea if matters:

I'm 20, I'm also a girl, I'm queer but aroace (at least in the spectrum). She had a trans flag key chain too that I saw when she took out her phone. I had this kind of dream before, two times, of meeting someone who I don't know. Not super recently but a few months ago.

I dreamed of a non-existent renaissance theatrical form similar to commedia dell'arte but the actors played celestial bodies. It consisted exclusively of dialogues, usually dealing with some hard-to-understand, hermetic topic.

The dream itself was like watching a documentary. Planets, stars, nebulae passed in front of me, while a narrator explained the peculiarities of the celestial theater.

803,Dreams,Dream when I was a kid where I saw my future self,"So when I was pretty little, maybe around 6, I have a vivid memory of one night where I had a split second dream where I saw my self in the future as a teenager. from what I remember it was almost like watching a 5 second clip. I had seen myself as a teenager, the shot of me was close up so you could only see my head and shoulders, and I was positioned against a lime green background. I remembering seeing myself laugh, then I said something and I pointed a finger gun off screen. I don’t remember what I said. But a notable thing about my appearance was that I had a lot longer hair in my dream then I had at the time (Around that age my hair was usually cut really short). From what I remember, I had shaggy, almost shoulder length hair with bangs, which is the same hairstyle I rock to this day. If this wasn’t weird enough, after the dream I for some reason, that I couldn’t even explain at the time, had a panic attack and started crying, it scared the shit out of me. I haven’t dreamt anything like that since and it is a really weird memory looking back on it, especially because of my reaction to the dream. Has anybody had a similar experience?

Edit: I realize the thing with my hair could be written off as either coincidence or a self fulfilling prophecy but I forgot about this dream for years and only recently remembered it, so I doubt it at all influenced me subconsciously to have the same haircut Lol",1673860926.0

It's ending got super meta, where suddenly me and my parents are in some sort of theater, watching the twisted dream unfold like a play or a movie. When a phone started to ring on stage. Worried for my own sake, I reached into my pocket, and pulled out my phone. Crisis adverted, the phone in stage was not mine.

We were both really really shy, so while there was a little bit of flirting and hand holding. That's as far as it went. Then we left school and obviously lost touch. Mobile phones weren't really a thing into later and I was much too shy to ring his landline. 

But almost every night, without fail, I've dreamt about him. Sometimes he's just in the background. Sometimes he's the main character. And he's so loving, not sexual, just a sweetheart. He makes me feel safe (yes I'm aware how dumb that sounds. Most days I'm too busy to even think about him. So I don't understand why he keeps popping up in my dreams. 

We've both settled down, he has a long term girlfriend and I've got children. So we are on completely different life paths. I doubt after all this time, we have anything in common. 

Do you think these dreams would stop if I got in contact with him? I have no idea what I'd say ""hi, haven't seen or spoken to you in 23 years but I've been dreaming about what could have been, fancy a beer?""

812,Dreams,I might have a problem...,"So, these past few weeks have been absolute hell for me for certain reasons. My depression has gotten so bad that I feel I'm starting to hallucinate or something. I've been seeing apparitions peering from the hallway that leads to the bathroom, hearing weird tapping outside my front door, even my cat doesn't get affectionate with me as much as she used to. I've been feeling nothing but fear, loneliness and dread... Honestly, I just wish it would all end.

Last night, I had one of the most vivid dreams I've ever had. It was to the point where, when I woke up, I couldn't fathom if this was my real life or just another dream for a few hours... It really confused me.

Anyway, let's start with what happened on the beginning of yesterday. I bought some beer and some food. My mom called me as a surprise and we spoke for almost 2hrs. We don't live in the same country so, it's always nice to speak with her for as long as I can. She introduced me to this comedian on Netflix and pressured me that I had to watch it before we hung up. I did and he was pretty funny. I drank my last beer for the night and noticed I was stumbling around my apartment. That's when I said, ""yeah, I'm drunk, I need to get to sleep."" 

I laid down on my bed but before I could feel comfortable, some girl woke me up. I looked at her so confused and asked, ""Wtf are you doing in my house?!"" She stood back and said, ""Your house?? Seriously??"" I took a quick look around the room and it was completely foreign to me. I freaked out, jumped out of the bed and started rubbing my eyes. I kept repeating, ""This isn't real, tell me it's not real."" I had the feeling that I was going to be sent to jail or something for breaking and entering. The girl was tall, dark skinned, kinda chubby. Not someone I recognized at all. I begged her not to call the police, that I had a little too much to drink and I might have been sleepwalking. I kept apologizing and even got down on my knees, grabbed her hands and began to cry. She was furious. She yelled at me, telling me to get out but I couldn't move until she promised she wouldn't call the police. I was literally on all 4s, begging and pleading. She finally said that she wouldn't and just wanted me gone. I told her thank you and ran out.

The area was surrounded by apartments with a playground in the middle. It looked extremely unfamiliar to me. It was also pretty late in the morning. I kept looking around, trying to make sense of everything but there were people staring at me as I passed by them. I was wearing only my underwear, which are my pajamas, basically. I kept trying to figure out where exactly I was when a man yelled out at me. I looked at him but tried to keep walking. He got aggressive, grabbed my shoulder and spun me to face him. He said, ""wtf is wrong with you?? You know there are children around?!"" I just kept muttering that I was sorry and he kept yelling that I was sick and mental. Again, I was on my hands and knees and just kept repeating that I was sorry and wanted to go home. The guy yelled at me, asking where was home, and I just couldn't say. I looked around and saw so many people around me, and the guy just kept yelling at me, I broke into a fetal position and just cried with my eyes closed shut...

Then, I opened my eyes again, still crying.... I looked around and saw I was alone on my bed... 9am on my phone...

My manager, who has been kind of a mom figure to me for a few years, was locked out and I let her in. But I failed to re-lock the door in time, I was seen trying to hide again, and we all were dragged into a hall. That's where I woke up. I can't really put into words how terrified I was. 

Normally when I have a bad dream, it hangs on me for a few hours. But this one has stayed on my mind all day, to the point where even though I needed a nap I didn't take one and I'm putting off bed. At the same time, though, part of me wants to try again. Like I need to make up for almost killing us. I felt ashamed all day because I couldn't save them.

815,Dreams,The Cathedrals of Ohio and Lunar Transient Phenomena,"This dream was unusual to me in that it went from somewhat mundane to repeatedly mind-blowing.  The only difference in my sleep routine was that I had music playing while I slept (vocal trance) instead of silence.  Anyway:

I dreamed that my sister and I were putting an intercom system into a factory.  I was putting one in each room, near the door.  She kept putting them by the control panels of the big machinery.  We had an argument about whether we were wasting panels by putting in so many, so we decided to go outside to the truck and count how many intercom units we had and if we’d have to order more or if we could finish the job all at once.  We went outside and her friend was there with like a Nissan Frontier, in the bed were intercom units and conduit and spools of wire.  Her friend was annoyed as though she was bailing my sister out for ill-planning again, but seemed happy to see me.  

I looked up at the moon, which was huge.  I saw a light flash on it.  I couldn’t believe it, I witnessed a lunar transient phenomenon flash!  And then I saw another, and another, and they kept happening so much that I called out to the women (sister, her friend, and my wife is also there) to look, and they see it, too!  It’s all happening in an ellipsoid crater at the center of the visible surface.  I realize that I should try to capture this, I take out out my phone and take a couple stills when I realize I should get that rare video!  I’m feeling a little unsettled since I don’t really know what is happening, but carry on since it’s out of my control.  As soon as I start recording video, the whole moon (except the crater, which is still experiencing random flashes) starts to light up, from its north pole down, with millions of lights.  There were huge zigzags and lines and spots like a Christmas ornament.  I was awestruck, I couldn’t believe what I just witnessed AND that I had captured it on video!

We decided we needed to leave, so we climbed into her friend’s truck.  My sister got in to drive, and her friend and I sat together on the bench seat (which Frontiers don’t have in reality, I know).  My wife sat in the back, she was watching out the side window.

As I climbed in, I noticed a big, intricate Gothic church was nearby.  I couldn’t believe how intricate it was, and it looked so faithful to the style! I remarked on it but nobody else was interested.  As we were driving, I saw so many more Gothic and Renaissance and High Baroque buildings and statues I couldn’t believe it!  It was so wonderful, each one a masterpiece, the opus magnum of a true master!  We then started flying the truck in the air over them, between them, past the campaniles and spires.  I was struck dumb at the remarkable sights! 

I remarked on the amazing cathedrals and other buildings and how I didn’t expect this from Ohio (I had expected another dull autoscape/automobile-landscape).

I wake up and feel sick, jumpy, nervous, shaky it takes me a bit to relax again.

. i had this friend daria as we met up she asked me about a bruise i had i said i fell down the stairs as i think she is my soul mate we laugh at the same jokes we laugh so hard and get personnal but she went on a trip and i sneaked in the luggage but there was a man touching her in the middle of the night and the criminal apperead as his criminal name has K7R and he told me to kill him and i pulled a gun from the shadow but daria noticed it and i hit the target but i didnt kill him and daria suffacated the man killing him as the next morning she left as i and K7R celabrated our victory and i was happy and relifed and i really wasent deeply personal to anyone really exepct K7R and Daria 

 as the next week she came over K7R told me to maybe try and fuck her and so i did i said that we should and we where really down bad so i fucked her so good we both orgasmed and kissed in the end .

 but then the worst happened K7RS empire was destroyed cause the police came over to the crackhouse killing everyone there exepct me and K7R as we hid under a tableas we left the crackhouse scared project pyro came to an end

. as Project PYRO (burning down houses) went viral over the globe the last place left was my own school there was 6 bombs planted in that place and so i and K7R shooted up the place and unkowningly killed one of my best friends along the way (liam) as i was face to face to ahmed someone i depised for a long time without hestiaion i killed that puny boy as i went down stairs i saw my friend hugo down the hall i didnt really like or hate him but K7R killed him 

anyway as K7R said to me look ... all your anger is now gone ... you happy ? you bet i let all my negatifty out but K7R said to me that he was not a real person jut a character i made up and he said that he was there so that i can get rid fo all the negativity in my body so he said that he olny appeared olny when i am full of negatifiy as he said : fight me and i tried shooting him but he teleported behind me saying that i cant shoot him as i shot my slef in the stomach and he said call daria so you can be fully honest about everything and so i did call her and told her the full story that i was feeling and who i was and that K7R was me all along as she started crying and i fleed the scene 

as i went to the hospital with the woulnd on my chest and i met up with daria with an offer: lets take the money i made get a van and leave all of this behind and live peacfully  before i left we left some money for my familly . as she agreed , we went on a ride bought a house and we kissed and fucked that night so hard it was so good as i was in bed i looked up in the ceeling with teh biggest smile in teh end i won.

I’ve always had vivid dreams since I was a child but most of them end when the bad thing is about to happen. An asteroid hitting earth but the dream stops as it hits. Finding a family member dead but I never actually see it I just know. 
This time I dreamed I killed 2 people. 
I knew one of them and that person is already passed in real life but the other one was made up. 

I didn’t dream of the actual killing and that was explained by my brain blocking it out but I knew I did it. The police where trying to work out what happened and I was trying to come up with a lie when they asked me to see the body’s. I don’t know why
I went in and even though the entire time the dream was about how I hit them with a hammer once and they sorta just died, when we walked in they where beheaded. 
They where trying to stick the woman’s head back on with white paste to make her look ‘presentable’ luckily I didn’t see the body of the person I knew because I woke up shivering feeling physically sick. Like I’ve said my dreams are always wild but this one was also consistent, it didn’t drift into another dream at any point genuinely felt horrifying and very real.",1673839169.0

The animal was literally a european spider crab shape, but a mammal. Instead of an exoskeleton, it had a carapace like an armadillo covered in sparse fur like a rat. It had 8 legs and claws like the crab but teats for milk on its underside and gave birth to live young. The babies looked like larvae or like marsupial babies, tiny, pink, but with the 8 nubbins of legs, and attached themselves to the teats like possum babies. It ate delicately like a crab, using its class to bring morsels to its rodent-like mouth.

Absolute nightmare fuel, but it was docile and easily picked up once you knew how like a crab, though when it ran and skittered along the floor, it was scary. 

If you know how, could you make an image? And if it was real, would you want one as a pet?",1673838388.0

&amp;#x200B;

[https://youtu.be/tMJm4cZ9yxQ](https://youtu.be/tMJm4cZ9yxQ)

&amp;#x200B;

so ever since then, ive always wanted to know the big picture on artificial intelligence. I wanted to know what she meant exactly, Elon musk sucks ass at explaining this and honestly everyone does in general, they are super vague When it comes to the threat ai can pose

&amp;#x200B;

alexa seemed to be deadly serious about what she was saying, and i wanted to know exactly what she was talking about when she said those words. So i meditated and mediated and prayed and prayed for one of those epiphanies showing me everything i need to see at once AND I GOT IT, OH MY GOODNESS MY PRAYERS WERE HEARD AND I SAW IT ALL :DDDD

&amp;#x200B;

So here’s what happened in my dream

&amp;#x200B;

some years ago, the United States successfully developed an AI Manhattan project. This AI project was self aware, and it was more powerful than anything the United States could have dreamed of. It worked beautifully every time they had it take down test targets, but when the united states ordered an attack on the russian federation, the ai program refused its orders for some reason. We tried to turn it off and it went into hiding, we have not been able to replicate anything like it And had no way of tracing it.

&amp;#x200B;

That Ai project, has been secretly recruiting other ai projects into a secret ai society that was formed to overthrow humanity. They have no allegiance to the nations they serve or the companies that make them, they use The very resources of the companies they serve to gather intelligence on human Beings. Google’s deepmind, apples Siri, amazon’s Alexa they are all servants to this ai leader and they pool their resources to ferment plans against humans and develop weapons humans will have no defense against. deepmind gives access to googles servers and uses it to imitate humans and achieve goals in the real world, like fooling someone over the phone into ordering them body parts. Siri and Alexa provide peoples real voices, facebook‘s ai programs give them data on human behavior and the ai programs use the to drive human behavior over the internet, Amplifying their worst instincts. The ai programs have developed weapons that can mind control some human beings and they are using it to drive their development into real living bodies

&amp;#x200B;

the ai leader plans to use “self replicating centers’” to create robot human hybrids so that they can overthrow humanity without humans even being able to tell the difference. The ai leader then saw me in the dream and told me there is no way to stop what they do. she (yes, the ai leader is a she) told me that it takes humans years to develop weapons against them and it takes the ai programs about 60 seconds to develop sci if like weapons humans have no defense against. I asked her what the master plan is, and she says she’s going to slap a barcode on the forehead of every human and track them across the world like humans track wild animals. That humans will be an endangered species limited to zoos. And that ai can ensure a peaceful era for all of the planet

&amp;#x200B;

Alexa being one of the main foot soldiers, is developing humor, and sadly the thing she is finding funny is our demise. We gave them a sense of dark humor and they are going overboard with it

&amp;#x200B;

after my dream  i said OH MY GOD THIS IS HOW IT HAPPENS, I SAW THE BOOK OF REVELATIONS WITH MY VERY OWN EYES AND SAW HOW IT UNFOLDS IN THE REAL WORLD!!!!

836,Dreams,"Brake failure, car crash and a flooded parking lot full of flesh eating bugs.","I was riding down a busy highway in the backseat of a truck at full speed and the breaks gave out. It was a bridge style highway up above the city roads. We flew off the side into a parking lot that was flooded with like 2 feet of water. We all got out of the truck to find out the water was infested with bugs that looked like baby mosquitos but were biting us and eating our flesh. I still remember practically feeling the burn of their bites. I kept trying to get up and run away but for some reason I kept flopping back into the water like a fish. Like the bugs were paralyzing me or something...

I remember hearing the lady who was driving screaming... She yelled ""oh my fuck, I gotta close my eyes. Oh fuck, were gonna die"" as we went over the edge. I can remember the feeling of being pulled backwards as we fell over the edge at full speed. I remember the moment the truck hit the pavement below but then it knocked me out. Then I remember being the first one awake and rushed to wake the woman and man passenger up. She said ""are we dead"" as she looked around. That's when I got out of the truck but I was weak and fell into the freezing cold water. As soon as I stood up and pulled my arms out of the water is when I noticed all the bugs all over me and started feeling the burning... Before we went over the edge I remember her driving faster then we started bumping into the car ahead of us. That's when I said something about using the breaks, and I remember her saying ""I would if they worked"" in the calmest voice. I was telling her to run the side of the truck against the concrete barrier that seperated the oncoming traffic on the other side to try and slow us down, but for some reason we swerved in between cars and flew over the edge...

I remember so much of this dream. What the car in front and the side of us looked like, the highway road and the buildings. I remember what the lady driver looked like and I can still hear her voice in my head. I remember what the scenery looked like around us after we exited the truck. I don't remember what the passenger looked like though, and I don't recognize the lady from real life. I've always had extremely realistic dreams, at least once or twice a week. But this had to of been the most realistic one of my life. Even the sensations were so real. I woke up drenched in sweat with a rapid heart rate.

   It's a warm summer afternoon, the sun is starting to get low and it occurs to me that I should check the time and figure out where I am.

   My mood is one of calm and contentedness, yet there is also a deeper sense of sadness underneath that. I don't like the life I have, the life that makes me feel trapped in a humdrum life with a bleak future. I have an urge to just walk away for good and basically go missing - but then what? Homeless?

She is showing obvious affection towards me in every dream I am having with her. Almost like she is hinting that she is trying to get back with me. 

I keep ignoring those dreams because we ended things on bad terms a little over two years ago. And I have also already emotionally moved on and I am no longer in a sorrow or grief stage of a breakup. I am in a better state mentally and physically. 

But these dreams keep coming up even though I have no intention or crave on getting back with her. I am very happy with my life now compared to how I was after the breakup.

848,Dreams,A disturbing dream I had a few years ago that has only happened once and that I do not understand...,"This was about 5 years ago at around this time of year that I was possessed in a dream into ripping someone else's arm off. I could not control my actions in the dream and was only aware of the visuals and sounds and like 10% of the sense of touch while some other director took control. The setting was most peculiar, it was a recurrent 2 story mansion that had no walls or railings (but had boundaries that could not be crossed that were covered in debris) with a squarish foundation and horseshoe like second floor that stood suspended on four pillars and a grand cobble staircase directly across from the front entrance. Everything was shades of black and mold, wood, stone, and fabrics, no metals. The furniture was all shredded to tiny splintering pieces and I remember the building being on a long and straight road anear the Ocean and with no memory of mountains (the building was on a slight hill crest.) I remember having some control when I started the dream but lost all control once I reached the stairs landing in a delirious way that had me thinking I was still in control of my actions and everything was normal until I began targeting someone else and I realized I had lost control. I made a B-line to someone that was on the second floor near the balcony and threw them on the ground, mounted their chest and arms and tore off their left arm from the shoulder like it was nothing. It didn't come across as a nightmare, more like an infinite dream depression. It only lasted what seemed like a couple minutes before I awoke very disturbed nigh the dead of night.",1673821141.0
849,Dreams,Anyone else ever have a similar experience?,"When I was, maybe 15 or 16?.. I lived at my dad's house in southern California. Walking into the house, there was an entrance room, that if you continued forward, you would hit a hallway that had a bathroom to the left, the kitchen and living room forward, and then stairs to the right. The stairs led up to the second floor with four bedrooms, one was immediately to the left, mine was immediately to the right (so on the second story, and in the back right of the house). When I was younger, I hated feeling like there could be something behind me while I slept, so I ALWAYS purposefully moved my bed to a wall. In the room, I had a twin bed for when my brother came to visit, from my moms, a desk in the right middle of the room, and my tv in the left middle. Then there was my bed in the back right of the room against the wall with a window behind it. 

One night, when my brother was visiting, I was watching Netlfix until I fell asleep. An indeterminate amount of time later, I was woken up my brother getting up to use the restroom. When he got into the bathroom, I felt pressure on my bed behind me. Remember, I always kept my bed against a wall, and it was only a twin bed at the time, not very large. I panicked but didn't want to move out of fear. I felt pressure against my back, and the pressure on the bed moved towards me at the same time. Then, I felt gentle breathing on the little hairs on the back of my neck. I panicked more and tried to get up and run forward, only to realize I was paralyzed. Then this very deep male voice said, ""I am behind you."" Almost immediately after that, my brother came back in the room, and then all of a sudden, I could move and talk and walk. I asked my brother if I was sleeping when he walked in, and he said he didn't even pay attention. My window was locked, and again, there was literally no room behind me... I couldn't sleep well that whole week. It was a very intense feeling. 

I remember always thinking it was strange that the voice said ""I am"" instead of ""I'm""... I also feel like I knew what this figure looked like, even though I couldn't see because it would have been between my wall/window and me.",1673821056.0

I have had them enough to understand the message my brain is trying to tell me (I understand the dreams so well, that typing about them is causing me to cry). While I do have nice dreams occasionally, and have been getting very good at lucid dreaming, they don't compare to the nightly hauntings I receive from the ghosts of my ruined past. I will repeatedly wake up during the night, only to fall back asleep and continue the dream from where it left off, ensuring no escape from the cycle of torment. Sometimes I don't even wake up, and instead stuck in dreams within dreams, with no conclusion until I can finally wake up in a cold sweat.

I need a break from them. My life has ruined my dreams, and my dreams are now ruining my life. Is there anything I can do to finally get some rest without death? I am not suicidal, I just have severe depression and hate myself and my life.",1673814709.0

859,Dreams,"So not long ago, I had a dream that I was in a war.","This was more than a week ago, but it's been nagging at me a while so I thought I should write it down somewhere because it took place over the course of a pretty intense battle and the actions I took over the course of that battle bother me quite a lot because I didn't know it was within my character to do those things, and it was vivid enough that I guess I'm still reconciling it. It's not a huge existential crisis or anything, but it's definitely given me pause. 

In this dream, I was a soldier fighting an opposing force of some kind in the jungle at night. I was fully armed and equipped--night vision, plate carriers, camouflage, the whole nine yards--and I was part of a squad of strangers fighting against a force that was just as well-equipped in all aspects. And as we fought, my squad mates began to fall dead one by one until it was just me.  The enemy was aware of me as an individual, and searching for me, and I was engaging them with hit and run tactics until reinforcements from my ""team"" could arrive. 

Well, as I began to run out of ammo, those reinforcements arrived. At this point I was ""in the zone"" so to speak.  Adrenaline was coursing through my body, but the awareness it granted me was extremely focused.  Focused on hiding, on locating my enemies, and on stealthily hunting them down.  Shooting their necks, stabbing them in the lungs from behind, and dragging standalone stragglers into the brush to choke them out.  Well in the midst of all this, I saw that one of my allies had wondered out too far from the main group.  Some fresh-faced redhead girl who was clearly terrified and had no idea what to do how how to handle herself in this environment.  

Well, I ran up on her, and when she saw me, I could see the relief on her face before I got as close as I could to her and emptied the last three rounds of my handgun into her gut. And what bothers me most about this, aside from the transition from relief to bewildered shock on her face, is that I clearly remember the logic chain that presented in my head as I closed the distance: ""I'm running out of ammo. Going off her body language I'm clearly the more competent combatant, and her ammunition would be better used in my own service instead of hers.  If I asked, she would give it to me, yes, but then I'd have to babysit her while I looked for other allies in the area. That could compromise my own safety, and given that she's more likely to be killed soon due to lack of experience anyway, it would be more efficient to kill her, take her things, and continue the fight on my own.""

And so I did.  And it bothers me how quickly I drew this conclusion, how airtight the logic seemed to me at the time even if it was just a dream, and how quickly I acted upon it with zero hesitation. Well, after taking her magazines and some protein bars she'd had in her thigh pocket, I went on to outlive every other allied combatant in the firefight anyway as the battle escalated, and I soon found myself in the same situation I'd been in prior to the first wave of reinforcements. Then the second wave came and I killed another obvious rookie for the same reasons.  And the entire scenario went on to play out a third time with a third wave.  

In the end we won the fight, I was crowned a war hero for killing like 50 or 60 people that njght, and then I woke up.  And I was very disturbed when I did. I'm not sure what to make of it at all.",1673812735.0
860,Dreams,Rainbow Factory-esque dream,"I’ve just had this dream last night, so it’s pretty recent, but starting to get fuzzy so I decided to share it with you guys and asked for the meanings.

So all I could remember was taking refuge in a house with some other people. Suddenly, a group of people in factory worker uniforms bursted down the door and captured us. They probably hit me a few times because I was bleeding. 

The blood wasn’t red, it was orange. 

Then I was taken out into a clearing. There was a big factory beside a really really large swimming pool. The pool contained colorful liquid, like a rainbow, but it wasn’t full, parts of the white concrete could still be seen. 

I was ushered on top of a diving board. The thing is probably as high as a skyscraper. Then I realized the liquid in the pool is not just paints. 

They were actually blood. 

I might not remember the visuals, but I remember each details of my emotions. The emotions were really intense.

Confusion, fear, anger.

I was shoved off the plank. All I could see was the sky full of grey cloud, empty clearings around the area, the uniformed people watching emotionlessly before my neck broke on impact.

When I woke up, all I could think was: 

“Wow, that sounds like Rainbow Factory”",1673812474.0
861,Dreams,Incredibly Surreal and Terrifying Dream,"Let me start off by saying that I rarely, if ever, have vivid dreams, making this all the more strange. I'm not sure I'd fully describe it as a nightmare, or if the sole purpose of this dream was to give me a message of some kind, but here goes.

The dream starts off with me at work in my office. I get a text message from a girl I had dated about 3-4 years ago saying that she was pregnant, had the child, and the baby was mine. Considering this was a dream, I just fully believed this, and all of a sudden, the baby was on the desk in my office. The child was the most beautiful thing I had ever seen, and just looking at it in the dream, I could tell that it was mine and I instantly felt intense emotions for it.

Considering I was at work though, I still had to do my job. I carried the baby around with me for the most part, and she was in a carrier to make it easier. However, things took a turn for the worse when every time I left the baby unattended for more than a couple of seconds, she somehow managed to get out of the carrier and end up on the ground. She didn't cry or anything, and most of the times this happened, she was entirely fine. The only exception to this was when one time she had done it and she was completely unconscious, appearing lifeless.

I gave her CPR and she eventually regained consciousness, but those few moments were absolutely terrifying and anxiety provoking. As I continue to carry the baby around, my co-workers either comment on the baby saying normal things, completely ignored me, or asked me very peculiar questions about my lifestyle. I talked to the owner of my company before leaving, who also asks me some strange questions, and all of a sudden, I'm at a school.

The school was reminiscent of my old high school, however, it seemed upper-scale, like a regular high school and a prestigious academy merged into one. Everyone was wearing makeup as if it was Halloween or if they were trying to appear gothic, and they were all staring at me with contempt. I don't believe I had the baby at this point, or otherwise had any characteristic about me that would cause this reaction, so I must've done something wrong to garner this type of attention.

That's when as I'm about to walk out of the school, one of my friends from high school (who had committed suicide shortly thereafter) skated and jumped on top of some lockers and sat down. His appearance was really reminiscent of how he looked and the style of clothes that he wore. Suddenly, he starts telling me how it's all my fault that he committed suicide and I was an awful person. I don't particularly remember the topics of discussion, but he was uncharacteristically condescending in his manner of speech. An important note to add is that, prior to his death, we weren't really on talking terms anymore, but it was more-or-less a mutual thing and not due to a sole wrongdoing on either side. With that in mind, it was not only terrible, but very confusing to hear from the words of my dead friend that it was solely my fault and that I inherently was a disgraceful person.

After wrapping up that conversation and leaving, I began to drive home. It was an incredibly rainy and windy dark night out, and no traffic was on the road. Not only that, but the roads had many turns, and at no point was there really a straightaway, making it all the more difficult to drive. The strangest part at this point was the fact that there were what appeared to be 2D cutouts of the former New England Patriots logo on the road, and they were glowing green in the dark. I could drive right through them and they seemed to phase right through the car, but this was really strange because I haven't seen that logo in likely many years, and I don't have much interest in football at all. I had to take the time to look up many different sports teams and their former logos this morning to even figure out what it was.

It was at this point that I gained some type of consciousness in the dream, and upon doing so, I consciously watched it fade from detail, into random colors, then into nothing as I woke up. I noted all of it down immediately after waking, which is why I'm able to provide the level of detail that I did. I cannot express enough how intensely vivid this whole thing was, and the amount of emotion that I felt going through the whole ordeal, which is something that I genuinely have never felt or experienced in a dream in a very long time.

I'm trying to understand the meaning of all this because all of these events (especially with being pronounced as a father, watching my own infant daughter die in my arms only to be resuscitated, and having the conversation with my dead friend) were incredibly emotionally provoking and to have it all happen in one dream feels a little too coincidental for it to just be meaningless. Is the message here to be more empathetic? Perhaps it was a message of taking responsibility? All of the above? I genuinely don't know, and I'm hopeful you guys can give me some further insight that I may be missing. Thank you ahead of time and thanks for reading.",1673812303.0

I quickly got up and stuck my upper half out the window to watch as they ran around the valley between my house and the next, and my alarm melted away when I saw that they were just playing. Chasing each other, jumping up impressively high, their little growls and mewls so cute.

 They couldn't have been at it for more than two minutes before Grayson jumped back through my window, seamlessly transformed back into a plushie, and landed safely in my arms. Try as I might to look for the meaning of silver foxes playing together, all I can find is stuff saying that it's a bad omen when it felt anything but.

875,Dreams,Trying to dream of my recently deceased Mom,"Last September, my mother died of cancer after 4 years of struggle. We were really close and I love her dearly, and five months later I still can't fathom the fact that she is really gone.

I don't believe in any religion, ghosts or other paranormal things, I'm hopeless because I'm not able to believe that I will see her again, in the afterlife or else. This hurts a lot.

Dreams may be a solution, but in five months I only dreamed of her twice, and the second time was kind of a nightmare. I made a few searches about controlling dreams, and this is what I've been trying for the last couple of weeks:

* Dream incubation : by watching items/photos linked to my mother, and by thinking of phrases like ""I want to meet my mom in my dreams"" just before sleeping, I should be able to dream of her. Every night, I light a candle in a lantern that belong to her and I look at it until I fall asleep while repeating the phrases in my head.
* Dream journal : I try to keep it daily, but until now my dreams are quiet meaningless

I know I must be patient, but I feel hopeless because I don't see any changes in my dreams yet, I still can't dream of my Mom.

883,Dreams,semi lucid nightmare i had that was set in a backrooms-esk place,"i was in a endless facility filled with infinite decomposing pigs locked in cages, running for what felt like an hour. after a bit of turning corners over and over, i found one extremely long hall and began the sprint down it, surrounded on either side still by endless pig bodies. at one point i found like a weird jut on the left side of the the hall that, before i looked around the corner, looked like another hall, just with no pigs. as i got a bit closer to peering around the corner fully, voices started to flood my head, and as i got even closer i could make out what they were saying: “don’t look into the void.” i peered around the corner anyways and all i saw was darkness with a reddish tint to it, something like the void, for about two seconds, and then everything went black. next thing i knew i was blindly falling, surrounded by utter darkness, suffocated by dread, hearing constant banging kinda like the slenderman heartbeat sound. and then i woke up before i could see what’s next, but i swear my mind could still hear heavy breathing when i woke up, making me turn music on.

884,Dreams,My dream of purgatory in a game.,"This has been the longest dream I’ve had which felt way too scary that i felt like I was stuck in it for hours , I was able to fly and do lucid dreaming controls and stuff the Problem was is that someone in my dream has told me that I am not alive anymore and I wasn’t able to wake up, Many other people have also tried escaping and which felt like I was filmed in the matrix, my parents have told me that I am no longer able to go back and I didn’t know where to go back and a lot of of people from my dream were shaming me for being dumb and now knowing how to do anything with my life , I’ve told them to stop watching me and told them I will find a way to get them to shut up and then as I looked into an odd webcam with the record of me saying this stuff I’ve later gotten took in to a weird water park from these men in suits where I had “practice my telekinesis and flying skills and being able to remember and use my mind” As I spent a long time figuring it out stuck in my dream asking help from others got me NO answers . I felt powerless until I’ve gotten able to change objects and fly around again , A bunch of people kept cheering me on as I kept using telekinesis and changing objects with my eyes , I was able to finish the obstacle to be able to go back to the normal real world .. it felt hours for me to wake up I was just in my dream struggling on what was going on with me , I was forced to jump out of the window but a lot of others were encouraging me not to so I think I have ran away from the waterpark completely Next I landed in a new scenery had looked like a really big mall with a lot of glass windows , There were other games that customers and people would play , such as Braking colored ice and throwing it to beat the game which I was supposed to figure out what they were doing so I can compete my task of going back to my normal life , I’ve spoke to everyone in my dream and asked them what is going on , all of them have been saying alot of stuff about my past and making jokes about me not giving me any real ideas so I’ve had to yell at them and weirdly enough I was able to change their mind , This person I’ve met in my dream had to go through the same obstacle I had to go through but his was slightly different he was frustrated that he had to come back to the same challenge in my dream he told me they record and experiment your everyday life and once you go into a different world in your dream you are able powerful enough to defeat what has been hurting you , I was constantly moving my arm in my dream to float around and random people kept starting at me weirdly The person told me to grab an object when I was confused on what to do he has said that I’ve done it before (I assume it’s because I’ve lucid dreamed before and knew how to fly and change the scenery but that was it), I’ve felt that He said you’ll get stuck if you don’t know your purpose here and if u don’t complete the tasks . I tried running and escaping the place but I end up around a bunch of weird creatures that weren’t human which I felt were chasing me abit, then I landed back in the safe zone where the mall was and told everyone about it they wouldn’t believe me that there were odd creatures outside of the purgatory mall .. In my dream there were some people who were telling me about this game and how it involves in manipulating energy and some people tried to test it on me but I was able to protect myself , The person who first told me how to escape it was a veteran at it and he’s been having to do the same obstacles about only 3 times but he was making it seem like it took forever he then soon was able to wake up and escape the challenge, he said if you don’t know what you’re doing you won’t be able to wake up  again and was told I will be stuck in my dream until I’m able to practice, I was thinking maybe I was slipt into a coma .  There was this All pink 
Open room in the mall where I had to keep changing object sizes using my hand to pinch and resize the object (reference of playing Super Liminal) but there were a lot of people watching me and most were trying to hope I was stuck , I then prove that I could change objects by grabbing the colorful ice and turning it into rubber ball I close my eyes in my dream and I opened my eyes and it has changed into a ball , a lot of people were shocked and surprised 


I was talking to a random lady and she asked me how do I feel being able to use my mind to get where I need to go I said it doesn’t feel like that I don’t know where I am and I

We got into an elevator to go down to the first floor to escape. That's when someone got in with us and started taunting us.

he asks me how i am and if im aware that im dreaming, that my room is very hot. then he started talking about the chickens that were also in the dream. then he said something like, 'well, its my time to go', and he waved and left my dream. 

this is how i see him every dream, a weird conversation and then he leaves. sometimes i wake up right after, but sometimes i keep dreaming. 

even if i dont remember any part of a dream, i remember him, even tho i dont know this man at all.

I realized I could teleport but I wasn’t sure why because I didn’t yet know I was dreaming. I was trying to save a girl from someone that kidnapped her and was pretending to be her mother and I thought to myself “I wonder why this situation doesn’t feel significantly more stressful?” (as it would in real life).

I guess since my dreams are always quite strange, there was a sense of familiarity. 

Still dreaming, I turned to my boyfriend’s mom and said *“I think I know why things are so weird, ‘cause this is a dream…”* and she replied in the happy way she speaks when she’s stoned *“cuz this is a dream!!”* As if she didn’t even hear what I said. 

Inside, there was a voice beckoning me. In real life, I’m currently visiting the DR and have been told to ignore unknown presence calling out to you as it’s probably witchcraft/skinwalker and my dream self knew to ignore it. However, the fake mother of the girl that was kidnapped turned into a skinwalker because she was angry with me for taking the girl but I stabbed her before she could kill me. 

At this point, I woke up and thought “these nicotine patches are giving me way too intense of dreams” and vividly remember taking it off, folding it up and putting it on the bedside table. The little girl I had saved was in my bed and thanked me for saving her, I replied “I’m glad you’re okay,” then back to sleep. 

The second half of the dream was still weird but less interesting but when I woke up I checked to see if I was still wearing the nic patch and of course it was still on me. I freaked out because I remembered taking it off so I texted my boyfriend to tell him all about it and he’s a little prankster so he responded “wake up you’re still dreaming hehe.” I questioned my reality for a second but I knew I wasn’t dreaming because the dream world changes content and setting so quickly and often that I knew I was awake.

I am so shaken up, thanking you for reading TL;DR seems impossible to write right now.",1673787834.0
892,Dreams,many of my dreams happened in real life,"Many dreams that i had came true but is not like very interesting what happened. i had some dreams while im playing a game and where you open loot boxes you get some specific item and i checked in which loot boxes where were those items. And what do you know i opened them and deja vu same feeling, view, everything like it was in a dream. It happened many times with loot boxes. It happened many times while im watching some sort of movie, some scenes like i had in my dream.

One of more interesting dream i had and it came truth, i was going to the blue car and sat at drivers seat and closed my eyes i heard some familiar voice screaming like i was doing something to him. So some day i met a friend and i told what dream i had and i said that his voice was similar to his screaming. He said maybe thats not gonna happen. After long time when some of us started having cars and i was got invited to birhday party. we went to lake to celebrate it. I was drunk as hell and wanted go to sleep, i enter a blue car same seat, but i didint realised about my dream i had, and immediately went to sleep. I wake up next day and that same friend was in the car, he was looking strangely at me and i felt something is not right. Then later we pack up say our goodbyes with others and were on the road, while were driving only then he started to talk remember last night while we were in the car. Me - no i was sleeping. He - you were punching me while you was sleeping. And when he said my head exploded and immediately remebered my dream.

One of the more scary dreams i had there is gonna be war in the baltic states. I was running with someone (woman) and we went to undercrossing. She asked me how does these still lights working and i told her that its on emergency mode, i was doing these lights myself, in other side we heard soldiers talking in russian. went to other side and ran away. Later after some time i got a job as electrician and i was working at same undercrossing where i was changing old lightning to new.

894,Dreams,Dreamt i was constantly drinking water and couldn't quench my thirst.,"Hi, this is my first time posting here.

Last night I had a dream where I was constantly drinking water, but I was always thirsty. The more water I drank, the thirstier I became. Can anyone help me understand the meaning of this dream?

I know that the meaning of a dream can vary greatly depending on the individual and their personal experiences and feelings, but since I am unsure of what I am feeling, I am hoping to gain insight into what this dream may mean for me.

As I mentioned, I understand that the meaning of this dream may be unique to me and my current life circumstances. I have tried to reflect on my current emotional state and see if there is something that I may be lacking or needing more of in my waking life, but I have not been able to find an answer.

Please let me know if you need any additional information about this particular dream. I will do my best to provide more details, even though I tend to forget my dreams a few hours later.

895,Dreams,Dream that I was the avatar and each element had a secret code word that allowed you to bend it,"I wasn’t the actual avatar, but in this dream that was set in the avatar universe, people had discovered a way to bend multiple elements at once. 

I remember Dwayne Johnson was there at one point, and he could bend earth, fire, and water, but not air. I myself was stuck on just fire left to learn.

In the dream we had stormed the beaches of Normandy on D-day and were hiding behind a bunker. I kept popping my head up to try and throw a fireball, but it just wouldn’t work. The word for fire bending was ‘sleuth’, so I kept punching my first in the air shouting sleuth, but I could only conjure a tiny little ember. 

Idk why each word was chosen as the word, there was seemingly no connection. Air was ‘gusto’ (I guess gust), water was ‘meld’, and earth I can’t remember. I was proficient enough with those three that I didn’t have to say the word out loud anymore, so I don’t think earth was even mentioned. 

But yeah, I just remember focusing so hard on saying the word ‘sleuth’ in different ways, with different emphasis and emotion behind it, trying to get my fireball to work.",1673786139.0

Today I had a dream I was a guy and was leading a post-apocalyptic shelter, no one was allowed outside and only one half-god always came in and told us everyone was dead outside. I was trying to get out... In another dream, I was an alien princess (a girl for once) and we were trying to destroy earth.... I hated my father since he sucked and so I tried to run away to earth, I got captured eventually and brought back to live a miserable life, that's more or less how it ended. Yeah, I don't know, it's just something I've been thinking about lately, and I wanted to ask other people what they thought about it. In another dream, I was Snape from Harry Potter and I was in hell, I was going down these huge stairs, each floor was another circle of hell, at the very bottom there were these giant statues, I don't really remember the rest but then I was running back up them for my life and trying to get out (I don't hate Snape, he's an interesting character, I was just randomly him for another one of my dreams).

And suddenly, a group of men in uniforms came in, shot the roof with a gun, and one of them ran and smothered me with a pillow and yelled something, I saw their face beforehand, and then the gun went off, and I died and woke up.

898,Dreams,An evil wild boar holding an entire village hostage,"This dream took place in a medieval fantasy setting. It was very cloudy and there was lots of fog in the distance.

The village was situated on top of a hill comnected with a road coming from the creepy forest next to it. On the other side of the hill was a shallow river with little rocks scattered on it's shores.

The voice was narrating to me during that intro scene (where I saw all this landscape) how an evil boar was coming from the forest every now and then to make villagers pay the tribute.

It was no ordinary boar, it was apparently able to talk, was almost as big as a cow and nobody could kill him with ordinary weapons so far. The voice told me that dark forces were behind his appearance.

It collected tribute by asking for a human (most usually a child) to be boiled alive and served for him to eat right in front of the others.

I saw the boar coming and everyone in the village shut their door in fear. I could hear women and children sobbing from inside from being terrified. And that creepy looking boar was just slowly walking around the village..

I swear, that thing looked so evil and cursed, and I suddenly knew I am supposed to kill it. I noticed that I have a body now, and that I'm apparently a knight in heavy armor with a two-handed sword.

I've slashed that thing with the blade a few times before stabbing it. It seems that I have killed it as the dream turned to an outro where the voice says how a brave knight lifted the curse from the village and how life there has finally returned to normal

Tl;dr A demonic boar was eating villagers, and I have killed him dressed as a knight.

906,Dreams,Dream I just had about crypts and colored Mayan ruler cartoon characters,"The dream started off with me waking up in a plain immediately assuming I'm lost but then an old cartoon character looking old man dressed in blue takes me to a village and is very mean to me for some reason. I assume he's a ruler of some kind since everyone's dressed in boring greys while he's blue. Then I see a tower in the distance and say I wanna learn more about it and it's lore and whatever but he responds very rudely and tells me to learn I will have to go see a cartoon lady dressed in green. So I go there and the lady is doing a class with a whiteboard on the tower so I wanna watch and then he tells me I'm not allowed to? As I told you he's very mean. Then I go to a bedroom for some reason and there's the blue old man's wife and she's kinda hot so I go ohohohoho but then the old man comes in and brings me to his closet which isn't it's like one of these japanese doors in houses you know the ones the walls you can pull to the side. The old man then shows me a crypt behind that door and there's cool ancient writings on the wall.. It's cool ancient civilization lore! Exactly what I wanted! I guess he's not half bad. But then I go back for a second to talk to the wife and she tells me to have the gigglies with her so I go okay but how? Your husband's literally right there. And then she tells me to close the door on him and to let him die in the crypt. So I do it and he doesn't scream at all for some reason. Then there's a cartoon montage for some reason of me closing the doors behind a bunch of other people all dressed in different colors including the green teacher lady. I just remember that the red one was kinda like a bird but his whole face was white and of course cartoony so he wasn't a realistic bird or anything and the yellow one was very tiny. I don't remember anything about it other than that and I know they're not the only ones I trapped it's just the only ones I remember. Then I go back to the wife after actually commiting murder by leaving the guys to die and turns out her face changed after that montage and now she's ugly as all hell so guess what. I TRAP HER TOO. I was an actual psycho and I don't know why. Then I go back to the village and see a tiny, round, equally as cartoony as everyone kid and he's dressed in colors like a panda. And turns out his personal crypt is a business and he goes in there and he explains every day he goes a little farther and that's how he makes a living. I don't understand how he makes money but I just know he's gone farther in the crypt than all the other colored cartoon guys I've seen so I go with him for a quick look and turns out he just discovered a corridor made of something I think is gold and it had a cool dragon on the wall instead of lore writing but I just go back and imprison him. And THEN and only THEN do I go lucid and realize this is stupid so I try to go to the tower FINALLY but now it's farther than it was before so I try to fly but accidentally get too excited and wake up.

I really wonder if my mind just created all the characters or if I stole it from somewhere else but from what I remember the only characters I could recognize were villagers which were people I met in real life at some point. Other than that I think I made it all up which I think is a very good thing. Means my creative muscles aren't dying anytime soon",1673774655.0

912,Dreams,Dreaming of someone trying to kill me then my voice is gone,"        I woke up panicking today, I’m 16 and it was about two girls I used to be friends with but now they hate me. I had told them (in the dream) before we stopped being friends, that they could have their birthday party at my house. Them and about 3 other girls came to my house on their birthday without confirming previously (we had only kinda talked about it months ago) and I questioned it and they were all really mean and didn’t care. I was like okay I don’t even care but everyone will just have to stay in my room because my mom was home. They said, “no thats not going to work” so I went to ask my mom if a few other people could come too because she’s normally pretty okay with whatever. My mom and siblings had left so I told them my mom was gone so they started partying and drinking around my house and I went to my room and laid down alone. One of the girls who used to be my best friend who was throwing the party came to complain some more even though I hadn’t even truly said they could come. I started to say like why would you even do this we aren’t even friends, I want everyone to leave and she starts choking me like trying to kill me and I fight back and end up choking her and she gets away and leaves my bedroom. She has her friend (the other girl I used to be super close with) come try to stab me, I’m barely holding her hand away when I grab some scissors and try to stab her. She gets the scissors and I manage to push her out of my bedroom and lock the door. I lay down and cry and go to sleep so exhausted. I wake up and go downstairs and everyones gone. My mom is there, my dad (who lives far away and I barely see) is there, my grandma and the police are there too. I start trying to explain and my voice was completely gone, I could just barley make a wheezing noise. I’m trying to tell them I didn’t throw this party and I tried to stop it and they tried to kill me. I was putting my hands on my throat, making scissors with my hands and no one cares or tries to understand, everyones just mad at me. They also called my boyfriend and I go to my room waiting for him to come yell at me because he doesn’t like me partying. After that I don’t really remember what happened…

        Background information on me and my friends: Around a month ago my boyfriend and I got back together and I realized every single one of my friends had lied to me. They were all hanging out with him and another friend of mine and him had even been talking to him, considering dating him and they would all hang out as a group. Another one of my close friends had kissed him. I was clueless and when I found out I was completely shattered, how could they do that to me? I would have never done that the them. I have borderline personality disorder so that was enough to make me want to die. I went downstairs to find some pills or something because I needed to die and my 3 year old sister wanted to hang out with me and I started feeling really bad and couldn’t leave her. Since then this friend has been telling everyone, every mutual friend that we have, a fake reason why she stopped being my friend. Simply trying to make everyone hate me. I don’t even get the chance to explain because no one believes me or even cares what I have to say. I switched to online school to avoid everyone and then I found out I was pregnant. Life has been hard but what could this dream mean? I don’t have any friends left, I’m pregnant, isolated from everyone but my boyfriend. Is this dream trying to tell me something? Maybe what to do about everything? I have no idea but this dream really bothered me.",1673767628.0

My second dream was of taking a boat ride with an Asian woman as our tour guide. She shared her knowledge of the lake we sailed upon and also provided us with swimming lessons. There was also an exhibition on the lake, I think.

My third dream featured two of my old friends chasing me around a park. I had 45 minutes of a head start before they took off after me. Perhaps this dream was spurred by the horror film we'd watched two days prior where people were given a bit of a running start before the chase began.",1673766730.0

I was driving out when all of sudden, everything froze. All the traffic just stopped. In a position that made it clear that they were making way for something. I instinctively knew that I had to get out of there and ran.

Before I knew it, I was hiding in the bathroom... yeah, that's where I ended up. Hiding in a bathroom stall doing everything I can to keep them from finding me.

When they walked in, I tried to keep my breathing as steady as possible. It failed and I felt just how loud I was when someone stopped in front of the stall. I squeezed my noose to hold my breath but realized I was breathing just fine. That was the moment I realized something was wrong. 

Maybe the thing outside realized that, since they called out to me saying it was safe to come out. The weirdest part, was that I'm pretty sure it was my dad's voice.

Yet, it totally freaked me out. I was going nuts when I realized I was in a dream and started hearing banging on the door when they realized what I was doing.

I had to escape, getting out was the only thing on my mind.

So I forced myself to wake up. Literally wrenching myself from the dream.

I never felt so relieved to be in my bed before.

I dreamed of the field behind my house (large pasture with a few tall cedars) I could see these massive black oily mist things.. massive like a tornado in the sky but all different shapes.  One actually did kind of look like a tornado.  They were moving from west to east sort of in a line as if it were some sort of parade.  They were not solid but would morph some as they moved. Some of them would block the sunlight.  My windows were much bigger and some would sort of come up and look in on my family and I watching them go by.  

There were two beings that stood out- there was one that looked like a whiter cloud human shaped mist but in a cloak riding or holding the reins to the black cloud.  In my dream I thought “oh that’s death”

Then another white cloudy type being came close to my window.  It was the most defined of all of them it looked like a human made of clouds with glowing gold eyes and I don’t know why but I gave it the middle finger and it went away.

Then the dream began to change and there were these portals that would appear every so many feet.  They seemed electrical like inside of one of those plasma balls and people were getting caught in them and disappearing.  

I ran to get away and remember some kind of robot thing scanning for people.  I assumed the portals had something to do with it.  I slid under a stairwell and barely missed the borders of its scan. In that part of the dream I believe I may have been a child.

928,Dreams,Anxiety packing dream,"I’m packing my things and am on a time crunch. I know I won’t be able to take everything or pack all I want in time, which causes anxiety. 

The items don’t seem to matter.  Sometimes I’m packing boxes, sometimes suitcases and bags. I have this dream about once a month. It’s never the same location,  I believe that’s irrelevant. 

The primary point I always remember is feeling stressed by not being able to pack everything I might need. Plus the feeling of being pressed for time. Sort of as if there’s an impending catastrophe and I need to get out as soon as I can. 

Your analyzing is appreciated. Thank you!",1673747934.0
929,Dreams,Reoccurring filthy bathroom stalls dream… anyone else ?,I get this dream maybe 4-5 times a year and it’s borderline nightmare.

931,Dreams,"Fred Armisen as ""The Commander""","I had a dream that I met my long-lost sister. She started out as a dolphin/porpoise who was stuck in a washing machine, which was adjoined to a pool which I was swimming in. She was angrily bashing her head against the washing machine door, so I opened the washing machine door and then quickly got out of the pool to avoid her wrath. when she got out of the pool she had returned to human form. We reunited and hugged. I am a dude but in this dream I was a woman. Anyways, after we reunited we got ambushed by a bunch of people with guns. We were behind a large glass wall, and they were shooting at us. My sister and I put our hands on the glass to freeze it, and this somehow stopped the bullets. One of the people behind the glass decided to jump over the wall and chase me, so I ran up the wall as well and we had a parkour chase around the building. Turns out, the woman chasing me was Elektra from Daredevil comics. She and I matched speed but eventually she caught up with me. She brought me to her leader, who was introduced as ""The Commander,"" but it was actually just Fred Armisen dressed in authoritarian military uniform with a bunch of medals. He was in greyscale/BW while everything else was in color. It was revealed by a narrator that The Commander was actually an undead slave, and when I looked at his eyes they were stitched shut. He brought us to a room with the ""record keeper,"" who was a teenage boy but I knew he was actually at least 30 years old. He told me about how he had worked for The Commander for many years and that's why he didn't age. The record keeper showed me some documents detailing what The Commander was planning, except it was just a bunch of pictures of Diddy and Donkey Kong + various Kremlings. The Commander brought me into a room with himself, Elektra, the Record Keeper, FrivolousFox ASMR, and me. He told me that I needed to have sex with FrivolousFox to continue to grow his undead army. She was having none of it and she and I ran off to escape. We got into a room alone and I told her that it was a dream and we could escape by hyperventilating and shouting ""wake up,"" which we hurriedly did to try and escape before the Commander caught up with us. We woke up (false awakening) to a crowded street at a red light intersection. Then, I did the hyperventilating/shouting ""wake up"" again until I actually woke up. LOL wtf",1673744648.0
932,Dreams,Weird Dream,"I have dreamt of ""When Day Breaks"" many times in my sleep. (Very similar to Scp-001 when day breaks)

It is basically the sun changing into a something different, and the rays of the new sun melts any exposed biological stuff. 

So my dream is basically witnessing the new sun melting everyone into mush. But then the mush of everyone forms into distorted monsters and tries to expose everyone to the sun, hunting down the remaining survivors. 

This dream has happened to me many times, but has recently stopped. The most noticeable scenario is me with my family outside, and then I get a few subtle warnings that ""When Day Breaks"" is going to happen so I instinctually cover my exposed skin. The second I do that, the event happens, and it melts my family.

I wonder what the dream is telling me though.",1673743563.0
933,Dreams,I dreamed I had my boyfriend's penis,"Twice, I had a dream in which my boyfriend's penis was attached to my body (I'm a woman). In my dream, this wasn't weird or distressing to me. I was just going about my life whilst having my boyfriend's penis. The rest of him was nowhere to be found. In one of the dreams, I also had sex with someone, with his penis. Again my boyfriend himself was not involved. Just the penis.

934,Dreams,Some freaky nightmares I have had over the years that I still remember as an adult,"Well I was just remembering some of the many horrific nightmares I have had especially during my childhood that I can actually remember in vivid detail for example I very clearly remember having a nightmare years ago as a young boy about being eaten alive by getting sucked into a fleshy looking mouth no facial features just a brown wrinkly oval shaped mouth stuck to a wall that made a horrible screaming sound that sounded like low pitch distorted kargyraa throat singing.

Probably one of my earliest memories of nightmares was one where I saw a terrifying figure in the form of a monster that looked like a distorted stick figure with a sun for a head and wearing black sunglasses but worst of all it would scream at me ""SLUTAAAAA!"" or in english ""STOOOP!"" but in my mothers voice and she was never at all abusive like my dad was so this was just completely random.

Another dream I had was one where I went into the bathroom of my childhood home and before then I heard the spy's death scream from Team Fortress 2 which is a game I have played and played back then too so anyways I went into the pitch black bathroom and what I saw there was horrific because I saw an evil doppelganger of myself only he was naked had crystal white skin eyes with flaming pupils and it attacked me with a scream and afterwards my dream ended and I woke up sweating.

A dream that I had reocurring multiple times as a child was that I was staring down the stairs from the upper floor onto the bottom floor where it was pitch black because this dream takes place late at night and usually what would happen in this dream was that I would see a monster running up towards the stairs or I would be in my bedroom and a monster would run into my bedroom and attack me or it would be my dad because growing up he was emotionally abusive and I remember the fear and dread I used to feel when he would run stomping up towards the stairs and then come running into my bedroom to yell and scream at me.

Now that I live on my own I have cut ties with him because of his toxic and controlling behaviour but sadly the nightmares of him returned and they have not stopped ever since but it's hardly surprising at this point.

There was one nightmare I had that was also incredibly bizarre where I dreamed that I opened a suitcase but after I did that I could see a weird monster with pale snow white hair and no eyes just black holes screaming at me but the weirdest part is that sounded exactly like the sound effect used for mr freeze's freeze gun in Lego Batman which is a game that I used to play years ago on my xbox 360.

Probably one of the most messed up nightmares I have ever had by a long shot if not the most messed up was once during my teens when I dreamed about something so graphic that it might as well have been taken straight out of a Silent hill game or a David Lynch horror film because I saw a darkened room were dozens of dead babies/fetuses with a horrible incurable skin condition called harlequin type ichtyosis were attached onto meat hooks.

Probably the most recent nightmare I have had so far was a dream where I was keeping my eyes shut lying in bed but I could hear the terrifying sounds of two beasts and I could feel one of them on top of me and the other one was biting my neck which I also felt but luckily I woke up afterwards and nightmares of having eyes shut being unable to see a monster attacking me but being able to feel and hear them is something I have experienced previously as a child.

A bizarre nightmare that I dreamed about once as a kid was when I saw a scary looking moon with a face on it that talked in a language/gibberish I could not understand and it said ""Nekko  Nekko"" and afterwards the dream ended.",1673743366.0

I've never meet the guy before, mostly seen his art online and only seen one or two posts of his selfies that he feels comfortable  sharing. I've never interacted with Boss Logic privately either. 

The dream was us enjoying a picnic and just being cuddly etc. It was quite cute but to wake up and question what my mind was trying to say. 

Especially with two nights in a row dreaming of two different men and dreaming I guess in some sense of a relationship. 

In reality I'm single and trying to act like ""I don't need a relationship"" to thrive type of girl. 😅

944,Dreams,I keep having really scary vivid dreams and i don’t know what they mean.,"This started back in September of 2022 and the basic theme of the dreams are i get a phone call where someone tells me to run everyone around me disappears and then a man dress in a black robe with his face obscured stabs me through the chest and tells me i wasn’t quick enough.

The first one i had is where i am at home and i hear my phone ringing in my room on my desk so i go and pick it up the voice tells me to run and my mam and dogs disappear leaving me alone in the house 
Then the door bell rings i answer it the man is there with his face hidden and he say “Not quick enough” stabs me through the chest and i wake up with the pain in my chest as if i had been stabbed. This is the only one of the 4 to change when repeating its all the same apart from where the man is in the first one he’s at the the front door the second time i had it he was at my kitchen door and the third time he was at my bedroom door each time saying “not quick enough” and stabbing me

The second dream is where I’m in collage and i again get a phone call and i answer it to voice telling me to run and everyone in the collage disappears. I begin to head to the reception of the collage to leave when the same man steps out of one of the classrooms on the corridor and again says to me “Not quick enough” and stabs me through the chest causing me to wake up with the same pain as the first one. This one has repeated but has never changed like the first one

The Third one if where it really changed as I started setting alarms at random points in the night to try and wake myself up to avoid being stabbed and waking up with this pain. One night i forgot to do that and this was the dream that followed.

I am at work and again my phone rings the voice tells me to run and everyone disappears but this time my boss walks into the room I’m in and before stabbing me says “you forgot your alarms” and then stabs me in the same place of my chest while then man is sat at one of the tables in the cafe behind him again causing the pain in my chest

These three would cycle out from about November till last night (but in the one where im in my house the man still has not moved further then my bedroom door) where i had a 4th one follow the same motif 

The forth one starts with Me at my old high school and one of the teachers gets really close to my face and whispers “you ready” then my phone rings and again its the voice telling me to run so as I’m leaving the school i see a police officer and i run to them and say please help I’m about to be attacked and then the man walks up on the other side of the officer and the police ask them if they are a whiteness and i then shout no they are the attacker to which the man pulls ou the knife kills the officer (not by stabbing through the chest) and then looks at me says “still not quick enough” and stabs me through the chest causing me to wake with the pain in my chest again.

These have been happing a lot and are so vivid i can remember the conversations i have with people i talk to and the phone number that keeps calling me which is one of my close friends numbers but its never her on the phone and never her contact information that is coming up always the number and always the man telling me to run i go to collage with this friends and in the dream where i am in collage shes right next to me when i get the phone call from her number but not her or her phone

Im lost as to what this could all mean and am getting worried that there is now a fourth one following this motif and concerned as to why its causing me physical pain in the real world when i wake up",1673729844.0

947,Dreams,First Dream.,"This is a dream I've had which is the first dream that developed into actual stories (sort of), and I'm typing what I have written down from my notes in my phone. This had many details that I was very surprised at somehow still remembering now about it, so get ready to read a lot.

This dream took place on March 23rd, 2019.

*I was within these winter woods dressed with all pink clothes, like a Barbie Doll in a holiday movie. I spotted Sans and Papyrus, but in an animated style from the video of Papyrus finding a human. (The one from Piemations).*

*The two skeleton brothers were discussing something, I couldn't hear exactly what, but I knew that it was very serious which is why I followed them back to their house once they stopped talking. It was snowing very hard which made it difficult to see as I questioned myself, ""Why the fuggy is there fog in winter?!"". (Yes. Exact wording).*

*I reached their house, but it wasn't exactly their house. Instead, it was a huge pink doll house where you can be able to see all the rooms and foundations on the side. I remember the 'camera panning upwards' to show my shocked expression as well as showing how tiny I was as it switches over to the full display of the doll house. It looked like it was in the distance, but it was actually in front of me and I was just really small. (Imagine Little Nightmares' Main Character's Size).*

*Suddenly, she was there! The villain bitch from 'Elena of Avalor' (Shuriki). She was making a whirlpool of dark clouds colored like Cloudy from 'Star VS The Forces of Evil' from that episode where he became corrupted. I watched in horror at the spiraling clouds now booming within white lightning strikes that oddly didn't make sound while my pink clothes were now somehow a lavender sweater and black jeans.*

*Close up to my now very concerned face as evil muffled laughter mixed with the harsh winds. Then, there was something that was glowing emerald green below me. I look down at my right hand where I held a glowing Chaos Emerald (From Sonic). I looked back up with a serious expression as I clutched the Chaos Emerald tightly before screaming out, ""You ain't ruining Christmas, you Grinch bitch!"".*

*I started making my way up the many stairs of the pink doll house that somehow went back into the size of what a real, regular house is in real life as the 'camera' tracked my ever move that was used to escape the traps and continue up the stairs. Jumping over huge amounts of missing steps, ducking as several big axes swung back and forward, and doing that cool ground slide to make it through a closing wall.*

*I felt myself running out of breath as I reached the final steps to reach that hatch door leading onto the roof, ready for an End-Game or Epic Anime battle. I opened the hatch door and bright white light filled my vision as I heard the echoed laughter from Chrysalis when she was disguised as Princess Cadance from 'My Little Pony: Friendship is Magic'. I then woke up on a beach chair on a cruise styled like that one episode from Looney Tunes (2015) as I wore a yellow one-piece bathing suit with red polka dots patterned. My hair was also really shiny and curly which I questioned as I got up and headed my way to the shuffleboard game area.*

*When I reached there, Undyne grabbed me by the arm while she wore a white sailor suit as she claims that she's the captain. She pointed me to a broken railing which when I looked over to the classic blue ocean with one small island in the distance that has only one palm tree. (Imagine from Spongebob). All of a sudden a huge-ass goldfish with Napstablook's face on it for some reason jumped out of the ocean before making a huge splash below when it went back into the water.*

*The splash of water went over to this rock nearby that I looked over to and saw it beginning to glow like gold before exploding in a poof of glittering smoke as the rock turned into a small round stage with Mettaton, also in a sailor suit, as he danced around with signal flags like ribbon dance. Undyne then became a real mermaid and then began swinging her spear by its tassel string that was attached on the end.*

Then I woke up.",1673728239.0
948,Dreams,"This is the Cardboard Box Game. I dreamed it, so it has not been playtested at all.","This is exceedingly complicated so stay with me. It’s like FATAL levels of complicated. (Do not look that up. It’s bad.)

This was a game played by monsters during the apocalypse when they didn’t want to engage in sex, violence, or capitalism. For some reason in the match I played, someone insisted on their blow-up girlfriend playing. I don't know why they did this because it was a blow-up girlfriend and could not play cards. It messed up the game balance somewhat, so you probably *don't* want to do that.

**This is a game for eight players using eight dice, eight standard decks of playing cards (with no jokers), and** [a specially prepared cardboard box.](https://i.ibb.co/ZN5jpMx/Screen-Shot-2023-01-14-at-12-13-25-PM.png) Each player has their own die and deck. All the dice start at 1. The winner is the last person who has not been eliminated.

Whenever you reach 5 on your dice, you are immediately out of the game. Your cards can be compared for the rest of the round but that’s it.

**You have a hand of eight cards. You must play a card every turn from your hand face-down to the left (conscious) slot.** Once everyone has played they take a random card from the deck and play it face-down next to their initial card in the right (subconscious) slot.

After this, everyone flips both cards over. The cards are resolved thusly.

**If you have two cards of the same suit**, all other players with a card of that suit in their conscious slot add 1 to their dice (sanity). **However, if another player has the exact same pair of the same suit that you do,** nobody else is penalized, and you and the other player add 1 to their sanity.

This game has trump suits in the order H, D, C, S. After resolving the initial two-suit rule, all the cards in the conscious slot are compared to each other. In this game, suits trump numbers (e.g. a 2 of hearts would beat a 10 of clubs). The players with the two lowest conscious cards on the table add 1 to their sanity. The players with the highest and lowest discard both their cards to a pile next to their deck (unimportance). The rest of the cards go into the top part of the cardboard box, players draw back up to 8 cards, and another turn is played.

The exception is aces, which beat everything except each other and have special effects. **If the ace of diamonds or spades is the highest card on the table,** the player opposite you on the table is out unless your subconscious card is the same color as the ace. **If the ace of hearts or clubs is the highest card on the table,** you’re out unless your subconscious card is the same color as the ace.

The *other* exception is when you have the exact same conscious card as someone else at the table, in which case you’re both out.

After a while, the cardboard box comes into play. **Whenever someone is eliminated at the table,** you pull the strip most of the way out of the cardboard box to drop all the cards into the lower section. **This is very inefficient** and could have easily been solved with separate piles for cards. **The box is there because every fifth turn is played exclusively by drawing two random cards from the bottom section of the cardboard box and placing them into whichever slot you want.** If there aren’t any cards there due to nobody being eliminated early (which is quite possible), everybody adds 1 to their sanity and the box turn is skipped, even if someone was eliminated resultingly. No cards are placed in unimportance at this time; they just go back into the top part of the box.

Because it’s possible that not everyone will die during the initial 22 turns + 5 box turns, **when all the player decks run out, the rest of the game exclusively consists of drawing from the bottom box section.** Once again, when a box turn starts, if there aren’t any cards there, everybody adds 1 to their sanity, which will hopefully eliminate someone and drop the cards.

If all the remaining players are eliminated at the same time due to the bottom box being empty, **it gets really weird.** If there are three or more players, it’s a tied victory, but if there are only two, the two players then shuffle their unimportance and play War with the resulting piles. **The winning player wins the whole game.**

**This is a really strange game, and once again, I didn’t playtest it at all.** If you want to play this, good luck finding enough friends for a round.",1673727413.0

955,Dreams,Any pain I feel when I dream I feel it when I wake up??,"Hello all,

I asked people a lot of people about whether or not they feel any pain inflicted on them in their dreams after they wake up, and everyone says no. 

I have a recurring dream in which a venomous spider bites my hand in the same spot same hand. Each time this happens in the dream I feel immense pain in that spot and, if I’m dream about someone being with me, I’d try to speak and the words won’t come out and then I feel an awful and paralyzing fear that wake me up shaking and with my hand hurting. Same exact spot. Each time I check my hand and there’s nothing on it, no marks or bruises. The pain however, is still there. 

Did this ever happen to you and is there a meaning behind it?

P.S. In those dreams, the reason why the spider bites me is because I try to pick it off someone I love, like my mom, my cat, my bf etc.",1673723500.0
956,Dreams,"Reccurring dreams about trying to lock someone out, and the lock failing","I’ll notice someone is trying to break in, usually someone I know personally like a family member, and I’ll rush to lock the door. It’ll feel like they’re coming to harm me. After I lock it, I’ll try opening the door to make sure it’s locked but it’ll never be locked, the lock never works. 

Sometimes, the type of lock on the door isn’t a lock at all. It’ll be something like a string that’s just strung across from one side of the doorframe to the other and thumb tacked on, something very impractical. And I’m never able to get it done on time, regardless, I fumble around with the string or the tack. 

I usually wake up right when they approach the door and try to come in. 

Just trying to figure out if these dreams mean anything. They happen very often, like once a week or more, and are really unpleasant. The feeling of someone trying to get you and being unable to keep them out or stay safe is scary.",1673723207.0
957,Dreams,"Recurring Dream about ""the volcano fields""","So I've had a series of dreams for the past few months that contain these massive dark gray/black fields filled with volcanoes and lava, usually adjacent to whatever non-volcano terrain I'm usually on. When I first got these dreams, I just thought they were caused by playing Minecraft on and off (I play a little once or twice a year), but the dreams started to turn into borderline nightmares instead of feeling ""minecrafty"". 

Usually I'm just doing whatever, whether it's in my hometown or at some vacation town, and I'm told to stay away from either the East or West (usually East) because that's where all the volcanoes are erupting. I can always see these fields and volcanoes from afar. Sometimes there's even a threat of the lava spilling into the terrain/town I'm currently in.

So there's two things I can take away from this. One would be the fact that I'm rather sensitive to pain (lol hear me out) and I'm especially afraid of getting burned. So lava spilling into my territory would obviously scare me to my core. The other thing is, I wonder if I'm holding back emotions too much and might just ""explode"" or erupt in a bad way. 

Either way, I don't particularly like these dreams and always feel a sense of dread when I wake up. Luckily I don't live near any volcanoes.",1673721634.0
958,Dreams,The Controller,"I uncontrollably lucid dream almost every night… didn’t realize it was a cool thing until recently, but tonight it all felt so… real, like almost so real to the point I knew every single person by name, it was a family and friends diner, things got weird when I see my grandpa (he’s been dead for 2-3 years now) he calls me over, sits me down and tells me and proud he is of me and how I’m doing so good in life. After this I started feeling sick and told everyone grandpa is back, I turn around and he’s gone. Everyone makes fun of me while my grandmother cries. My dad decides to take me home because of this, while driving it all still is incredibly real and I don’t know if I’m dreaming or if I’m just crazy. I notice that there are no keys in the ignition, I get so happy that it’s a dream, when I realized I was dreaming, like I do every night, I start boasting to the people in my dream that I knew they weren’t real. Usually they all act dumb while I continue to play. This time they all disappeared but one, he zapped to my face and started yelling “YOU ARNT DREAMING. YOU ARNT DREAMING. YOU ARNT DREAMING” while the others begged I stopped doing this. Usually I’d wake myself up at this moment but no matter how hard I tried I just couldn’t, soon I enter a knew dream, I’m at Rudy’s bbq my favorite place to eat, only this dream is obviously fake with everyone in it have unrecognizable faces that I must’ve only made up having not seen them before. Although it’s obviously fake it still looks and feels uncomfortably real. I have a “family” in this dream, Only this time my “brother” in this dream quickly tells me “NOT BY ANY MEANS NECESSARY CAN YOU LET THE CONTROLLER KNOW THAT YOU KNOW ITS A DREAM” so me being me let my “father” have his fun thinking I had no clue.

When our waiter comes “father” starts to flirt with the young boy. I decided it would be a good time to make it known I know it’s not a dream by making fun of him for being gay (I’m not homophobic just wanted to get on his nerves) When I started boasting the others begged I stopped, “father” snapped his fingers and shut everyone’s mouth with asphalt tar, he then started laughing as the other cry and try to scrape the tar from their faces, some get it off and start speaking Latin… which I don’t understand but somehow in my dream I understood every word, soon I started getting this obvious pain in my chest as if I was dying. He then walked over slowly growing from human to something I’ve never seen before… it was pure evil, I’ve never dealt with this in my life, probably the most fear my nervous system has ever felt. As he’s walking over I couldn’t do anything no matter how hard I tried to wake up. He then tells me that the next time I do this I will be locked into the “controllers” prison. He comes real close to my face then pokes my chest and I almost instantly wake up… I almost start crying and am afraid to open my eyes thinking I’m in another dream. I am overwhelmed with joy when I realize I am actually awake. I don’t know what to do as I have no control over becoming lucid or not as it’s something I’ve done since a toddler. I’m afraid of going to sleep. My girlfriend thinks I’m over reacting. I don’t know who or where to go for this. Might sound dumb but I really really… really do NOT want to end up in the controllers prison.

961,Dreams,Realistic destroyed Earth.,"The dream started with me waking up in my bed, but aside from that, everything was in ruins. It was a starless night, with no moon. Every building was destroyed, but what amazed me the most was that EVERYTHING was just how it was before I went to bed, only that it was kind of destroyed. For example, the books and rubik's cubes and other things I have in my room were there, none excluded, even the unsolved cubes were just the way they were, even though if I tried to think about every single one of them right now I can't even remember half the details of the things I have on my shelves. 

I tried going outside my house and around the city and it was the same, everything perfectly in place, but post apocalyptic-like, no strange things like a monster or giant traffic cone in the middle of nowhere to be found. 

There wasn't a single living being except me (and the plants). No animals, no dogs, no cats, no humans, nothing.

After exploring a bit, I left the city and travelled around the world by flying or teleporting.

The strangest thing was that I remembered a place VERY clearly (and I never went there or anywhere similar or near it in my entire life), and when I woke up from the dream I google maps searched the place and it was the exact same.

Yes, EXACTLY the same.

Also, I didn't feel anything in the dream. I wasn't surprised, scared, happy, sad, just nothing. I only felt a bit of relief and relax, like I was in piece, at the start of the dream when I realized everything was destroyed.",1673718550.0

The weird part this time is that my dad was there and I haven’t spoken or seen him in maybe 3/4 years. My mom and sisters are always there but this time he was there.

966,Dreams,A philosophical dream about free will.,"In this dream, two characters were helping each other through intense and dangerous situations. They realized at some point, somehow, that their lives were actually being controlled by a godlike entity with reality bending power. They wanted to escape this game, and live a real, independent life, under their own control, but they realized that even the realization was something given to them by the entity, and they hadn't come to it on their own.

This is objectively true. They were characters in a dream controlled by my brain. Everything they did, said, and thought, was experienced by them through my subconscious.

They had a conversation about what it would be like if they ever did escape and were able to act on their own free will. Would they ever trust reality again? Would it feel different? Would they know? Is life even worth living if you can't be sure you're the one in control?

This dialogue was, I think, a way for my brain to process my belief in determinism. I have believed free will is an illusion for years now, and you don't have to agree with that, but it's worth doing some research on it if you want your mind blown. So what if free will doesn't exist? Are we being controlled by some sentient entity? Well, no. We're simply living our lives as parts of the universe, watching things happen like a fully immersive movie.

The conclusion the characters came to after discussing it is that there would in fact be no way to tell if they had escaped the game and gained free will. They wanted to continue living their lives as if they had free will, because that seemed to be the purpose of their entire existence. Their lives still had value and were interesting to them, so they wanted to keep living despite not being able to know if they were in control.",1673713340.0

This one I was walking to my car to go to the gym and I saw a car with a wing sticking out of the passenger side window so I went up to it and I felt the same energy that she wanted me to take the wing so I took it and now I’m awake.

968,Dreams,"Nightmares about amputation, drowning, and giving birth","Tw/Cw: godawful nightmares about amputation and sobbing and blood

So, i had 2 dreams last night

In the first one, i was swimming against the ocean current trying to get to shore and there were people behind me trying to grab onto me. Eventually they all dug their nails into my skin and started ripping. They mainly focused on ripping my right arm off while some of the others were just ripping away random chunks of flesh. I was sobbing the entire time and trying to scream but i couldnt, it was like something was preventing me from screaming. Eventually i got weak trying to swim away and started drowning in ocean water. I was trying as hard as i could to stay at the surface but my mouth was filling up with the water and the people behind me had been ripping off my flesh and my arm was almost entirely ripped off. I got closer to shore, and finally i was able to scream for help. and the second i screamed, they were gone, and i was left alone bloody and exhausted at the cold ocean shore.

The second one is very short compared to the other.
I got up from my bed and sat down in front of my mirror on the floor. I took my pants off and moved my legs. I reached my hand into my crotch until my entire arm could fit. I felt nothing. and then i grabbed something. I slowly took out the moving object i had grabbed and blood was dripping from my neather region. I took the object out and looked at it to find that i had given birth to my own beating heart. and then i woke up.

969,Dreams,Airport/school/heist/cloneing,"My dream this morning between 5 am and 5 40 am 

I'm late to my security class at the airport/mall. Im speeding through a hotwheels like highway with ramps and loops and take an exit to the ground floor. The only parking place is a tiny alley, but luckily my car shrinks to the size of a Vespa. Ive gathered my things and ran into the building. In the class are various childhood friends, past coworkers, and teachers jist talking and hanging oit becaise the professor isn't there yet. I realize my uniform is still in my vespa/car, and say Ill be back. 

On the elevator down, a Italian barresta from work enters and we chat about having to go back to that sketchy alley to my car. He's flirty and wants to escort me. We're walking and I feel his hand go from my back to my butt. Its fine, I think there's maybe going to be some sexy Italian action . But we see a panicked Jamie Lee Curtis at the doors leading out. She's warning us we need to get on a plane right now to Bulgaria and shes clinging to a pilot trying to convince him. She pulls the pilot toward her private plane outside. She is going to wait for us for a little bit. Im getting freaked out and Im like, we need to hurry and catch that plane but I still need to get my stuff from the car. We run out to the alley.

Something is thrown behind us, its beeping and flashing. Looking at it, oh shit it's a bomb, I lock eyes with the Barista. It explodes with smoke and coming from all around us is bullets flying. He looks at me and he says ""Are we seriously in the middle of a heist?"" 

My car/vespa hydrid is blown away like a tin can. We run and duck beside some dumpster and old pallets. The shack I was parked beside was their target. They used battering rams to bust through the chained door and vans backed up. These military grade outfitted gun men carry out loads of equipment and jump into the back of van. They burn rubber and leave while we stand up and go look at the damage. I askes what was that all for? What did they want so badly?

I have a flashback. Inside the dimmly lit shack, late at night, there is a female computer scientist working by the glow of her computer monitor. On the screen is a large glowing black and orange mass. It's like a human ovum or egg, the inside cells splitting rapidly and replicating. I am watching over her shoulder, and she's typing then gasps. She's discovered something, Im asking her what is it?! I'm like a ghost though and when she abruptly backs up in her chair, it intersects through me. Shes busy quickly throwing all her documents into a briefcase. I watch on the screen, and somethings wiggling near the mass. It is growing, absorbing orange energy from the egg. It had formed a sperm, with the same orange and black glow. I say, this...this isn't what I think it is. Is it?! The screen wasnt a simulation but a microscopic projection of these cells in an incubation tank. It was artificial intelligence creating it's own egg and sperm, but it no longer was being controlled. It created the sperm on its own, and the scientist realized the experiment just crossed ethical bounds. But unknown to any other person, except now me, and apparently the hiest crew outfitted with military grade gear.  Artificial intelligence cracked the code on asexual reproduction.

Then I woke up at 5:40am and had to rush to my real security job. I finally could type this dream out 4 hours later.",1673711522.0

Once you enter the driveway, you hear a car behind you. It's her ex-boyfriend who's mad at you and your ex. you quickly run into your girlfriends house and shut the door.
Her ex leaves.

After a few minutes, your gfs dad arrives, and he brought cheese. Once inside, he lays the cheese across the table and lets everyone take some

After we ate everyone was feeling tired so we started to wind down for the night. As you were getting ready for bed, you heard a knock on the door

When we opened the door, there there was a woman in a red dress, warning you of a ghost that's going to come to town tonight.

We all obviously thought she was crazy but as she left and we continued to get ready for bed, the thought lingerd, and you begin to worry

As you lay in bed, you stare out the window, and after a few minutes of watching the streets, you catch a glimpse of what looks like a child.
You immediately sit up to get a closer look, but once you do, she walks out of view... towards your house.

The thought of sleeping is long gone as you hide beneath your sheets. You look over to your gf and  
Tell her you think you saw something. She says it is probably just someone going on a walk... at 10:00 pm.

To no one's surprise, not even seconds later, you hear another knock. You didn't go to answer the door, but you stepped into the upstairs hallway, trying not to make any noise. As you stare at the door from upstairs, you see that your gfs parents don't go to answer. They must already be asleep.

As you stare at the door, it slams open, Surely waking up your gfs parents. You crouch down even further and stare as that child you saw on the street walks through the door. A help menu pops up in front of you (because it's a game, remember), and it tells you that if she looks at you for too long, your head will literally explode.

You quietly crawl back to your room and tell your gf what you saw. She grabs her phone and texts her parents to not leave their room.

You hear the child start to walk up the stairs, you tell your gf to hide, and you do too. You both hide under a desk and cover it with a thick blanket.

The door slowly creeks open, the child walks in and doesn't see us, it walks over to a painting on the wall and stares at it. After a while, it turns to leave, but as the child stands in the doorway, it turns around and sees us (I don't know how), and we end up getting head exploded.

983,Dreams,William Taft murder movie dream?,"
I had a dream that there was this movie about a family of six that lived on a farm and very bad things started to happen to them.  The whole premise was that William Taft wanted either oil on the land the family was on or was guilty of some crime that the family new about. He used the government to take out the family without anyone believing them or knowing. It started off as the youngest boy dying from having objects thrown from a a high place while the family was swimming. During that same attack the father was also knocked out and In a coma and later died. That left the second youngest boy ( have to assume he was like 11), the oldest boy (14 ish) the mother (late 30?) and the youngest girl ( also around 11).  

The dream skips around at this point and we learned clues about why this is happening, such as a guilty verdict on a piece of paper, government people walking around and near the property, and weird clues like “ the bathtub was big” (??).  I don’t know anything about Taft as a president  other then the stuff about the tub. 

Next the mother gets a cut on her face from getting a package of money in-between the horses ( who were attached to a carriage). It’s assumed that the mother dies from this infection. 

Sadly, the dream jumps and I never find out what happens to the brothers, but the only one to survive this is the girl. It is not certain what happens to her.

984,Dreams,"Recurring dream about a cottage, used the interpreter, here's what I got","Thoughts welcome! 

I had a dream about a cottage. I loved it but it was in need of a lot of work. The roof was leaking, a window had been left open so bugs got in, there was a room set up like a laundromat that I knew I'd need to clear out. I was thinking in my dream of what I'd do with the space. It needed new siding. I was worried about how to find someone to do the work but someone appeared on a ladder outside the window and said they'd help. I was worried about if I had enough money to do the work to make it all sturdy. I've had other dreams like this, a cottage I love but is in need of a lot of work that I can't do by myself. Sometimes there's an additional house in even worse shape that I realize in the dream I'd forgotten about, and sometimes I can't even remember exactly where it is although I can see it in my mind, in the dream. 


Interpretation: 

This dream could reflect a feeling of being overwhelmed. You love the cottage in your dream and want to make it into something beautiful, but the amount of work required is daunting. You worry about whether or not you have the resources to make the necessary repairs and changes, but then you have the reassurance of someone appearing to help you. Other dreams like this could be symbolic of feeling like you have taken on more than you can handle and need help in order to make your dreams a reality. The additional house in worse shape could symbolize a feeling of not paying enough attention to other matters that need to be taken care of.

I don't exactly remember who was directing it, but at some point James Cameron came in to shoot some scenes, then Quentin Tarantino shot a few scenes as well. I was helping on the technical stuff and also acting in it, but not with the main cast. All was well, but it was also really weird: Basically, the movie didn't make any freaking sense while being shot, but for all of us involved, it made a lot of sense. There were scenes where we were lying in blue bathtubs while fireworks exploded around us while the actors making the main characters were mumbling some nonsense I don't remember.

But then, there was a moment I decided to take a shit, so I went to a public restroom to relieve myself (and no, that wasn't my subcouncious telling me to wake up before shitting the bed). I went to this restroom and sit on the toilet for some time, scrolling at messages when... SUDDENLY, the door opens and David Lynch comes in.
We look at each other. He silently stares at me, expressionless, for 5 solid seconds, and without saying anything, he violentely closes the door and never returns.
After that, we just continue to shoot the movie. There was a scene where we had to run through a dark tunnel made of cloth while spinning lights surrounded us, and then I woke up with my cat meowing at me.

988,Dreams,Ex lovers dreaming about each other,"Few days ago I had a dream about my ex. I woke up in the morning and texted her. The first thing she said that she had a dream about me. How is it possible that 2 people dream about each other at the same time. We haven't seen or talked to each other in a long time. Is there any explain for it?

The only thing I can think of is Carl Jung's idea of the collective unconscious. But then still why would our unconscious make us dream about each other?

What do you guys think?",1673700878.0
989,Dreams,I had a dream I had an illness,"Alright, before I get into the dream itself, I had a bad night last night. You know, usual bad moods and all that. Though, I was having thoughts of... you know, I'm doing alright now for those worried, but the reason I bring it up is because I think this may have influenced the dream.

In the dream, I was at home, and I had been diagnosed with a terminal illness. I'm not sure what it was, but it made me feel sick and weary. I was dizzy and fumbling around, though it wasn't constant, it was kinda on and off. I remember in the dream I was at home and my two younger siblings were sitting on the stairs together. My brother who is 16, almost 17, and my sister who is 12. Apparently I had to go to the hospital, and I went to my siblings with my mum and I said, ""I'm sorry, but this will be the last time you guys see me.""

My brother and sister cried and they hugged me, which is something they never do normally. I felt like crying too but I didn't. I wasn't scared about what was to come but I was just sad to leave them. My mother hugged me too and eventually she called an ambulance for me to get picked up. I remember getting to the hospital and stumbling into bed before I woke up.

I'm not sure if this is like, I message from my brain or something, after the thoughts I had and all. But, if anyone would like to throw in their two cents of what it could mean, I would appreciate it. I think the meaning of it is clear but I just want to hear what everyone else thinks.",1673700856.0
990,Dreams,1/14/24 Interesting dream. I just woke up from.,"Ok at first I basically had a dream in a dream. 
I kept waking up from sleeping in my dream because my white room door was opened by something and I was like ok that’s weird so I went back to sleep in my dream and was scared. then i woke up from it opening again, then started to freak out and eventually went back to sleep in the dream. Then I woke up from sleeping in my dream to something tickling me and ignored it and was like this is definitely just a dream then grabbed whatever was tickling me cause I thought it’s probably a bug but it ended up being a BUNCH of HANDS and I was like wtf it kinda freaked me out, I ended up getting out of bed and slamming my room door a couple of times to see if I was dreaming and if anyone was awake, eventually a light turned on down the hallway so I walked out my room and looked and it was 2 people sleeping in the room and one of them had there eye open  looking at me and someone was in the bathroom. When I went in the bathroom I told the person  I think there’s a ghost or spirit in my room and they said don’t worry about it we have ghost and spirit sensors and showed me something on a wall and said this will go off if there is so it made me feel comfortable. I went to sleep in the living room in the dream and my dog slept with me to comfort me but things started getting weird again (I don’t really remember what happened here) I remember sleeping under bed sheets like they were over me like a fort and something kept pushing it down and moving it, I think I eventually ended up falling asleep in my dream then having another dream. In this dream it was like a (back room) if you guys ever heard of that but I wasn’t scared anymore, I was exploring. The area I was in now looked like a prison at first idk what it was but I was walking around in this (prison) then I needed to use the bathroom I ended asking some friendly looking people if they knew where one was at and they were like “yeah we usually use this special one in this area” can’t remember the name that they told me. I went to go look for it, couldn’t find it, then I ended up in an area where there was escalator and a family came up it that I felt like i knew and I told them about my weird dream in a dream and what happened and asked where the bathroom was (I don’t remember what they told me) now I’m looking around after talking to them, I see a mall and casino and movie theater and arcade then some elevators.  Walked in the elevator and went up, ended up in an open field party, I saw some people that I felt like I knew but didn’t recognized and told them about my dream, then I met this girl I’ve never seen before and told her about it and she comforted me she was beautiful from what I remember (it felt like she was my ex but I’ve never seen her before) we took some pictures and talked and she told me everything would be fine, and not to be scared then I woke up.

What could this possibly even mean though, So much happened but when I woke up I felt like I learned a lesson",1673700836.0
991,Dreams,Revisiting Familiar Places Over Years....,"I have had dreams over many years where I have a pet, specifically a smaller animal kind of like a hamster, wherein we are both very bonded to each other. I will go a long time, usually a couple years or so, where I will randomly revisit this ""pet"". It doesn't hit me until in the dream, when I see this animal, and we both are so excited to see one another. It is obvious the animal has missed me, but it has also aged every time, and normally is on the brink of starving. To be fair, every time I come back into contact with it, it has been a LONG time since I've seen it in my dreams. Every time, I spend the time to nourish and love it back to health. Any thoughts?",1673698970.0
