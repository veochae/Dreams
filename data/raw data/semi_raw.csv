0,Dreams,I think it was my grandad,"So, I  had this dream when I was a kid , age 9/10 that has stuck with me my whole life (I'm 30f) and I think about it all the time, 
My grandad lived next door but one to us and we were very close, and the evening after he passed away I had a dream that I was looking out of my window and I saw him!! But he is getting into a spaceship and waving goodbye at me! And I'm so hyped up to my mum and dad like ""omg mum, dad it's grandad LOOK!!"" and they just fully was just so Blaise about it , like , okay?? And I'm looking at him and he said he has to go now and to be good,.it still brings a test to my eye now thinking about it, 
I guess I WANT to believe it was my grandad because I wasn't allowed to his house to say goodbye because nobody wanted me to see him like that at the very end, it was different when other loved ones have gone because I got to say goodbye.
Has anybody else had a similar experience? 
Like I said I want to believe but I just can't fully commit to believe it was because of lack of evidence",2023-02-05 21:13:41,1017,True
1,Dreams,A nondescript blurry figure standing over me,"Im laying in bed face up where a blurry unknown figure is standing on my torso towering high over me. This person wasn't heavy, felt like an easy 20lbs. This blurry face from way above me is downcast and says, ""You are a very **** man. Im gonna crush you."" This voice was a deep inhuman type with a hint of a growl. But the figure was human yet without clear distinctiveness to help identify who is on me. The person needed the wall to keep balance while this figure pump its feet on me up and down. I was pinned down and helpless. 

What are your thoughts? I would like some feedback on this dream that is five years old now.",2023-02-05 20:58:10,626,True
2,Dreams,Dream my family hated me because I am disabled,"I had this dream 3 nights ago and it still has me really shaken up. I have a very obviously physical disability irl, I've had it since birth and have a large family with no other disabled people. In the dream my mum, my younger brother and I were on a bus, they were sitting in the back together and I was in the front by myself. The bus drove past someone on the street with the same disability as me and everyone including my family laughed at them. At some point, we got off the bus and I was upset at them for laughing and they were saying things like they have a right to laugh and that they hated me for how I am. I was pretty much being kept in the family as a pet. Also there was a random unrelated thing in the dream that actually ended up happening irl the next day. I guess I'm looking for reassurance that this isn't based in reality because I've always felt alienated from my family.",2023-02-05 20:29:39,896,True
3,Dreams,Furry exhibitionists on a sidewalk,"Oh my **** it was awful.

So awful. 

I was in this furry world, as some type of woman furry that was never specified. There was this cat woman laying on the sidewalk near my house, and she was laying there just begging for some guy to **** her.

I can't take her offer, cuz I wouldn't be able to do it because I'm not a man and I don't have a ****. But as I'm walking away, this faceless guy furry just goes up to her and they start doing it on the sidewalk. Just **** with cars passing by in broad daylight.

I'm standing there watching the whole thing, giggling and laughing watching the two do it. At some point I just start **** by putting my hand in and it feels good. Then it just ends.

I will be killing myself.",2023-02-05 20:29:22,720,True
5,Dreams,I had deja vu 3 times last week,"For context: I don’t dream often but when I do I always wake up thinking that was a little too real. Nothing scary just realistic yet odd situations that could happen in reality. In these dreams I sometimes I have people in them who are only silhouettes. I’ve learnt through my experiences that if I haven’t met this person (yet) they’ll show up in my dreams as silhouettes. Like unlockable characters in a game. Sometimes the scene would be places I’ve never been before until the Deja vu strikes. 

I experienced these dreams in reality last week on three separate occasions. The same silhouettes now have faces. Things that happened in dreams came to. This is the first time I’ve had deja vu in ages but before last week I’d have Deja vu once in a blue moon.

7,Dreams,dream universe?,"first off, this is completely genuine and I am honestly asking for other experiences! 

about 6 months ago I started having dreams that take place in a very familiar area that I and everyone else in my “dream world” understand as and call “orlando” which is where I live IRL. It’s not quite like how it really is although I go to the same few areas every single time I dream. It’s always the same, never scary- literally haven’t had a nightmare in 6 months. The people are the same, usually versions of people I know IRL, including my real life children. Interestingly, it took several months for my youngest child to begin appearing regularly and now he’s always there as well. The things I do are very “dreamlike” but never “liminal” or unsettling, just typical weird quirks that don’t exist IRL. Sometimes, maybe once a week, i’ll be in a certain spot in my house, or running errands and i’ll connect it to the place in my dream world, it will feel the same and maybe look the same at certain angles. I quite literally haven’t fallen asleep and NOT gone to this “dreamworld” in months. Every nap, every “doze off”, every sleep, I go there. 

Has anyone else had this experience? I like it, i’ll honestly be sad if I wake up one day and can’t remember visiting this other place.",2023-02-05 19:10:57,1280,True
8,Dreams,"Dream about outerspace, water, and I think a weird ship?","So I was standing in what looked like a giant dining room with red carpet and I talking to others and there was a big glass window in front of me.  Others were closer to it, and some were further away. Behind me was another giant glass window but further away. To my right was stairs leading up to the main deck.
To my left was bathrooms, kitchen, and stairs, leading to what I presume is an engine room. 
Anyway, I was talking about how exciting it was to be on this adventure. How fun it's going to be.


The other person replied to me, ""Nah, this is scary. Don't you know where we're going?""
Anyway, another person came by and showed me a blueprint of what we were on because I didn't know exactly how it was going to work.  


Basically, we were on a giant yacht that had rockets under it. But also a second part where more rockets were. The third part of the yacht looked like balloons. Basically, it's suggesting that once one part of the yacht hits outerspace, the balloons will lift up like a boat would in water. 


I deemed it would work and gave them a go-ahead to start lift off.


Anyway, we start lift off, and the yacht blimp thing started shaking. We started seeing stuff outside the window move. 


Apparently, we were 128 ft underwater in a bunker as well. After 5 minutes, we started seeing water out the windows. About what was like 30 min in the dream, we escaped the water and started rising above the water. And the person I was talking to said, ""Okay, here we go, the fun part."" 


Yacht started shaking even more, and we were getting ready to take off out of the water. Thevyacht started clearing the water, and passengers were shouting and cheering. 
But looking out the window, we all saw rocks ahead and storm clouds. Disaster was brewing. We all started to worry we might not make it. The yacht wasn't apparently designed to tackle storms, I guess. We all started praying while we kept going up. Apparently, we were all getting worried.  


After another 30 minutes, the storm was upon us, but we were almost above the storm. We were getting alerts that shield will be deployed soon. Please stay in the areas you're meant to be. Pool is off-limits at this time. 


Apparently, this shield was an oxygen and fire shield. The yacht started gaining speed, and we were clearing the atmosphere of earth. Sure enough, the one piece of the yacht lifted up out into outerspace, and the other yacht leveled out like a ship did with buoyancy. We made it outer space. Then, we were heading to a certain spot for vacation. 



Then I woke up.",2023-02-05 19:04:19,2559,True

10,Dreams,I think im in love with a girl that appeared in my last dream.,"Last night i dreamt about this girl. She had long curly hair, was taller than me (and I'm 5'11""), and just so adorable. So gentle, so sarcastic, funny and lovely. She just hugged me all the night, playing with my hair and my face while talking me about her hyperfixation with the Jaws franchise and sharks. 

She was an encyclopedia. Talking me about how she had a crush on Richard Dreyfus, that the shark of the first movie was called bruce, or that the third mpvie was going to be a parody of the series or that she once dressed as Chief Brody for Halloween and nobody got it.

When i waked up... i felt empty. I was so empty that i almost cry. I just missed her hughs and laughs and infinite knowledge about Jaws and sharks. This shark girl was so beautiful, even when I know that my conscience created her **** knows why. 

So yeah. I've been al day missing this girl who does not exist. Really weird, but at the same time... cute in some way. 
Who would've said that a fanatic about Jaws [a franchise that I love the first movie but I'm not interested in the rest] who does not exist would have my heart in just a few hours.",2023-02-05 18:57:05,1129,True
11,Dreams,Physically feeling things in your dreams or nightmares.,"Recently I had a nightmare where I was trying to save a tiny kitten that was attacked by a dog. I won’t go into all the detail because it was pretty graphic and gruesome but at the end of the dream I picked up the kitten and it’s head fell off and it’s heart rolled into my hands and I could feel the warmth and weight of the heart. It was super freaky and I’ve had others where I feel physical sensations but this one was more intense because of the kind of dream. I read somewhere that this could be a sign of some kind of night time hallucinations but I’m not sure if that’s what it is. Has anyone had experiences with this?

12,Dreams,Retrieving souls - a dream (help),"

Could anyone help me please? Not sure if it's the right place to ask but I'm trying to find help to better understand what is happening. I believe in **** but more so the spiritual aspect of it all. I believe in nature being in alliance with us as a source of power which  was designed by a Deity -****-. Therefore I don't believe in **** the same way Christians do. Which is hard when it comes to explaining my faith.

I have been having nightmares or fighting not sure which exactly. I know I won't be fazed somehow I believe to hold something special but that's what everyone believe about themselves so moving on...

I just had this dream about 3 people and I felt compelled to help them then realized they were searching for something they were unable to find, their souls. I helped them find theirs but I had to storage mine in order to do so. I storaged it and it's still with me. In the dream I did my best to help them but I had to merge with them to see where they have lost it. Somehow it felt as though I was successful in helping them but I woke up before I had time to somehow put mine back in it's place but it's still with me. I am not worried about mine , I just don't know exactly what my dream entails.
Can anyone help me? Please 🙏🏾",2023-02-05 18:33:19,1253,True
13,Dreams,Blue bald asian,"I had spent the whole morning studying about religion.

""To make an altar to me, you make a five-pointed star with each line as long as a man's forearm on earth or, more permanently, a high stone altar with a height ""finger-divisible by five, my sacrificial is an earthenware **** broken on its altar with the fist or trampled on, with a piece of human tissue inside it""

After he told me that I managed to speak in the dream, and what I asked was:

""What is your name?""

30,Dreams,Faceless boy,"Firstly, this dream is from years ago, I don't remember exactly how old I was. But I think it was from when I was between the 5th and 6th grades of elementary school, today I'm 16/17 years old and I'm in the second year of high school. 

This one of mine starts with me looking for a colleague of mine, I was trying to find her house, I don't have many recordings of the dream but I remember finding my colleague's “house”, but the house was close to a square, and that square was made of bricks. I had to find a way to get in there, because I had heard her voice. Then, when out of nowhere, I was sitting (I thought I had fallen), on an avenue that is literally close to the block where I live, I was “fallen” on the sidewalk, and at that moment several cars were passing by. There was a time when everything just stopped, as if time had stopped (very ironic kkkksks), and everything was silent, because before, I heard the noise of the cars and felt the heat of the sun, the noise of the trees and the wind blowing in the trees. When for the moment everything stopped, I felt someone in front, a presence. It was a boy, for some reason the moment everything was silent, when he appeared, I only heard the noise of the wind hitting the trees again. This boy, I couldn't see his face because it was blurry, shall we say, a blur to put it better. He reached out to help me up, I didn't even think twice, and took his hand. And then we walked hand in hand, I had gotten lost from my colleague's house, and he helped me. He was silent the whole way. When I arrived at my colleague's house, she was outside. I went to her, but she was still holding hands. Suddenly he released me, but as I had my back to him, I went to turn around to thank him, but when I turned around, he was no longer there, and then my dream ended. 

Does it sound like fiction? Yes aksksk, but I swear not. A while ago I wanted to find this boy, but then I wanted to not care too much about it. (At the time, I think this kid deviated from being the same age as I am now.)

sorry if some words were not understandable, my english is very bad.",2023-02-05 13:26:23,2111,True
31,Dreams,"Watching dreams in a dream, mind control, telepathy","So we went to an inventors house who was very wealthy. He has desensitization chairs so that you could dissociate and join the VR world completely. This VR world is the grand connected dream that everyone connects to when they sleep or forever once they die. You can connect while awake and conscious so that you have more control in the dream. Hypnosis is very popular so that you can build hiveminds or just control a single person for a walk of invulnerability or as a tool. It also makes you more powerful the more you do it.

Anyways, we went down the basement to go watch past dreams to find all the answers to my life and for entertainment. It was a big list of titles on a large windscreen with a few dissociation chairs in front. We sat down and began to watch the dreams in full vision as we dissociated. You are fully controlled by these dreams and are forced to just watch while your in them. This was not like the dream world where you can make decisions. I could still telepathically talk to this person while in the controlled dream as we watched like commentary.

Back to the hypnosis. This also opens the mind for telepathy where you can share thoughts and visions with others and also see and hear them.

And more about the VR world: It has higher dimensions where you can see time like objects that moved are stretched to where they went to and objects that stay still or move just a little have only a little stretch so it makes this big stretched 3d image to look at. You can also connect to dissociation machines in the VR world to play interactive video games where you spiritually control the character in 3rd or 1st person. 

We might be in this VR world grand connected dream and are just at a low dimension or later.

My soulmate telepathed to me in these dreams and it was usually frustrating because they would control me or send me negative energy.

All of my dreams interconnect with my daily life and are there to teach me things, to test me, or to show me the future in an alternate reality. The more I think about dreams the more I remember past dreams pretty clearly during the day.",2023-02-05 13:24:19,2117,True

34,Dreams,The Queen of Filth and Entremets,"I witness as, but am not, a British girl and boy causing trouble in the town. \[hard to explain, but something like my perspective is both outside and within them\] Running through alleys, jumping over fences, crawling through windows. 

I (?) we (?) they (?) **** through a garden. As I step I say

Don’t step on the Aubergines! (Step)

Don’t step on the Artichokes! (Step)

Don’t step on the Courgettes! (Step)

Don’t step on .. whatever these are! (Step)

They’ve made it into a quaint back yard. The family prepares a fragrant dinner, we see them in their garden level windows. I drop a scraggly pine cone outside their view, and the boy and girl push violently through the kitchen window screen, knocking over porcelain knick-knacks, a doll. 

The women of the family shriek. We run out the front door, stomp the aubergines again with our twig-scraped legs. The angry father storms after us/them. The back yard is a knee-deep lake. The boy grabs a bucket as a weapon. The father has brought his, and they start splashing each other with the muddy water as the girl hides, watching from the thick bushes. 

Suddenly, I witness from the father’s point of view. The little boy gets a good splash in, the father(I) is disoriented and stumbles to the lake bottom as boy puts him in a stranglehold, ranting about polite society through gritted teeth while squeezing the last life out of the father. I, Girl, agree with his sentiments, &amp; punctuate his sentences with  “Yeah!”s as I observe. 

I hop into the lake and finish up with boy. The fathers head has detached, but is now a cartoonishly large silicone mask, pale with lightly molded features. I squeeze the fake head, knowing what I’m doing, and say, “We’re gonna teach them, aren’t we?” as the real skull of the father falls out, skin gone, dripping with viscera and blood. 

I re-enter their house, silently. The daughter and mother eat dinner. I have their man's skull under my arm. Nonchalantly as can be, I run a bath and undress. Boy shrinks in size and slinks into the far end of the tub, my dream POV is now his. Seen: The **** troublemaker girl, thick **** hair, yellow brown water, the skull between her thigh and the side of the **** slips down and under water, telepathically telling boy(me) “Shhhhhh… we’ll show them.”

We are now in the living room of the family, now gone, sitting on their holey couch in the dim dusty light, musing about life and polite society. 

Girl: “How phoney it all is… that’s why they’re so obsessed with tea time! Showing off how stuffy and fake they are!”

Boy: “Yeah! Makes me SICK!”

Both laugh, proud of their violence and superior intellect.

38,Dreams,"dreamt I was a passenger on a crashing plane, and I was the only one ok with it...","My dreams have been pretty consistent lately. It's always a repeat of something that happened with my ex (nice things) or something we had spoken about doing in the future.

Last night, I dreamt I was travelling somewhere. At one point I was driving a bus with my dog, but she started having stomach issues so we dropped the bus on the side of the road and walked to an airport. I don't recall the destination but we simply walked onto a plane and sat ourselves down. 

Sometime into the journey the plane made a huge bang and we started to descend pretty quickly. Everybody was screaming and crying and calling loved ones, shouting that we were all going to die... but I just smiled, hugged my dog a little tighter and closed my eyes as a couple of tears rolled down my face. There was fire, a huge bang, and then I woke up. 

For a second when I woke up I felt kinda nice like everything was over but obviously realised pretty quickly that it was a dream and just sobbed uncontrollably. I don't know what it means, and given how my dreams tend to keep repeating themselves lately I don't really want to have that dream again...",2023-02-05 12:15:45,1129,True

I meet up with my sister and one of my aunts and head to the restrooms. I stay outside and start eating my food while they go in. While I'm eating, a big group of juggalos decked out to the nines starts following me with weapons.

41,Dreams,Reoccuring Alligator Dreams,"I’ve been having reoccurring alligators in my dreams, I just woke up from the third one. They all felt nightmarish.

Dream 1: I was with my mom in her car and she was driving in a circle roundabout. There was a lake of alligators to our right. She drove into the lake and almost kept driving into it. The alligators started to get closer. I took the lead, took the brake and backed up the car and saved my mom. Then I just remembered our car &amp; us floating as we back up and an alligator jumps in the air, biting my foot. I kick it and it goes away. 

Dream 2: There’s an indoor lake full of alligators, like a tourist attraction with no fences. It’s being watched by many people. At one point in the dream, me and my boyfriend go out into another dream where we’re on some farms taking photos by someone’s beautiful yard in some farmlands/marshes. The stranger of the yard comes out to check on what we’re doing and they allow us to take the photos. The dream zooms back to the indoor alligator lake. There’s a girl who comes in and grabs a small alligator from the pool, admiring it and laughing. Someone who works with the alligators scolds the girl, asks her what she’s doing and demands she puts it back in the pool. 

Dream 3: I’m in this huge building/campus with a guy checking out the school. I wanted to accompany him to wherever he’s going. The line is moving so fast, and I lose him. I can’t proceed forward because of the body scanners and I lose sight of where he goes. 

One of my old k-12 classmates shows up (she was a popular girl that spread rumors about me a few times, causing others to judge and isolate me- I barely spoke to her throughout school). She smiles at me and asks me if I want to go with her into the building. I assume she doesn’t want to be alone so I accompany her. 

We go through this back door and we walk outside into the backyard. There’s a swarm of small alligators to my left and one large one to my right. We walk away slowly, back to the door. We have a little difficulty at first getting open a gated fence to the building, but get back safely. Other people go through this door and I try to warn them to not go. No employee is blocking off the door as I yell. One man goes outside, gets bitten by an alligator, dies and gets injured. My cousin in the dream also gets injured and died. I am watching other people get hurt and I feel powerless, like I could not save them as I usually do in my dreams.

Could anyone help me figure out what this means?",2023-02-05 11:26:04,2500,True
42,Dreams,I Played Golden Eggs with the Devil,"       I’m sure that the Devil is a common occurrence on this sub, as he appears in the dreams of many. 
   Before I start reciting this dream in the part where I want to tell, there are events that took place before a specific time. Lets go over that quickly. It’ll be very watered down.
      


      I go to Romwe to buy a dress and other clothes. While I’m waiting for my clothing to be done checking out, a ****, wheelchair bound lady wheels into the store with a little girl in a stroller. She starts violently beating this child, so I did the right thing and pushed her out of the wheelchair and start curb-stomping her. Anyway, they somehow cant process my order so they threw the clothes into storage and refuse to give my money back. I go to the storage bank (below store) and attempt to find my things and bring them back up. Well, there were a bunch of things there but I couldn’t find my stuff. As I go back upstairs, I pass out.

This notes my journey before the descent to ****.

When I first arrived, there was nobody. It ran as an old parking garage, but it must’ve been on Piston’s game day, because no one was there. I wandered around for a while, only in my bra and underwear. As a note, I usually do not walk around in public half ****… so I was also wondering what happened to my clothes. I wandered for a time period I cant really convey with a reddit post, but it felt like a few hours. 
   I turn a corner and suddenly seem to cross the border. I see people who seem to be teenagers or young adults, so I could blend in just fine. I don’t recognize anyone. I walk into a sort of common area, it seems. Many people are bunched around with each other. In the middle, there is a man with long stringy hair covering his eyes. He looked pale and thin, and he really, desperately needed a shower. I don’t know what urged me to, but I sat down in front of him on the concrete floor. I’m sure you can guess who he is.

    I was offered a deal : If I win the board game, I win. If I lose, I die. There was nothing for him to lose, but I still accepted. In the first round, miserable defeat is an understatement for what I experienced. I felt as if he saw the cards through my hands, and I’m pretty sure he actually could. Foolishly, I didn’t ask the rules beforehand and figured, “Welp! now or never!”. He was surprisingly accepting, and gladly started reciting the rules. I couldn’t really understand him through his death accent, though, so I asked him to do a different one, like  British or something. He gladly complied, attempting it but struggling. We were laughing so much it was hard to listen to the rules.

The layout of the board is illustrated, but I can’t post it. I will still attempt to explain the rules.

You have cards numbered 1-25. The card portion plays out like reverse solitaire. Thats the only way I can really put it. The squares in the middle were reserved for ones, twos ( created by creating a full 1-25 deck ) and golden eggs (earned by cranking the slots and getting a specific pair of numbers). Plays out like tic tac toe. The slots were cranked when you needed a card, the number displayed is the number on the card you receive. In rare cases you got a specific number and were rewarded a golden egg. When you get the egg, the round ends and you clear the board.

In the second round, I get a golden egg. In the third round, I get a golden egg. In round 2-10 (excluding 7) I won a golden egg. He seemed surprised, to say the least. The only times he tried to cheat me were in the first round, and in one of the round where he attempted to switch our scores around. I did not let him get away with that. 

Moral of the story I won. That in itself is especially weird to me, though. Especially in dreams, I never win. I always die or have something horrible happen to me or have my happiness taken away. I don’t win against the Devil. I don’t win the board game, and I sure as **** don’t beat him like that.

Also, the Devil was really chill. He was kinda hot too.",2023-02-05 11:21:30,4013,True
44,Dreams,kinda scary dream i had nights ago,"I wouldn't say i am the bravest person in the world but i had my fair share of nightmares when i was a kid. I dreamt of various monsters killing me every night (mainly IT  , and the ring's girl) so over time i gained some kind of basic survival instinct while i am in a dream , also now that i'm bigger i feel like i can defend myself better, but the other night i had a kind of weird dream. I was having a videogame like dream , there were missiles and it was kind of difficult to explain but it was overall funny and chaotic , suddenly though the context changed and i found myself in the bathroom facing the mirror . I noticed that my reflection wasn't there so i got closer to look around the corner of the mirror to understand it i guess , then i notice that my reflection was kinda rotated and it was in front of the door , i could see myself ( i dont remember if i was grinning or smiling , i have long curly hair so i couldnt see **** lol) but i stand back immediately. I need to add that i was strangely aware of the situation , i knew what was happening and in fact i stepped back and looked at the door and i thought ""ah ha!"" Checking if the reflection maybe got out, there was nothing and as long i didnt get close to the mirror i thought i would have been safe. Then the dream abruptly changes again and i find myself in my bedroom paralyzed, it was my bedroom just very dark but there was a red eyed shadow at the other side of the room. I dont remember much of the shadow 'cause i was looking at those eyes , they were more kind of bright red dots. First i thought to shape a bubble around me to defend myself (other times i have been eble to materialize things to defend to myself ) , but i felt a mental resistance , like i had to fight against it but in the end i got a bit scared, the dream ended and i woke up. What do you think about it ?",2023-02-05 11:06:41,1859,True
45,Dreams,Is there any meaning to my dream?,"I’ve had this dream a few times now. I’m standing on the ground and decide to jump and when I do, I don’t stop. I jump so high I make it to space and then all of a sudden I just start falling, fast. Right before I hit the ground everything goes black (I know that I splattered) and then I wake up (in my dream) and try to talk to people but they can’t hear me so I figure out I’m a ghost and then I actually wake up. I’ve also been having this type of dream but with different scenarios like I was shot , everything goes black before I die and then I wake up as a ghost.

In the movie Dorthy and I think the M&amp;Ms as well ride Santa’s sleigh to New York once they get there they see the Empire State Building and then it turned into an episode of Jessie.

48,Dreams,"Laid mum to rest last week, was this just a weird dream or were these people reaching out to show me her?","So we sadly said goodbye to mum last week in a lovely send off, she was relatively young, 50s, and passed after a short illness.
I haven’t given too much thought to the afterlife. I meant to ask, but never found the time to ask mum to let us know if she could, that she was okay.
Last night I had a dream I was woken up by our dog whining on my bed, and in the dream I walked over to mums room and sat on the bed she passed in. I saw mum appear in the doorway to her room, she was still but was being supported by I think people? I don’t remember her saying anything but her eyes seemed to recognise me and were looking right at me. I remember feeling real sadness, and a little frightened really. She seemed to yawn and bend over as if she was about to fall over when the people supporting her guided her back upright, as she was turned away I said I hope you are okay and in a happy place mum and they faded away.
It was almost like the people were showing me mum, but mum wasn’t able to respond?

49,Dreams,zombies in the phoenix suns practice facility,"i had a dream that my step brother and i were scheduled for therapy with back to back appointments. my appointment was overlapped with some weird basketball activity that took place at the phoenix suns basketball court (idk why the suns i’m not a fan of them). it was more of a practice facility than an actual stadium. my parents made me cancel my appointment so we could go to the court, which really upset me. i was kind of a **** to my parents as we travelled to the court. when we got there, the power went out. this was weird but we were all ok. the power eventually turned back on. then, everyone besides me disappeared. i was opposite to the exit in the top row of the bleachers so i started walking towards the exit, not running. the power soon turned back off. my sister came in the gym running and waved at me to tell me she was alive. as i was walking down the stairs, an old paraprofessional from school was walking up the stairs. i waved at her, and she responded in a male voice. i got closer and her skin was tinted bluish green, and then i realized, she was a zombie. i booked it towards the door, being chased by her. the door was locked but i kept trying. i look up at the window on the door, and zombies are on the other side. then i wake up",2023-02-05 10:09:25,1261,True
50,Dreams,Thought it was the end,"So i had a dream i thought was gonna be the usual but it wasnt. I often times have dreams about high school field trips or jjst being back at school and on this particular dream we were pulled over in a parking lot getting food for everyone on the buses. I somehow ended up with my shoes off while standing in the parkimg lot and some guy walks kinda close and says he likes the shoes they look like his size, he proceeds to try and put them on but i shove him away and he acts like it wasnt a big deal, he walks to his car and pulls something out the driver side back seat. At first i saw orange in his hands but then he held it up and shot multiple times, it was a radio like a boafeng but it worked like a handgun, i ran into the nearest building saying ""i escpaed the shooter"" in a comedic way but then i see a lil blood on my finger and i see the entrance wound, i instantly get lightheaded and start to collapse, i pulled my shirt open and it was as if the gunshot happened years ago and was already partially healed. This whole time i felt as if i actually got shot, in real life every inhale was extremely painful and ive never had a dream that convinced me i was actually injured or dying.

TL:DR got shot over my shoes and could feel the pain in real life moments before i fully woke up",2023-02-05 09:56:58,1296,True
51,Dreams,I killed my girlfriend in my dream but it was self defense,"I want to know what my dream means so I appreciate any response

I was in an older building, looked limilar to the building from legacies (the school) but it seemed to have a clothing shop or thrift store in it and on the other end of the store was a long dining table with everything but food on it (plates knives forks candles) EVERYTHING. it was me and maybe 6-10 other strangers in this area and nobody had any issues with anyone because it was all strangers. I remember the lights were out besides a dim glow from a fireplace at the long end of the dining table. everyone seemed confused at first like they were waiting for something so they were all kinda nervously meandering around. I remember just kinda hiding from everyone hiding behind the clothing racks, hopping from behind one rack to another trying my best to not be seen. all of a sudden while I was crawling in between racks I saw an old lady and I smiled at her and I wasn't sure if she saw me but there's no way she wouldn't have, but she still acted like she didn't see me, so I went behind the next rack and she walked the opposite way and I suddenly popped up and yelled to everyone, I KNOW WHAT GAME THIS IS, ITS A **** MYSTERY, the old lady lunged at 2 people standing together with a knife, just before she got to them I jumped on her and got cut a couple times on my arms but I eventually got the knife from her and stabbed her in the ribcage area. when i looked up it was my girlfriend. she kept trying to fight me and she had another knife somehow and I got cut a lot, more than the first time (still just my arms). I still ended up getting the knife from her and I aimed for the neck this time to try and **** her faster. I stabbed her neck and pulled it forward to be thorough, and I told her on the verge of crying ""you know I love you"" she responded with ""I know, I love you too"". 

we've been getting into fights a lot recently and it's not always something bad but it always gets really nasty, I've also been in a really bad mental state and it's been about more than just that. I'd never **** someone or anything like that either.

56,Dreams,dream that came true,"I have seen comments here that dream cannot predict things but I completely disagree. When I was 23 i lived on my own. I got extremely lonely and depressed. I cried and prayed about it sometimes. One of those nights a dream: i was riding in the backseat of a car on the drivers side, my sister was driving, my mom in the front passenger side. The car was kind of a cream color inside. We were on our way somewhere and had a positive feeling. Someone was next to me in the passenger side talking. He was turned way from me and i could not see his face. He had dark thick kind of wavy hair, he was talking but i couldn't undersand what he was saying because of his thick accent which i had never heard before. 

When i woke up from the dream the realization came to my mind: wow, that is my husband! And i was trying to figure out his accent, was it greek? Of course i felt happy for a while after that dream. Eventually i forgot about the dream. 

Fast forward to when I was  27. I started dating someone. We decided to get married. I had completely forgotten about the dream until the day my mom, my sister, my fiance and me were all riding together to go to my uncle's house. I wanted to introduce him to my uncle. My sister was driving, my mom was in the front passenger seat, i was sitting in the rear drivers side and my fiance was sitting next to me behind my mom in the rear passenger side. There was a moment where i realized I was in the exact scene from the dream and it all came back to me. The cream colored car, my sister driving, mom as the passsenger. My fiance was turned away from me looking out of the window and i could not see his face, all i could see was the back of his head and he did have thick dark somewhat wavy hair.  He was talking in that moment and he did have the same accent from the dream. Turns out that was an Egyptian accent!

I have always been fascinated by this experience bc it is hard to believe that could happen. To dream of someone before you ever met them. However i believe that his face was hidden for possibly different reasons. I read the brain cannot create a new face it has never seen before; maybe this is true. From a more dreamy perspective maybe the face was not revealed to prevent me from looking for that person or knowing their identity. 

My dreams have always been a bit different. I dream in color most of the time at least dreams I remember or become aware of. I may have some dreams that i dont remember at all. I have dreams that pick up where another one left off in the same settings telling different chapters of a story if you will. Different settings that i keep coming back to and have a familiar feeling to them. When i am in those dreams i have the feeling of recognizing that place.

 I would love to hear any feedback about anything i discussed above.",2023-02-05 09:08:09,2827,True
57,Dreams,"I moved out of my first childhood home in 2010, and I keep having strange and uncanny dreams of being back in that house.","I was 9 when I moved out of my first childhood home in 2010. I'm 22 now, and I still keep having strange dreams of being back in that house. I have crippling anxiety and attachment problems, so I was very devastated when I had to move out of the only place I could call home. It was like an anchor to my identity. While I miss living in that house and reminisce my happy, carefree days of living there, I eventually came to terms with change after becoming an adult.

For 13 years, I've had dreams of being back in that house.  Each scenario of the dream varies. Sometimes, I break in to tour around the house as quickly as possible before getting caught by the current residents of that house. Sometimes, I'm like a ghost walking around the house and no one notices me. Sometimes, I randomly appear in my old bedroom and start searching through the closet for childhood items such as brightly colored purses, Keroppi or Hello Kitty plushes, Barbie dolls, and etc. Some dreams even take place on the cul-de-sac in front of the house.

My 2 most recent dreams regarding the house were more strange than ever. One was scary, and one was wholesome. In the scary one, I ran through the open garage and walked around the house. When I ran back out, I saw a man sitting in a car on the driveway. The man looked angry and asked me, ""How often do you come here?"" I nervously answered, ""Not often,"" and the dream ended there. In the wholesome one, the homeowners saw me standing in the cul-de-sac and said hi to me. I told them that I lived in their house when I was a little girl, so they invited me inside to look around. The first room I went to was my old bedroom.

What I find odd about these dreams is that I have no desire on breaking into anyone's home. That's an invasion of privacy. Dreams have meaning, and these dreams must have some kind of distinct meaning if they've been reoccuring for 13 years.",2023-02-05 08:59:10,1902,True

In my dream, I was on an airport escalator, and he was waiting for me at the bottom. I then ran into his arms to greet him. I never dream, let alone dream of someone. What can this mean?

So we both jumped ready to risk injuring ourselves falling than fighting those things.

Then she smiled. Looked at me warmly and said ""come find me when you're wake up"" and then the dream ended when we fell and I woke up.

She never told me her name(maybe rose?). I couldn't remember any physical traits. All I remember was that she would always carry a book or notebook that had a rose on it with vines around the book for decoration.

66,Dreams,A lock between me and certain death,"I heard steps coming from the stairs, must have been many people, however I knew it wasn't people. In the middle of the apocalypse, it was the last sound I wanted to hear. The door to my apartment was locked but I forgot to barricade it. I stayed silent hoping they would not hear me. As I was watching the door in fear, the lock started turning, as if they had the key. I jumped to the door and started pushing on the lever that locks the door from the inside. I heard growling and screaming from the other side, they knew there was someone inside. I had to keep pushing because I could never hold the door shut against 4-5 zombies. As I was losing strength the lock suddenly opened but I immediately closed it again and pushed even harder despite my fingers hurting. They gave up for a second and I took the chance to jump out the window onto a nearby roof. I saw a woman on a balcony asking for help to a man from the opposite balcony, then a huge tongue came out of her mouth and grabbed the man. Once she got back inside I jumped into the man's apartment. I closed the window, ran to the door and thankfully it had tons of locks. I went back to the living room, lied down on the floor next to the sofa so I could avoid the windows and keep an eye on the door and spent the night like that shaking in fear.",2023-02-05 07:20:08,1310,True

69,Dreams,Dreamt of a bus turned rollercoaster ride.,"In my dream my bus trip home started off really nice, with beautiful scenery of the sea and greenery, then as it approached the highway I saw my old workplace and the road became steeper and narrow gradually, to the point it became like a 70 degree drop. Encountered many of them and was grabbing my seat as tightly as possible. Soon it passed through a few newly made roads with construction still ongoing and somehow the bus went through the railway path, even saw a new train station named Iron Stop or Iron Path (can't remember exactly). That's when the journey becomes enjoyable. We passed through underground then suddenly encountered a few waterfalls and passed through them, making us all wet. Everyone started laughing and making small stops and i realized some of my friends were on it. Made some new friends and finally reached my stop.

70,Dreams,A dream where a red airplane crashed into a church,"I was driving with my bicycle on an island with a very cold climate and pure white snow everywhere and a constantly dazzling sun. There were many people and cars and bicycles and streets in a very mountainous area. Everything was very hilly.
At the time it was around 4 p.m. with the sun still out and I was driving somewhere with my bicycle. Outside the island you could only see an icy surface of water disconnecting the island from anything around it for as long as the eye could see.

After crossing a very busy street I stopped and took a closer look at this mountain that I had driven past so many times. I had always wanted to climb a mountain. From my perspective it didn’t look nearly as hard to climb to the summit of the mountain. I drove up a very steep surface (it was basically like a wall) all the way up with my bicycle and landed at the foot of the mountain I wanted to climb. I should mention I was quite dehydrated at the time but I was so motivated to climb to the top of the mountain. I was at the mountain’s foot when I saw other people on other mountains further away from me celebrating their victory of climbing to a mountain’s summit. They wore very thick jackets and gloves and protective eye wear and so on. I did not have nearly as good protective gear.

Then I noticed an older lady in her mid 40s (she also came there with a bicycle) that also appeared interested to climb the mountain. She was a really nice lady. We decided to climb the mountain in a collaborated effort. As we kept climbing we discussed how we both had been tricked by the mountain’s low appearance that made it look like it would be easy to climb. It was the opposite and I became very exhausted and was not confident at all that I would be able to go much further. I was only driven by my intense curiosity and will to keep going. At one point I was pushing on the snow a bit and fell a little into the snow, noticing how frighteningly powdery it was. The lady helped me out.

It was then that we looked around us to our left and noticed another island disconnected from ours. It was a very hilly island and had little houses all over it and a church and streets and everything that makes up a little island town.
Seconds later we saw a red airplane that looked like it had been drawn with crayons fly suspiciously low above the island. Next it looked like the airplane had only slightly touched the island’s church but it had actually crashed into it. Both the airplane and church fell down, taking down with them a third of the whole island into the ocean.
The lady and I were in complete disbelief as to what we had just witnessed. We couldn’t believe we were witnesses of an event like this. Nothing like this had ever happened; this island next to ours had been living in total peace for decades.

We decided it was time to discontinue our journey for now and go home.

Later that day on GitHub (apparently most if not all of the people on the island were programmers) I saw users posting about the sadness of the event. There was a social media tab where people could just make text posts. It said “472” new posts. I clicked and read some posts. I was still in shock that I had been a witness. I wanted to make my own post about how I had witnessed all this and how sad it made me.",2023-02-05 06:49:05,3290,True

They didnt seem to sense us and the girl with my friend and i told us to stop and listen and we heard a growling sound from the person kneeling next to us. They were werewolves is what i am thinking.

We suddebly start running and two girls are standing giard in the opposite building and they see us but dont do anything. We turn so they cant see us anymore and then the wall had several sections so you could go into one and hide.

On the other side we saw the werewolf princes going and run but then choose to hide but the elder prince sees me and comes to my hiding spot and i am literally shivering in fear. 

He asks whos there and puts his hand forward to grab but then turns to leave and sees a dead body from **** knows where. He then comes back and asks me to come out then brings his hand forward and calls someone to capture me.

NOTE: he didnt see me in my hiding spot just stood there asking me to come out, he didnt come all the way forward to be able to see me and i only saw him wearing something pink and his hand. The younger prince wore a dark but not too dark blue.

I saw someone get hit by it, they got flown against the wall barely missing me and their body broke into pieces, which is when I was running and another truck almost hit me and I saw a bunch of trucks just ramming into eachother etc, then I woke up.

I did have another dream that I was some sort of person with important documents and I was being chased, I felt like if I didn't get away I'd die.

**My Dream: Feb 3rd, 10am**

My  dream started out with me waking up. There were people over for my  brothers party. I got out of bed and started to chat with people in a  way that I felt almost like a host. My friend who I shared the dream  with was also in it, but I only saw him once. We were speed running  Mario 64 as it was the video that I was watching before I had fallen  asleep.

As the party went on,  there was an older couple in the bathroom and the husband was having a  seizure. They left the party for the hospital, and the party kept going.  Eventually, people started doing drugs which was not my kind of thing,  so i decided to go back to bed. There was a girl sitting on the floor  against my bed and side table with her back facing towards me, almost as  if she was waiting for me. She had shoulder length dark hair and was  very still.

I looked at her and  said ""you know, you can tell me if this never really happened"" since I  for some reason recognized the event like a memory, but I knew that  there was never a party. She turned towards me and her face was very  pretty, and she felt familiar and comforting in a way, even though I had  never met her. She then said to me ""None of it was ever really real"".  My bedside table had now turned into a deformed black mass with holes in  it, almost like what you would see if you searched up Trypophobia. ""My  vision then slowly turned to complete white, with numbers that shuffled  into words (that I can't remember) with loud ringing, almost like a  flash bang from a shooter game (but not as intense).

Words  kept appearing and being shuffled while my vision was still completely  white. Eventually I got uncomfortable and started to force myself awake,  as I realized that I was dreaming. However, when I awoke, I struggled  to move almost like my whole body was numb.

**Friends dream (written by him): Feb 3rd, 5:20 am**

So  the dream starts off with me in a local mall. I was facing this store  front of a painting shop where this lady creates and sells her  paintings.  I walked right in, with the intention to buy one to decorate  my apartment that I had just bought (in real life).

The  first thing I notice is that it is a long room with paintings on all  walls, with a long table in the middle. All the paintings had a specific  theme to them, all being primary colour dark blue and secondary colour  orange. I see the lady sitting at the very back of the store working on  something, so i walk on over noticing she is an average height woman in  her young 20s, brown/light brown hair, Caucasian with a pretty face and  nice body.

I start complimenting  her work and maybe feeling like i might start flirting with her if the  conversation goes towards that direction. She starts to act all humble  about it and says “oh they’re not bad”. And i reinforce my compliment by  restating that they were actually cool. So she leans in and tells me  “if you wanna see something cool, come with me”.

She  gets up and takes me to the front of the store near the door. There's a  table with a microscope lens thing (?) on the table with some computer  gadget next to it. She tells me to look into it and i see the number 52.  I look at it for a moment and process this number but then start to  question the meaning. Before i get a chance to ask, she grabs my left  hand and tells me to press this black rectangular button with a little  extruding dot in the middle. So, I pressed it and the number turns to 53  and within a split second of the number changing, my vision starts to  go pure white and it gets brighter within seconds and I lose my breath.

At  the same time, there is a deep bass sound with a high ringing  frequency. It almost sounded like someone scratching nails on a  chalkboard. I wake up with my body facing upwards (which never happens, I  sleep on my stomach) and I don't move. I'm not sure if i could have  moved or not but i was panting like a dog for air and i could only move  my eyeballs, trying to process what the **** just happened. A minute  later I move and I look around, then I go back to sleep on edge.

\-------------------------------------------------------

After  discussed our dreams, we came to the conclusion that when he looked  through the microscope, seeing 52 meant that 52 was for him since he had  the dream first, and that when the number changed to 53, it was almost  like he had to pass on that number, like it was for me.

**We would love to hear if anyone has ideas on what the similarities might mean**

**- Similar looking girl**

**- Same white light with ringing**

**- Numbers**

**- Similar wake up**

I got spooked and ushered my family into the bathroom, where I realized we were not protected by this flimsy door, stuck, and made the wrong choice. My feelings were of impending doom. Feeling ashamed at having made such a **** choice, and trying to accept my fate.

After waking I realized the tiger made no threat, and I had no reason to give up so soon. But I have never had a tiger in a dream before, and can't think of anything that would prime one to appear. I haven't been watching any tiger or wild-life shows or anything.

79,Dreams,false awakening loop and weird sensations,"okay so tonight I probably had the weirdest experience of my life.
i had false awakenings many times in my life but they were never this… scary

the first dream starts quite normal, it was a very “average” dream set in my bedroom and for some reasons i started eating cookies on my bed, leaving some crumbs. (ofc in the dream)
then I “wake up” and of course I’m still in the dream but my room looked identical to my actual one, there was even my cat sleeping near me

so i start thinking about the dream i had before when i notice that there were some crumbs (the ones i left in the dream) in my room so i freak out, realise i was still in the dream and “wake up” again.

in this other “layer” the crumbs weren’t there so i was quite confident i was actually awake. it was 6 in the morning (in the dream but probably also in real life) and for some reason i had my phone near me, in my bed (which is weird because i always charge it and put in on my desk in the night) 

i saw that my mom had texted me saying a random thing about a celebrity she likes ( i know you aren’t supposed to be able to read in dreams but i actually was, the only weird thing was that the hours in the messages were off)

at this point i think i “wake up” again and the texts were still there, so i started getting exasperated because i just wanted to wake up
suddenly i felt my neck “pulled back” like i didn’t have control of my body and I “wake up” again
this time there was a weird ball of white light standing in the hallway (i sleep with my door open so i could see it) and when i looked into it, my body started vibrating, it was very… weird

then im pretty sure i actually woke up, thought about the dream for a few minutes and then fell asleep again as i was too tired to stay awake

now the scenario is different, and im actually getting ready for school when my mom mentions that i “would be late for elementary school” 
so here i realise i was still in a dream as I, of course, don’t attend elementary school anymore 😭

then the weirdest thing happened: i kept “waking up” in my room for like 10 times like a fast loop, i don’t know how to explain it but it’s like i was going through different layers at full speed
then i felt my neck being pulled again, i had my eyes closed and i could only see warm light and i felt my body vibrating, like my conscience was coming back into my body (i have never had astral projections in my life)

I know it may seem dumb but i am actually freaked out, not by the loop but by those weird awakening sensation. it almost felt like i was having a seizure or something",2023-02-05 02:58:58,2591,True

I had fallen over and was giggling about it, as i got up and brushed myself off i saw a spirit, blue and pale - like a will o the wisp. Just an orb almost with a smoke surrounding it. 

I welcomed it forwards, extending my arms like an embrace and the spirit came to me and entered my chest. For a second i was floating. Only and inch or two off the ground and a wave of sadness washed over me. This was a small spirit, so sad. And as i felt their emotions i began to cry.

82,Dreams,Had a dream where I was smashing cars with an axe in a parking lot,"So recently I've been under a lot of stress and am just now getting some relief from it. I'm not a violent person so I figure this dream was my mind's way of letting off steam. Basically in the dream I was in a small **** mall with my wife. I think we were going to a restaurant to eat. I stepped out of the restaurant saying I had something I needed to do. I went out to the parking lot and one of those big red axes you see on fire trucks was in my hand. I went up to a few cars and just started screaming about hating them while I smashed them to pieces. Then a few more cars parked and I smashed them too, all the while I was insulting the cars. I just stood there for a bit. My wife came out of the restaurant and asked me if I was coming in, but I told her I was waiting to see if I wanted to smash another one. Then I started thinking stuff like ""hmmm...I wonder if the owners saw me do this. I wonder if there are security cameras here. I should leave before anyone confronts me.""

84,Dreams,Popping a zit except it's horrifying,"I just figured some might like to know that such a horrific thing could even be conjured by a regular **** dream but otherwise, there's not much to tell:

I was looking at the mirror, popping a zit. I was pressing at it from both sides as you do and it kept coming out until, as I continued pressing, it began to change color and a lot more came out than one would expect. As I cleared away the \[substance\], I could see that what remained was my own prolapsed flesh from which appeared strands of what were clearly intestinal worms. They weren't wriggling or anything but you know them when you see them. And yet, despite how horrific this was, my main concern was others seeing this and giving me **** about it. So I stuffed it back in my face and continued with my day. lol

The actual craziest thing about this dream is that it was so vivid that it actually registered as a **** memory. I have to rely on the knowledge that it was a dream (and that what happened couldn't have happened) to know that it wasn't real. Nutty. Lately my dreams have been becoming a lot more vivid. Even had one where I was playing Hunt Showdown except /I/ was the one shooting the guns. I had a scoped Sparks LRR and was shooting from the fifth floor of a five story building at a trio who were on the roof of a three story building. I could feel the trigger pull, the recoil, and even did the reloading. I even had a wacky skin for my pistol where the cylinder and barrel were made using a repurposed food can of some sort but was super polished. When I woke up, the name ""silver dollar"" came to mind since, on the hammer side, there was an engraving that looked like a coin. In fact, I could even draw what the gun looked like. In fact, when I was reloading the revolver, the bullets themselves had numbers on the primer from 1 to 6.

Also, when I went to go loot the hunters while my team was off doing something else, I started getting shot at by some other team that had been watching their bodies. When I took cover, I saw six scout bugs flying at me, one after another. I just sat there fixing heavy bleed for a while, annoyed that my team was so preoccupied with whatever they were doing that they couldn't hear the commotion outside.

Dream veered off heavily after that and I don't remember much except that I almost got run over by an old-timey WW2 jeep. Now, all of this begs the question: ""That second part was a lot more interesting than the first. Why didn't you just make the post about that?"" To which I say: ""Well, where would I have fit the zit story in?"" lol. I figure it's better to follow up utter nonsense with something cool rather than the other way around.

Anyway, here's hoping for more vivid dreams. Getting more opportunities to parse the validity of my experiences is good. Helps me fair better at regaining clarity in conditions where I might lose it.",2023-02-05 01:57:28,2867,True

In my dream, I felt compelled to go upstairs and check the attic space out. When I did the entire sound system was set up, plugged in, and on with the volume all the way up. If any sound was input to the microphone the entire house (if not neighborhood) would hear it. 

I thought to myself, ""I'm glad I checked up here. If anything fell we'd hear it for sure."" And I turned the sound system off. 

I don't own a sound system. I do own a cheap microphone I'm trying to sell, but I don't know if that's the inspiration for the dream.

I introduced myself to all these millionaire directors and bullshitted my way through every conversation. I made up names, places, events and rolled with it while all these scummy corporate **** spilled their dirtiest secrets to me.

\#1: Van Pelt (the hunter from Jumanji) and I were walking together on a forest trail but he wasn't the intimidating hunter he was in the movie. Instead, he acted like a super hammy and over-the-top Monty Python character and was ranting to me about how only certain species of palm trees were capable of wiping their butts after pooping because their leaves were long enough to reach. Fan palms couldn't reach their butts to wipe and Van Pelt was getting SUPER worked up about how unfair it was. To prove his point, Van Pelt dropped his pants and wiped his own butt on a palm leaf before handing it to me and shouting ""YOU SEE? FAN PALMS CAN'T DO THIS!"" I just gave him a confused look and set the soiled leaf on some kinda rack on a cavern wall like it was a decorative ornament. This dream actually made me cry from laughing so hard. 

\#2: Wolverine and Magneto are fighting each other in the streets of Paris in the style of Mortal Kombat. Round one, Wolverine beats Magneto and performs a decapitation fatality on Magneto. Magneto's headless body falls to the ground, neck stump pulsating in a rather disgusting manner. Round 2 is where the funny part happens. Wolverine wins a second time and instead of performing a fatality, Wolverine begins chanelling the energy of Freakazoid and begins to publicly humilate Magneto, claiming Magneto to be Mexican even though Magneto is Portuguese in my dream. The following scene happens.

Wolverine: \*runs up to nearby cafe and knocks on the glass, alerting the customers\* HEY EVERYBODY! Magneto here is MEXICAN and his last name is HERNANDEZ!

Customers: \*Stop eating while staring blankly at Wolverine\*

Wolverine: \*Is now suddenly animated like a Ren And Stimpy character and starts doing a really effeminate-looking butt-shaking dance while snapping his fingers\* HERNANDEZ! HERNANDEZ! NANNY NANNY BOO BOO! HERNANDEZ! HERNANDEZ! NANNY NANNY BOO BOO!

Magneto: NO! SHUT UP! NO! DON'T LISTEN TO HIM! I AM PORTUGUESE, NOT MEXICAN! NOOOOOO!

\#3: Was browsing deviantArt when I came across a guy who was completely obsessed with the concept of evil elves and gnomes holding world domination meetings at IHOP. He somehow managed to create and upload his own song which was a complete ripoff of ""Whistle While You Work"" from Snow White &amp; The Seven Dwarves only the whistling part was somehow played on a tea kettle. The only lyrics I remember from the dream was ""And then they passed the butter"" before the tea kettle version of ""Whistle While You Work"" kicked in.

I’m not sure when it starts, but I begin to remember floating in an empty space, I am not a human and I don’t have any body. I could go anywhere in the empty space, and could be anything while being nothing. Then the dream begin to end, and i begin to remember that I am a human, then who I am. The dream kind of makes me question reality for a little while, but I eventually continue my day normally.

90,Dreams,I had a gnarled dream.

I thought my parents wouldn’t notice, and they didn’t but the maid did, she was staring at me, through the window in the upstair area, so I quickly rushed back inside and the maid was ground level, in the kitchen, doing laundry like nothing happened. Then the dream switched, I was in one of my teachers room but it was night and it was just for fun, the room was dimly light and the tables were more like the wooden ones with metal around it, I remember seeing some friends and some random “extras”. I got into an argument withone of my friends, another friend was sitting behind me and the first friend was across the table, so after that I set up a table on top of one of the others facing towards me, vertically, then my phone rings so I look at it and it stoped before I could look at who it was, and I asked my teacher if I could go outside the room into the hallway and I call the person,she said yes. the person was the maid from the other dream, she said something along the lines of this “I have killed your parents and now I am more powerful then ever before” it sent chills down my spine, then I woke up, terrified.",2023-02-04 23:40:14,1383,True

92,Dreams,I had 50+ lucid dreams in a day (fucked Jamie Lee Curtis),"It all began when I woke up at 8am. I was having a cluster headache and I waited until that went away and usually when I get a headache I get very very tired. I then decided to go back to bed at around 10am and that's when the lucid dreams began. Bear in mind I dream every night and have vivid lucid dreams often and learned how to control them very well and teach myself how to stay in them longer over the years. Back to the story, it's 10 am and I decided to go to bed after having a cluster headache. I wake up in my dream which is just me in my bed in the same position in went to sleep in but it feels different or ""off"" feeling. So I immediately jumped out of bed and opened my bedroom door and the whole house has changed and there are people in it that I don't know. I then decided ""hey, I'm just gonna start spawning in some **** to **** because why not?"" And I spawned in a young Jamie Lee Curtis. She appeared in the bathroom like I tried to do and we **** for like 2 minutes and I woke up. And for the next six or seven hours I was having 510 minute+ long lucid dreams that all involved me controlling them and trying to do things ect. Why can I have 50+ lucid dreams in a day when people only get them once a year or not at all? 


Tldr: Had a cluster headache, went to bed, had 50+ lucid dreams within 6 or 7 hours",2023-02-04 22:48:34,1330,True
94,Dreams,Unusual Food dream,"I had a dream that i was at a birthday party (it was unclear whose birthday it was), and there were caterers serving Mexican food that chose what you would eat. They supposedly had a sort of psychic ability to guess what each person would like/what nutrients they needed. As I was in line to get food, I watched each person get common mexican dishes like tacos and enchiladas. When it was my turn, the catering lady looked me up and down and gave me an open-faced bean and cheese burrito (bean and cheese is my favorite mexican food) and I felt happy about it, but then I watched in confusion as she poured a large ladleful of brown gravy on the beans…so much gravy that the beans were practically swimming. Then I felt disappointed, because I was given something I liked but then had it ruined by an unnecessary and unusual ingredient - but I felt as if I just had to trust that the lady knew what she was doing and eat it anyway. But I couldn't bring myself to even try it and I threw it away. 


I don't know if this has any relation, but about two weeks ago I had a dream that I was at work (I work at a restaurant), and I had to put away beef broth that we made previously in the day, but I forgot and didn't get it done in time before i had to clock out. I felt very stressed about it my whole shift and even when I went home. I mention this dream because it involves nearly the same ingredient (brown gravy is made with beef broth). 

I have racked my brain and looked up dream interpretation websites, but its hard to look up ""bean burrito with gravy"" lol. Any ideas of what the burrito could represent? ",2023-02-04 22:32:00,1612,True

I had a dream today I can’t remember- but then I woke up feeling like I was in the wrong place. (I was in home but I felt like I left something behind when I woke up). I had this thought pop in my mind - you have a kid here. And I thought of her like it was from a story or something but I couldn’t feel or connect. Like I was in the wrong reality. So I called my kid and hugged her and looked at her and took me 5-10 minutes to feel normal, feel grounded again. Is this normal? Am I overthinking or what? Sorry am a lil freaked out and have nobody to talk to about this weird thing. Thank you for reading so far.",2023-02-04 22:17:38,690,True
96,Dreams,Weird dream of highways in space,"So, I just had some really weird dream, the whole dream basically was me in a car in very advanced and modern highways in the middle of space/universe.
The highways were pretty short and I had no fear whatsoever!

They looked soooooo futuristic and the dream just felt like we’d be on these highways to go to some “higher plane”, it’s almost like I had a very very slight high in the dream!

I also was not driving, bc I don’t drive (where I live, public transport works great and I walk almost everywhere), so I was w someone in the car, and not sure who it was, someone I know, but not someone I know irl in this life!🤷🏼‍♀️

It was kinda cool this dream, has anyone else had such dreams?

Any image created would require me leasing in perpetuity the rights to even create an image, let alone share it. 

My cameras were corporate tools that remotely communicated that I “stole” the sky, trees, rocks. 

Somehow it was the same for painting and drawing, don’t ask me how, but it would be known if landscapes were “stolen” without registering and leasing with corporate permission the sun, moon, grass etc.

I went home and did my normal nightly procedures, I got into bed and watched YouTube videos on my phone until I checked twitch and saw a stream counting down until the sun exploded and I slowly counted down with it looking thru my window and soon enough when the timer hit 0:00 the sun exploded. The night sky lit up in a terrifying but strangely beautiful colorful display as I felt the earth shake, a feeling came over me of dread and fear but also excitement. I checked the stream again and the guy on it said “it will take another 20 seconds until the earth complete dies and falls apart” and their was a live view of the world from a space satellite and parts of the world was breaking off and soon enough my half did and looked up from my phone and felt light headed and a weird feeling in my chest like if you go down a hill in a car, and then everything slowly faded and I woke up in a car.

105,Dreams,Fainting,"There's a small hill at my school. Going down the hill, you'll find a walk way connecting a parking lot directly to the cafeteria. I was walking out of the cafeteria into the pathway when I suddenly felt dizzy. My vision was getting really blurry when an acquaintance caught me asking if I was okay etc. It was really weird, my ears started ringing and kinda feels like something is blocking them. That's when my vision starts tunnelling down slowly until it's all just black. After a few moments, I began to hear my teacher's voice beside me. It sounds like she was talking casually to another teacher passing by us on the walkway. At that point I noticed that I was lying down on the ground but I can't open eyes, until my teacher shook me gently to wake me up. I got up from the ground feeling a little sluggish when I felt that this all not real. As soon as I had that thought I opened my eyes in real life, with me on my bed.

But the other night I had the most realistic nightmare. Basically I was in my bathroom when all of a sudden I felt like my arm was being pushed. Before I could try to get up, I was pushed into my bathtub by a force. I was held down and couldn’t get up. When I could, my bathroom door was being held shut. When I finally got it open, I ran into my room to wake my husband and tell him what happened. He couldn’t understand me and then all of a sudden you could hear in the bathroom (which our room shares a wall with) this growling and screeching and the door banging open and closed. We both looked at each other and screamed. The fear was so real, it was awful. As we were about to run by the bathroom I woke up in a pool of sweat. I hated how real it was. I was even wearing the clothes I wore to bed that night. Still has me freaked out when I think about it. Yuck.",2023-02-04 20:03:26,1004,True

When I was younger the apnea would cause vivid and evil feeling nightmares where I could not speak or wake myself up but would sometimes be able to let out a whine. I’ve just had similar dreams begin again. I suddenly get an evil feeling in my dreams and know that I need to immediately wake up or that I will die. I have trained myself to whine and say help as soon as it comes on, and my partner wakes me up. This has been accompanied this time around with a pounding heart, feeling like my heart stopped and restarted. Sometimes it’s not accompanied by a dream and I wake up with an adrenaline rush feeling like I’m dying and my heart has been stopped, sometimes once a month, sometimes 20 times in a row in one night. I am so exhausted I fall right back asleep and it immediately happens again on loop until it finally stops. I am often afraid to sleep. Sometimes it doesn’t happen for months at a time, then BAM.

I just woke up from a dream where paganism was becoming more prevalent thanks to VR technology with worshippers (mostly Hellenists and Kemetic Worshippers, since the Olympians and the Ennead were onscreen) gathering to pray in peace, but unfortunately Karens and Kens kept barging in and disrupting these services, making the news. Fortunately, people sympathetic to pagans formed barriers to protect them from the Karens. That’s where i left off in the dream

Also, these VR rooms were like party rooms where you paid to spend an allotted amount of time and the Karens and Kens just kept trying to stupidly wipe away the images from the wall that were being projected from a projector.",2023-02-04 18:10:44,742,True

Only until then he said that I was a bit troublesome and disturbing him. So, in the end, I chose to distanced myself from him. My friends even told me that they heard his friends mentioned my name before(after i ignored him).

Now in 2023, I dreamed about him again. The dream was  at my highschool. In a canteen. We gather to talk about something but HE is not there, only his friends. They asked me why I'm not talking to him anymore. So I said ""because he told me I was disturbing him and so on"". Afterwards, they laughed and told me He still care about me and he looked sad, worried and he's not acting like himself after I chose to ignore him. After tht, they told me where he continue his studies at. I WAS SCARED? BECAUSE THE DREAM SEEM REAL 😀

While dreaming I just knew what was going on: a single concept/key idea, from which I had not precise recollection, was moving up and down like a really speedy, crazy elevator. Each stop corresponded to a different set of shapes, with matching colors and quantities -- like they were iterations/uses of the single concept/idea. The single concept/idea was written, but I could not grasp it. At one point, as I've veered towards a lucid state, I told myself that I had been there once before.",2023-02-04 17:46:41,678,True

117,Dreams,Dreamed that my dad was a clone,"I had a strange dream while napping today and I’m trying to figure out what it means. It started off with me in a bright yellow van driving down the road when a random man in front of me hit the car in front of him in his motorcycle and flipped over landing on the ground. I pulled over and offered to give him a ride to the hospital. When he got in the van everything was fine at first but then he tried to assault me. I was able to fight him off and get away. 

I vaguely remember that I was traveling to an amusement park and there were two girls in the van that I’d never seen before. The girls didn’t talk or seem effected by anything that was going on, they just kept looking straight ahead. I kept trying to ensure their safety the whole time. 

In the dream I believed that the man flipped over like that on purpose and was out to get us so now I was on the run from this attacker. I ended up at a random person’s house to hide from him and my parents were there. 

For some reason, I could tell that the person who was my dad was not my dad- he was some sort of evil clone. But he was pretending to be my dad and he looked just like him. 

He was painting a room when I came up with a plan to trick him into revealing that he wasn’t really my dad. So I went into the room where he was painting and I said “remember that time we went to Los Angeles? That was so fun, I want to go back and walk the sunset ****.” Now my family and I have never traveled to Los Angeles so I knew  that if he was my real dad, he would know this. The clone’s response was “yeah, that was a lot of fun.”

So I walked out of the room and told my mom that he was a clone and his response about L.A. and the clone overheard and tried to attack/**** us. We were able to get away. 

When I woke up I saw that I had 6 missed calls from my dad during this dream.

Then I remembered the dream I had months ago. I was walking the same exact path along the river and it was winter and the trees were bare. I told my friend I had a dejavu feeling right before the loud boom. I looked it up later to see if I could find anything out and there’s an air force base kind of far away from here and this particular day they were all over in my direction which is unusual but apparently they were on high alert yesterday because of the Chinese weather balloon situation.

This friend irl is sweet, and not anyone that could be for any reason interested in my finances/money/etc. there was a whole load of other stuff happening, like we were at a shopping centre, we were with a mutual friend who was oblivious to what happened, and this friend was trying to be nice but i wasn’t having it because I’m all like “you tried to empty my bank account, what the ****, I have a job and I work for my money, etc”

my friend and I have spoken about money previously, like just casually about how min wage is going up and we were discussing about her getting a part time job to support herself a bit.

122,Dreams,Dungeon Underneath House,"So I need to share something kinda serious but not like triggering or anything, just really weird. so for the last like 3 years I keep having this dream about some kind of dungeon rooms thats considered ""hidden"" or ""unknown"" underneath my house. I want to know if these kinds of rooms are real or if im just like going insane, or if even anyone else dreams this same kind of dream.

The point of the dream is that these stone rooms are like really old, and maybe even apart of an older house that was bulldozed and the modern house (could be your house, or mine) was built on top of. Usually in this dream, I (or you) would discover that these rooms exist, and go down it. At the bottom or near bottom, you discover that someone is living there, or used to live there. But how tf would they live there when this whole thing is supposed to be like hidden? They might even be using modern appliances like lights, or a fridge, even though there seems to be no plugs for electricity. Electricity was not a thing when this was made.

Also, the vibe of the dream is not nightmarish, but more curiosity that humans have when rediscovering something really old and unknown to knowledge beforehand, everytime i have this dream I feel like I am discovering something made over 2000 years ago.

First picture is a concept of this structure of this dungeon or ""hidden"" part of the house.

Second picture is what each room looks like, mostly uninhabited. There's usually around 10-12 of these rooms, with no light at all inside, so usually you have to bring your phone in and take photos.

Last photo is what the staircase would look like.

124,Dreams,Does this dream mean anything or is my brain just on one?,"        So I had this odd dream and need help deciphering. For reference I almost NEVER dream, maybe mayyyybbe once a year kind of thing. So I’m like talking to some girl about a get together type thing and I’m like f it, I’ll walk to it to see you. So I walk and walk, and there is like a gated entrance that’s open to where the meetup is.

       There are some old heads outside and I ask them if girl is here, they don’t know but they tell me the main party is ahead and the “rejects” party is out here. To my right is a small garage type deal with 4-6 alt people in it. I don’t remember past that point or if I find the girl I go to meet (not in the “rejects” and I don’t recall ever entering) Then I have a part two to this dream, twice.

       In the second part I believe girl and her family were meeting up with me and I was at some couples house I don’t recall ever being to. The couple was a 30-40 something black man and a fit ~50 y/o white woman. It starts getting hazy, I remember hugging the white woman and the family arriving. The man wanted to trap the family or attack them or something. I was very opposed but I don’t believe I did anything. 

       I had the dream again after waking up for like 15 mins, and I believe I was lucid during this one as I set up ice on the pathway to and from the house and warned the family upon arrival, specifically said girl and her (older brother?) anyways, I just wanna know if there’s any meaning to derive or if it was just an odd dream?",2023-02-04 15:07:19,1498,True

When I was younger I was always the spectator, watching rather than living. Now I’m literally in my body experiencing everything. I don’t think this is lucid dreaming because I believe that means I would be able to control what’s happening. I’m writing this because sometimes I will wake up and feel exhausted. Probably because my body or consciousness feels like it was never asleep. I mean for a little after I wake up my body feels very strange, almost confused that the dream wasn’t reality.

I go outside to inspect the damage. There's a burnt patch on the lawn. A battery hangs in the windshield of my car connected to the corners by a thin stretch of wire. This is what attracted the electric bolt, I reason, and cut the wires. I inspect the car, finding several rivets that have been melted by the flash. I look at the lawn again.

**Feb. 1, 2023–** I was on this massive ship or house overlooking a major body of water. It was multi story and architectural. I found a dog and was with someone. There may have been a boat in the shape of a stingray set to auto navigate somewhere important or set to some treasure. This person and I were just hanging out when multiple robbers came up. They clearly thought the space was empty. The person, dog and I ran. The dog's collar was noisy, which made me nervous. We made it to the elevator unseen and got on it just in time–but it was glass/ see-through and the robbers saw us on \[word unreadable\]. We got to the third floor and found a room full of suitcases. I tried to fit the dog in one but it was stuffed. We hid there for a moment before running back to the ship–we almost left the ship again but had to flee and finally found grass nd other people–I think the robbers were stopped. The dog somehow had powers.

136,Dreams,a girl and trouble,"dreams journal
 Jan 31 '22
 I dreamed of seeing a school girl, maybe she was the same age as me.  She is seen being bullied by a group of boys.  In front of the school gate, maybe she was injured because she looked scared.
 She tried to pull herself out of their grip.  And ran as hard as she could and then climbed the high enough gate.  Which is enough to amaze me.
 They ran after her, luckily the girl was very good at running away from them.  I ran ahead of them, trying to blend into one of them.
 In front of the fences that were pulled up from the outside, I acted like I was being stucked or pinned down to restrain them.  Give the girl a little time to escape further.
 Felt it was enough to hold them back.  The gate opened, letting two people in with me.  They stopped to see where the girl had gone.  They are confused to lose track of her.
 I took out a butterfly knife out, weird.. they didn't suspect it when I took that thing.  I felt my body filled with heat, I didn't want to do it, but a voice told me to.  My hand moved and stab the knife into the chest of the person on my left, and then into the throat of the other person.
 I turned my eyes, I saw a teacher in front of me. Seem familiar to me, and I don't know why  I looked at her with a smirk on my face.
 I woke up just with my eyes open, not like jumping out of bed or freaked out. And I just like ' nope, I don't want to know what happened in that dream next'. Although I sometimes dreams about other bad thing that I did.  But it's different for this one.
And I asked to myself.
 who is that girl?
 why did i save her? or am i?
 does she need help?
 am i going insane?
do i need help?",2023-02-04 13:07:05,1665,True

My great Aunt was a Freud-trained analyst and has had a dream decyphering 
innovation based on Kabbalah where rabbis used an inner family system with Father Son Mother and Daughter...these inner roles had colours - father critical [ black] son = healer [ red] Mom [ balance in blue] and Sister/Virgo green [ as toxic symptoms].
She had 4 historical figures in each colour [ like Card colours with 4 numbers]- each also hinting at emotional healing functions. 

So here is an example:
First Poirot the detective is a Kabbalist.
He is a healer: Son = red
Second. War starts I say bye to ex-wifes.
These are moms = blue
Third. I say to exwife guru that shouting 
Parents create pervert setups.
This is a symptom hence green.
Four. Cogwheel train and a rope if someone dislikes trains.
It is a critique of traffic so it is fathering hence black.

The numbers can be done by adding each words' letters. So each card having an ABC letters we do have a word - a dream message. [I will go out/ leave  from the task of mentioning it as it has meaning only for me.

She has had theories from Kabbalists about the colours being hints at different ancestral generations...Although today we do have computer proofs about colour usage frequency that differs in each generation [ in those times her husband, a generational historian had said each lasts 25 years and now we do have statistics about magnetic sunwind having such a perioficity - it is still not accepted generally by historians.]",2023-02-04 13:06:00,1535,True

139,Dreams,The most wired dream you ever had Hi everybody.," so i had this strange   dream which was felt like a sense of lack of gravity and believe me it was as real as not having any gravity(: so basically you feel upside down and dizzy ,having this in your mind .I eventually start to have strange series of dream it was like your soul( not that i have one but for describing better ) was getting out of your body and practically not like out of body experience and these kind of  dreams. And when my soul was comming out my neurons kind of vibrating in my head and before the process of leaving body was completed in my dream i woke up and during this i saw like white and blue light like staring directly into sun but in my dream .after another experience a dream like this but instead with a different story and in the last one it finally happened … as i go through the story of dream at some point i reached a black board and the gravity was shut down i was looking  Precisely at something that was written on black board and after that i saw  device with lenses i drawn into it (absorbed) and what happened was like a black hole ! it was surprising to me cause the only way possibly to experience a blackhole and survive  is to dream it .what i didn’t know in my previous dream was that what would happen if my soul would completely get out my body in dream how things go in that point and here it is a blackhole . Some other things to mention is that dreams kind of make sense even though not full logically like when my alarm rings and i don’t wake up i dream of an alarm clock . so the main question is what is this (iam kind of curious) and my muscles were shaking during this dream and even after i woke up like pulling into this shredding black hole my hand just move on their own and do you know something like this or similar to this one ?",2023-02-04 12:50:07,1796,True
142,Dreams,Dream Bath,"Important notes I've been sick with a cold and took some medicine before I slept. Now the dream... I was at a party with lots of random people. Some would talk to me like we were friends. It was in a trailer, the mobile home kind, and there was a section full of couches and chairs then a dining area and a small bathroom and master bedroom in the back. This one **** kept hitting on me and I got tired of it so I moved to the dining area. I laugh and took a couple shots before thinking I need to keep looking. I stop at the bathroom to see a guy taking a bath in black jeans. Casually throwing bubbles on himself but there wasn't many bubbles. I continued to the bed room and there was a guy laying back there. He sat up and smiled at me. He asked if I wanted to dip in the hot tub. I said yeah but there isn't one. He said there was I just needed to think harder... so I thought harder and imagined an indoor hot tub right outside the room and sure enough one appeared. (Pretty sure I just took control of my dream for a second there) we got in the hot tub and everything was fine until a guy started yelling that everything was wrong. I got zapped to the start of my dream and I rushed to the back only to notice he was back in the bed but my hot tub was getting destroyed. It was rotting away from the house and no one seemed to care. Bed guy walked up to me and said sometimes this happens. It's going to be ok. And then I woke up!

144,Dreams,Dream help,"I would really appreciate some help after a troubling dream. 

I had a dream of my deceased grandfather last night. In life he was abusive to my mother, her siblings, and my grandmother and caused them a lot of chaos and trauma. 

But I saw him in my dream, even though he didn’t look like he did in life, he was ragged and just didn’t look like him but I knew it was him. He was angry and yelling at me, about what I don’t know. Behind his back I would go to a room that held his trophies and pieces of his life, and I was trying to look for something but I couldn’t find it. 

My girlfriend was there with me, and for some reason in my dream she was trying to help me look for whatever I was trying to find in my grandfather’s stuff but we couldn’t find it. 

My grandmother, who is alive and my grandfather’****-wife, appeared for a bit and I remember being in tears in my dream, then I woke up. 

I didn’t know my grandfather very well because my mom’s side lives in Ukraine, and it just wasn’t easy to get there for my family. I met him once when I was three, and he died when I was eleven. 


I don’t know what this means, or if it means anything at all, but it’s been in my head and I can’t get it out, and it’s been heavy on my heart. 

I’d appreciate any insight or input that anyone has. Opinions and all.

I'm part of a secret society of street-dancers, and when the judges get here, maybe we can do the first test together."" I said I wasn't ready, because IRL I don't dance very much, but then two people in fashionable streetwear approached, and me and the girl started doing this synchronized hiphop dance that I don't remember anything about except it involved a lot of footwork, like some kind of hiphop tap-dancing, and I didn't really find it impressive or artistic, it felt like something kids would do in elementary school.

They all said I was really good and started treating me like an expert, and then they said ""let's go over inside the subway and you can show us a solo routine you've been working on"" and I panicked and came up with something on the spot. I vividly remember the dance that I did, sorta like Mohammed Ali ducking and weaving but with really exaggerated hip  movements and feet pointing inward. I thought it was really good. But then the guy just exploded at me, like ""what the **** was that? Are you **** 19 or something? I guess it's either destroy or delete with you,"" (I think 'destroy' meant like 'destroy it on the dance floor) and I asked ""really? You think the last one was so bad it should be deleted?""

150,Dreams,I dreamt two lovers were handcuffed to each other to keep themselves in check. What does this mean?,"Full dream:

Had a dream me and some old family friends found this cabin in the woods. It was very well furnished but plain. We all decided to sleep in there for the night. We ended up sharing great memories together and I felt like it was the ""gold ol' times"" again. I even ended up texting this girl who I thought could be into me.

However, I kept wondering if the old man would come back. What if he was upset we slept in his cabin? What if he tried to **** us?

Later that morning I ended up leaving the cabin and going downhill to town. I found a small open pavilion. Inside were a young man and a young woman, handcuffed together. They were formerly a band but had fallen on some hard times. The man was a **** addict, and the woman had mental health problems. They said they handcuffed themselves together just to keep the ofher in check. They were surrounded by a lot of garbage too, mostly their own.
I tried offering them some words of comfort, and they offered me **** in return. I refused initially: I didn't want the camp uphill to smell the ****. So instead I took edibles candies.

I discovered that the music they made was pretty good. I wondered how they did stuff together if they were handcuffed, and what they'd be like if they were free.",2023-02-04 11:12:38,1259,True
151,Dreams,Strange house,"I rent a room in a large, multi level home. I'm playing a game in the living room area with 3 of my roommates. On one of my turns, I'm given the option to cut the nose of one of my roommates with a knife. I decide not to do so. She gets angry at me, and tells me that I needed to do that to her so she could get a lot of views on social media. She said I needed to figure out something else to do to her since I didn't slice up her nose.

I go into my room. Half of it is a typical bedroom layout, the other half is a kitchen/bathroom that seems to have been last updated in the 70s (it seems like, though I'm not too great at styles from each decade). I explore this area a bit. The kitchen was still functioning and had a lot of food and drink in it, but the bathroom was not. It was dusty and had a lot of mildew, just didn't want to touch that area in general. 

Near the bathroom, I notice a set of stairs. I was on the second floor already, and didn't know there were more. I go up them, and have just a couple steps from getting to the third floor, when I hear a bunch of banging against a wall or floor. Then, a kid starts yelling ""Help!""

I run back down and decide that's what I'm going to do with my roommate for views. I go in the kitchen to find some food first. A group of 4-5 girls come in from one of the bedrooms down the hall and grab food as well. I mention going upstairs for views, but I said I needed to shower first. 

I go into one of the other bathrooms of the house, and in it, I see a sectioned off area with a hot tub in it. There are 5 guys in it, I guess I was supposed to be in there 3 hours earlier with them for a spa day. I join them after fully stripping down. A few moments later, a super hot guy joins and sits right next to me. He starts touching me down there while I do the same to him.",2023-02-04 11:03:32,1826,True

So today I woke up early thinking I had to go to work and ended up not having too because it’s Saturday, so went back to bed and drifted off. While dreaming about random stuff like jumping and going into endless buildings I found this set of (industrial?) sets that led down into an old abandoned area blocked off by a green door, I took a look inside and saw nothing but old concrete to my right but I felt feared when I was about to look to my left and ran back up the stair as fast as I could, while running I could feel my legs actually start getting tired like I was actually running for real. Then I thought I woke up but suddenly my body was numb and I couldn’t move at all, couldn’t even open my eyes, the light outside my window was bright and all I could hear was an audience laughing outside my window, while I was trying to open my eyes something in the back of my mind told me whatever you do DONT OPEN THEM YET! So I hesitated while still completely numb. While numb it felt like I could go through my own body like if I touched my chest I could grab my heart. Anyways the laughter persisted and panic started to set in so the catholic in me prayed and touched my chest and I just woke up. Keep in mind I was practically awake through this whole ordeal, I wasn’t fully a sleep but wow I’m definitely gonna pray a bit more before bed or something because man that was terrible.",2023-02-04 10:44:19,1471,True
154,Dreams,Nightmares featuring lights,"I noticed that recently I've been having a lot of nightmares centred around lights, in particular lights switching on/changing modes/etc of their own accord. They always take place wherever I'm currently sleeping, which makes them quite difficult to discern from reality. In my own apartment, I have a set of artificial candles (battery operated) which feature in these dreams. I recently visited my family home and stayed a couple nights in my old bedroom, and the dreams then featured a cactus shaped lamp that I have there. 

Honestly I'm not even sure what exactly makes them nightmares, as they aren't even all that eventful. They begin abruptly, where the light in question will suddenly switch itself on. When the dreams feature the candles, I then use a remote to turn them off, but they turn back on by themselves almost immediately. While I was at my family home, the cactus lamp in these dreams would already be on, as I typically have it on before settling to sleep. It emits a dim green light. In the dreams, the light would keep switching to red. I'd panic and try to turn it back, but, like with the candles, it'd change again almost immediately. 

Doesn't really sound like a nightmare on the surface and I honestly struggle to articulate what makes it one. It's such a small thing but it feels so stressful. The more I try and fail to turn off the light, the more I panic, I feel like the walls are closing in on me, my movements get more frantic and desperate but it still doesn't work. When my partner visits, and I sleep alongside her, she has noticed that I'll become noticeably distressed in my sleep,  and she has to wake me up to calm me down. 

I can't even describe what's so scary about it. It just sets off this immense panic and leaves me feeling shaken and unsettled for hours after waking. I have a feeling of being trapped there in the dream. I don't tend to ascribe too much meaning to dreams but this one is really bothering me for some reason. I don't know why it's happening or how to make it stop.",2023-02-04 10:38:33,2034,True

I distinctly remember feeling quite triumphant and telling myself wow this is definitely astral projection. Then for some reason, it takes me forever to ‘fall’ back into my own body. Like I know that is what I’m doing but the feeling of being back took longer than expected.

Next moment, I’m projecting again but this time towards the ceiling. I recoil as I get closer to the ceiling thinking I’m about to get squashed because I couldn’t stop myself from gliding upwards. Only, I went into and through the ceiling like a ghost and into a dark, underground parking-like area. It’s a little hazy after this point and I woke up fully not long after.

When she was very young she got sick and was subsequently unable to have kids. She married in her 20s but was divorced. She ended up living past 100.

168,Dreams,Short dream about dogs that bite but it doesn't hurt,"Had a dream I was in a mall, just hanging out and I ended up running into this boy. He was attractive but very blunt. He was a dog walker and had a fleet of dogs with him. I go to pet one and he tells me to not pet them because they'll bite. But I'm already petting them, and they start biting me. I scream with my hand in the dogs mouth until I realize it doesn't hurt. They just keep biting but I don't care and think they're cute. They slowly stop biting and just let me pet them. The guy gets mad and tells me to go away. I'm confused. He starts walking away and the dogs follow. I end up walking to the parking lot and get stopped by the mall cop. Security starts chasing me until I'm out in front of the mall. I come to a stop and see a circle of dogs with a body in the middle. The body is the boy from earlier but now he's a girl. The girl is dead. What does this mean? Also, I've never been bitten by a dog so this was odd.",2023-02-04 07:08:09,932,True

172,Dreams,Drempt a sleepwalked and offended my Dad...,"For context I haven't lived with my parents for 4 years so I didn't actually sleepwalk and it was in my childhood house that we're no longer in. . 
This was all from the perspective of everyone in the house (mum, brother, dad) not speaking to me and me not knowing why. My dad was at work and my mum was home and I asked her why she wasn't speaking to me, she said ""you know why"" and I really didn't....I finally got my mum to tell me what happened and she said I told my dad this morning before he left for work (5am) something really bad (I didn't actually know what I said) in the kitchen right before he left - my reaction to it was complete shock and was crying saying ""I would never do that!"". Hours go by and my mum has come around to the idea that I wouldn't actually do that and I must have been sleepwalking, I'm still shocked but also nervous for when my dad comes home. He comes home, isn'tspeaking to me, calls me a disgrace etc. etc.... me and my mum try to persuade him but I'm getting angry because how can I be accountable for something that I was onconscious for, how can I be accountable for a dream - really got into the ethics and morals of blaming something on someone why knew nothing about. Anyway, dad came around and agreed it wasn't my fault but then I started thinking what of someone killed someone whilst sleepwalking and they have 0 recollection and are tried like they were black out **** or something.",2023-02-04 06:16:27,1434,True

Robots are came and came, then I saw a canister with some sort of fuel in cart, I just push it to the bomb, after ten seconds all around slowed down, air shrunken and then explosion.

I saw fire came closer to me, but I didn't care, I just felt that it already happened to me, my body dissolved, everything around me become black void, and I steel felt my limbs. But darkness became bright, I don't know how, but all around was like black void, with like black marble floor, and then there was person, in my mind was only one idea that this was ****, I came behind him and start to do ghost noises, but he didn't pay attention but I knew he heard them, then some woman came to him, and I felt that I have choice, I didn't remember others, but one of them was to wake up. 

This was crazy, when I woke I wrote all down, because I still feel like I or maybe other me died tonight, and this was really what is death feel like, and what come after that.

174,Dreams,really weird dream i just had,"My dreams are usually weird but this was one of the weirdest i could remember, 

It's starts with my my family in the living room suddenly i see my aquarium that apparently i have (I don't have fish pets irl) glowing and 3 weird fish guys (i forgot to add but they weren't like mermaids they had human body and fish features and a fish head) comes out of it. They were blue and had like a black kind of cape
And i don't remember what they did they just disappeared and me and i was REALLY surprised and got creeped out from that thing and apparently this is a trend now to summon these weird human fish demons and they supposed to give us missions to complete (I don't know what we're supposed to get if we complete it all) and if you summon then abd you won't complete your mission ""they will make you disappear from earth"" (my mind literally had me see an ad explaining this thing).

So for some reason my friends summoned them at ny house and they give them missions and i was really really scared from this thing and the whole dream i tried tell people that thus is bad news and nothing good will come from this but no one listened. So everytime they cane to ny house summoned them and got missions i hid under my bad and almost got an panic attack.

So one of the missions were to **** a dog and guess who's dog they chose? Mine. So i took my dog hugged her and defended her with my body until the fish demons left and i tried to protect her 

and for some reason the scene changed and i was at a party and when i was done i couldn't find my dog, so i ran to my home and found my mom near a strange container with bodies in it and one of them was my dog's (there also was 2 minion bodies (?)) And i was yelling and all this and my mom saying ""wait and see"" suddenly every of the bodies are alive including my dog's and they escape apparently my mom tried to save them because people killed them because of that strange fish guys

And then a gif of my dog run from there with minions appear Infront of my eyes and it was written ""succes"" with this meme font, and i woke up.

Does this thing has a meaning? It was really really strange and i was like: ****? When i wake up from this what do you think about this thing? It feels like it supposed to mean something but it's too strange",2023-02-04 06:06:32,2286,True

178,Dreams,"I had a dream with Aphrodite and an anonymous male god and I ""didn't pass the test""","Hello

I keep having vivid dreams more recently, and more often than not they are scary. But today I had a dream that I was walking on a busy street and then I was suddenly stopped by some type of policeman holding a gun. I surrendered but knew I didn't do anything. Next thing I know I am in a green lush garden and there is a man and a woman there, I knew they were a **** and goddess, the woman being Aphrodite specifically. 

They were both **** if I recall correctly, but I didn't pay much attention to it. What I do remember is Aphrodite asking me something and I answered, don't know the topic but I kept saying positive things. Then I got this feeling that I did not pass the test and everything started feeling weird and scary.

Now I was put in an institution against my will and I tried to escape several times, but the man from the street kept stopping me from escaping. I did manage to escape somehow, after three or four tries, but I also remember unexplainable sceneries from my escape plan, with huge platforms and the only route outside was next to a weird airplane. So I tried escaping from there but the airplane passengers kept saying ""The plane is full!"". I didn't pay attention to them.

While I was trying to escape, the man from the street transformed into a weird humanoid creature (idek) and some other ""security"" men also transformed. Like demons I guess? But I didn't process it like that in my dream. There was a lot more stuff going on and I always remember my dreams in quite good detail, but I don't think it would change anything if I wrote down the whole shebang here. Anyways I did manage to escape..I think lol.",2023-02-04 04:31:38,1647,True
179,Dreams,I had a very vivid dream and am trying to figure out the meaning,"So about 2 weeks ago now, I had this dream, and it was uncharacteristically vivid. (as the title says). For a decent amount of it, I think I understand the meanings behind the details;  
  Starts off in my dad's truck, we're driving down a highway. The driver was my new boss, and we were chatting about something unimportant. He then tells me that he needs to stop at the store and get his dad a gun. so we go to the store, which is a mix of some local grocery store and walmart. We skip to back in the car. I'm holding the items bought. Notably, and it was pointed out of my through focus of POV, The gun isn't a gun. (this is the first detail that I dont understand. it was made clearly important by the dream and was basically highlighted) After that, There was construction ahead, so my boss went off-road thru the construction site to get around it. Down the highway we went. This time tho, we were ""talking about something important""(The second detail I can't grasp. it was again almost shoved down my throat that it was important.) The dream then focuses more on the surrounding area around the highway, with the perspective having changed occasionally thru the  dream. The final detail I couldnt grasp; The surrounding area and landscape was ""importantly unimportant""

TL;DR:  
in dreams what do the following mean:  
""-A gun that isnt a gun""  
""-An important conversation with no details present.""  
&amp; -""A landscape that is importantly unimportant""",2023-02-04 04:03:52,1462,True
180,Dreams,Dreaming but still able to see the real life??,"I just woke up and I had the weirdest dream and I'm not sure which parts are not real. I was dreaming that my vision was stuck. I was able to move around freely and talk with other people but my vision was just frozen. The thing that's confusing me is that my vision was stuck on the exactly same thing I saw when I woke up. And what is even more confusing is the vision in my dream got lighter/darker because of the sun and clouds through my window which is exactly what's happening in real life. Is it possible that my eyes are open and looking but every other aspect of my body is asleep?

181,Dreams,Don't know how to stop my nightmares,"I would like to share some experiences I had with nightmares and I don't know how it's possible.( I'm sorry if it's not the right sub I'm new on Reddit). I would really like to know what you think about it. I'm French so I'm sorry for my English and for the long story.

It begins when we moved to our family house when I was 5. From the day we arrived at this house, I was totally unable to go upstairs alone and this until I was 13 or 14 years old. I'm still uncomfortable with the idea of being alone upstairs there and I'm 28 now. It's not a creepy house at all, it's a house that was built by my parents so it was new when we moved in. I still don't understand why, it really makes no sense.

I always had big issues to sleep and had multiple different habits that lasted for periods of time. Once I had to sleep with my door open and the light outside on, after I had to have absolutely no light and the door close (it didn't last long) and after that (still the same today) I have to close my door and sleep with lights on or at least outside light coming into my room. My shutter have to be open and my bed have to be against a wall. I moved in different places through years and it was always the same everywhere.

My point is, since I can remember, every nights I have one or more nightmares, some bad and some terrifying to the point I woke up screaming and sweating. It also happen that some nights, I don't see anything in those nightmares, only a lot of voices screaming together in my head until I wake up. I can have a nightmare one night and it continue like one week or more in another nightmare, like I remember in my second nighmare what exactly happened in the first one.  It was always like that and I was terrified enough to not want to sleep at all. My mother kept repeating me that we can't have nightmares two nights in a row but it keeps happenings even today, I think I never had a night without nightmare. Even if I take a small nap like 20 or 30 minutes, I'll have a nightmare. 
I nearly have only nightmares that are totally unrelated to my real life, but when they are related to it I am not able to know if it was true or only a nightmare. It make me doubt of the reality of some of my memories quite often. Like I receive some messages or have a terrible conversations with people that never existed but in my mind it will appear as something that I really lived. I have no way to know what really happened or not. 

So when I was like 12 or 13 maybe, I had a routine before going to bed. My room was always extremely tidy to not be scared by a strange shape during the night. I had to check in all of my closets, shutting their doors, checking under my desk and under my bed and rechecking if everything was at its place. I had the lights on and the only way for me to fall asleep at the time was by reading a book. So that night I fell asleep like this with the light on like everyday. I did a nightmare where I was someone else in my house, probably an adult and a man. All the lights were off and as this other person I was walking through the house with a big knife in my hand. I took the stairs going to my room and opened the door discretly. When I entered the light was off. I tried to go next to the bed where I saw my real me sleeping, but I tripped over the rugthat make my real me waking up in the dream. I really woke up at this moment in the reality and the light was off. When I turned it on again, the rug was turned over exactly as it was in my dream. It scared me a lot cause it was impossible that I turned the light off and let my carpet like this after my routine. I could not go back to sleep for at least an hour but I finished to try again, closing my eyes. At this moment I heard someone, a woman, calling my name but strangely it did not make me open my eyes. She called me normally twice and screams very loudly my name followed by ""wake up"" the third time. So I opened my eyes again and was too scared to try to sleep again this night. No one was awake in the house, I asked my family in the morning if someone entered my room or called me or heard something that night but they all say no.

Another time, when I was younger like 7 or 8, I was sleeping at my grandparents house like I did every school holidays. At this time I was so afraid to sleep alone that I slept in the room my brother slept in too. My bed was next to his against the wall. Every nights, my grandmother read us a story and waited until I finally felt asleep. I put systematically my head under the blanket with a little hole to breath, rolling up the blanket under my feet to not let anything passing under. I woke up during the night for no reason and I noticed one of my arms was hanging out of bed. Strangely I didn't put it back under the blanket and I tried to go back to sleep. At the moment I closed my eyes I felt something caressing my hand softly so I opened my eyes trying not to move at all. Instant later, the thing gripped my hand and pull my arm under the bed hard enough to make my shoulder off the bed. I took back my arm under the blanket, chocked and I listened really carefully during the rest of the night, not able to move or call my grandparents. But nothing could be heard appart from my brother breathing. When the sun lighted the room I finally find the courage to get out of the bed and look under but there was nothing.

Some years ago, my sister were travelling in New Zeland, I only knew this, I didn't had a lot of news from her, I wanted to let her enjoy her trip. One night, I had a really terrifying dream where I was someone else, I entered in something that was maybe a church or something like that and I started to shoot at people there with an assault riffle, I killed nearly everyone there, it was horrifying. I woke up sweating, not able to move for a long moment. When I finally moved I look at my phone and my mother sent a message on the family group discussion couple of minutes before I checked, asking my sister if she was safe. I asked why she was asking and she told me that my sister was in Christchurch and there were a terrorist attack where a lot of people were killed. It was such a strange feeling cause the nightmare seemed at this point more real. The strangest part is that, as I can remember, it was only the second time I was not myself in one of my dreams, with the one I told previously.

Most recently, like 1 or 2 years ago, it was not creepy but I had been able to find my credit card after I lost it cause I saw in a dream it was inside a seat in my car. I searched there just after waking up and it was there. 

Thank you if you read this until the end. I hope it's clear enough for you to understand. If you are willing to tell me what you think about that I'd like to hear it, or something that can make me stop having nightmares all the time it can be great, I would really appreciate to have a real rest once ! (It's only a small part of what I experienced with my nightmares)",2023-02-04 03:00:00,6982,True

Well today I dreamed that I had gotten a new sibling and that I assumed it was dead so I took his head off. I walked around with his head for a little bit and decided to attach it back. The baby who now also have gotten a name woke up and I got very happy. I immediately picked up the baby and held him with so much love and the baby was happy. After that I was sitting at the table and told my siblings that I feel peak love for my new baby brother and I don’t love them as much as him. That’s when I woke up.

we made pizza like pizza in the microwave so my sister/girlfriend cant remember called me to eat and my big brother was there too. He had some hatred to me ever since we were kids and he ruined my life tbh. Out of nowhere he was choking me but I got out my sister/gf kicked his elbow. And then I started choking him till he died. After that everything started getting worse.

Psycho mother

Another mother came to **** me because she wanted revenge for her son that I apparently killed she acted like she was a friend of ours talked with my mother and then went back outside. little did I know that she didnt close the door..So the moment I reached to close the door (with a knife of course) Thats when she took her chance opened the door came rushing to **** us with her knife but my sister pushed her and she fell into my knife. (I fell too I got scared).

Son 

Now the oldest son came for revenge but that was unexpected because I thought that the mother only had 1 son. My cousin was watching tv and the door wasnt locked because I was so scared and didnt know what to do. There comes the oldest son I ran into the living room and he kicked it open, I ran to the toilet and used my cousin as bait to create some time so I could call the  police. I was struggling to lock the toilet door with a key my hands were shaking so much. The son was threathning to **** my cousi, I scream ""IF U **** TAKE 1 MORE STEP OR **** HIM IM CALLING THE POLICE"" of course I couldnt do **** cuz all I wanted to do was lock the door. It finally worked the relieve.. I was about to call the cops but I was so scared I even forgot their number so I searched on google LOL.

That's it I woke up heavy breathing and sweathing with shaking hands.

I guess the moral of the dream is to lock your door.",2023-02-04 01:45:52,1789,True
188,Dreams,Dream with weird details,"Next week I have my analyst session. 

First of all in my dream Poirot had a Kabbalist name. [ Suchet is the actor with a Jewish family name, and I watch it daily]. 688 is the numerical version - added up it is a 4. [ in Kabbalah we have 4s - like 4 generations or family members or body parts...like it is used in r/freud.]...of course there are 4 mental issues and healing tools too...But first let us see the 3 remaining dream parts.

Saying  goodbye to the women in my life due to war mobilisation. [ My ancestors fled Ukraine - and all gender identity switches - including going to the army a macho role - are the way our unconscious subjectivity wants to emerge before vanishing again behind the ego-illusion]

I explain to a guru-like ex-partner woman that yes, true, anyone whose father shouts will have pervert traits [ which includes a rebellion against dad and creating new personal rules].

Than I see a cogwheel train and also a rope if someone prefers to go alone on foot. A woman kicks me. [ This hints at my asocial and asex pre ego positions]

Now I have an analyst great aunt who was learning with Freud - so I use her method of intuition [ helped by colours]...so the Poirot image is a Heler [= red the Son in Kabbalah] the war thing is blue [daily motherly rules]...and the pervert part is a symptom hint so it is green [ toxic..the sister role in rivalries] and the train hints at a critique on train [= masses] and it is black [= father function].

So the 4 dream parts belong to Father 4  son 6 mom 9 and sister 8.
She used it with a Memory Card Deck...and so she had an ABC letter on each card...hence she could find a word [ in Hebrew] in each dream and claimed the word being a message from the Unconscious maybe...each card had a function - one of the 4 basic healing paths. Of course this was a playful creative method to teach basic freudist [ or Kabbalist] psychological concepts but she died in 55  before she could find any recognition - her husband worked in the founding process of UNESCO but he also died very early - in 47  before the official starting - to have any impact although there were many  other pedagogy projects that were accepted later by them.

It is a simplified draft of course...my great aunt tried to persuade some colleagues...but they rejected this playful idea....i think i am the only person taking it up after finding hints on this in family letters and diaries.

I do have a few friends who someone ask me to use this kabbalist freudism. So if someone sends me a dream [ that has 4 distinct elements] I am willing to show how it can be done.",2023-02-04 01:34:29,2601,True

Anyone else have similar broken leg dreams?",2023-02-04 00:44:18,491,True
193,Dreams,Dream Analysis,"So I need some understanding with my dreams. I will start off by saying there are 3 scenes in this dream.

1st: I was in the kitchen of my old house and in my was was a very tiny kitten. But what stood out to me was this baby cat had very long nails.

2nd: I was driving a car and came to a stop. Only to check on my dog in the back seat, to see if there was anything wrong. (I don’t own a dog)

3rd: I was walking around a department store. No idea what I was looking for or wanted to buy.

Any information on this dream will be greatly appreciated. Thank you",2023-02-04 00:42:26,560,True
194,Dreams,Dreamt of my ex does it mean anything,"

Me and my ex broke up in the middle of December I contacted her in the beginning of January and she said she's dating someone else that makes her happy. It **** me up but I parted ways with her in a peaceful way. Yesterday morning I woke up from a weird dream.  we were in a room with her family and her mom had a baby in her arms I wasant sure if it was her mom's  or mine and my ex's but when that baby would look at her and me she would have the most beautiful smile and she was so adorable.and I was talking to my ex like if we were together and I told her ima marry you. She asked me is that really what I want I said yea and she she had a beautiful **** smile and was blushing ode. I asked her do I need to ask permission to marry you from your parents and she said just from her mom. And it was just amazing I was gonna ask her mom permission and then I woke up. It was an insane dream it felt crazy to wake up and be in reality. There are times I miss her and want her back but there are other times I'm disgusted by the thought of her and don't feel comfortable thinking about her, before this dream i wasant thinkingabout her for a while so it was really unexpected.  Could this dream be a premonition of the future or could my mind just be playing tricks on me.",2023-02-04 00:31:58,1274,True

She showed me all of her huge house plants she looked after for the “lady of the house”. They were some beautiful plants, and she said how she had raised them with care and love from the brink of death. 
And then she turned into my mother. And she was pushing me into a big ****, and she was watering me, telling me she’d take care of me and raise me to be beautiful too. I couldn’t talk or move, the water and the soil were getting into my nose and mouth, my eyes stung. I woke up and I cried a lot.",2023-02-03 23:53:40,577,True
196,Dreams,Dream about witnessing a shooting?,"My dream: I was in the basement of a barroom and puttering around waitressing. Suddenly in the back corner I saw 2 Mafia-looking men pull out their shotguns, twirl them around their fingers, then point them in unison at the GROIN of an older Mafia-looking man who was sort of frumpy and whom I felt somewhat sorry for. 

The older man stayed still, as he knew there was nothing he could do. He knew he either deserved this, or ""had it coming"". 

All the customers and everyone left, silently walking up the stairs (we knew not to run). I, of course, was last in line and felt like I was trudging through water. I was scared I wouldn't get out in time... they might come after me. And for some reason, no one including me would be surprised. 

As I, the last one, disappeared out of the basement, I heard a single muffled shot. It was HORRIBLE. I woke up very disturbed.

&amp;#x200B;

I'm in a situation in my real life where I just compromised my integrity to my enemies. They loved this, and are very sick and evil, and I have felt hopeless - as though I cannot now reach my destiny. It Wass done in private and I believe they will hang me with this. It also ruined my relationship with the people I love in my life (very painful). 

Writing this out might've just helped me see more about why I had this dream. Any input (even totally different than what I'm thinking) is VERY welcome. Even if you think it would ""hurt"" me. I just want to truth. Thank you.",2023-02-03 23:04:15,1459,True

198,Dreams,Dream of being comforted by death,"Hello everyone!

Context: I never post on reddit, but I just had such a vivid dream and I wanna know what it means. Recently I haven’t been in a great mental space (I have a mixture of bpd and schizophrenia + depression + anxiety) and I’ve having episodes of derealization. 

The dream: I was on a team of superhero’s and for some reason I kept having panic attacks and couldn’t stop freaking out during the mission. One of the girls on the team was just listening to me explain why I was upset and then mid-sentence I realized it was a dream. I said to her “What’s going on? Why is this happening?” and she said, “Your brain is just going through what it feels like it needs to go through” I then wake in my house (i’m still dreaming) and I’m still sobbing uncontrollably. I fall back asleep and then I’m in a wear house and I see death from the new **** in boots movie (i haven’t watched it yet) he’s coming after me saying “I have to face the truth” and tried to show me something. I didn’t want to see it and was terrified, I tried looking for an exit. There was none and when he finally caught me and was about to show me, but I turned into a child version of myself and pleaded with him to not show me. His demeanor changed entirely and started comforting me. He gave me a hug and we talked for a bit. I woke back up in my dream home but immediately went back to sleep because I wanted to talk more. So i went back but time was stopped we were in my moms room and everything was in Black and White. I told him how I haven’t been doing well recently and asked him, “Why is this happening to me?” and he said “Your brain is just going through what it needs to go through”

207,Dreams,I keep dreaming about eating goldfish,"The first time was so vivid. Big blobs of abstract and squishy goldfish were willing themselves up out of my stomach. They tasted sweet and were gelatinous like candy. There were seven or eight of them. And it wasn't a short process. Each flopped out onto the table in front of me. A woman was attending to me and attempting to gather the jiggly, wriggly fish. 
There were sliding doors and a lot of wood... the table was low in some images, but in others it was high. The decor was traditional Japanese or Korean. Things changed in the dream so often that I really don't know which.
Someone was rubbing my back and another woman came over to me with a container of a small breed of/ baby goldfish. There were like a hundred in this container and I just started eating them. I don't know if I used my hands or some kind of utensil. But it was like I couldn't stop myself. I kind of realized what I was doing in the dream and tried to spit them out but I just kept shoveling them in... Raw, live goldfish. They did not taste sweet. A woman reassured me that I was ""doing good"" and stroked my free hand.

The next time (days later), I was having a normal dream and then suddenly I found a container of baby goldfish in my hands again. We were watching TV and some woman that seemed familiar but NOT a person I know in real life was telling me to try them. They said I might like them. I looked down and I had already eaten half of it with chopsticks. This time they were fried whole and the woman smiled and said, ""It wasn't so bad this time?""

I just popped up from another goldfish dream... **** is going on? No lady this time, just dinner with, again, familiar people that I don't know. I'm eating a dish and just so happen to look down and goldfish are stir fried into the rice-- looking at me‼️ It's like someone is trying to get me to eat them. 

Idk what's going on, but it's been a week and a half of this fluckery. I have an interpretation, but if anyone else wants to take a swing at it, you're welcome to.",2023-02-03 19:31:32,2014,True
208,Dreams,"I climbed a wrecked tower, witnessed horrors, and almost met God","I flared this as nightmare, as it has a very graphic scene involving a kind of child-zombie (best description I could make without spoiling, but I still wanted to give y'all a heads-up because it's a bit disturbing), but it's also very long.

\_\_

The light was dim, in the last minutes of a sunset. There was foliage everywhere, heavy and damp, giving an oppressive feeling even in the track I was walking on. In front of me, there was a crumbling tower, full of lose stones, that seemed to go on impossibly high in the sudden mist hanging around me, clinging to every detail of the scene. There was a bird singing ominously in the distance and I felt compelled to enter. 

The dampness was unbearable, I remember the smell of rot and decay sticking to my mouth and making it difficult to even breathe. The bottom floor of the tower was empty, with only a doorless opening to stairs that curled around themselves, and on the floor were cracked, large tiles, which depicted some ancient mosaic that was all shuffled, as if it were an ageless puzzle. I took the stairs and got on the first floor, where plants were everywhere. Suddenly I had a machete in my hand and I slashed at the thick branches, eventually found my way to the next stairs. 

Those were even more decrepit and I thought I would fall, but made it on the second floor. There was a child there, sitting on the wooden floor, looking at the wall on my right. He was so, so incredibly thin, with great big eyes who stared at nothing, wearing rags. I approached him and saw his distorted belly, the mediatic image of famine that I had seen on TV when I was a child and had stuck with me ever since. He turned his head towards me slowly, tilting it to the side, and tried to speak but nothing came out of his mouth where teeth were missing. I touched his shoulder, asking him to repeat, and his skin started to crumble under my fingers, rotting as in an accelerated video, and his flesh decayed into dust as I watch, horrified, maggots crawl out of his collapsed body. 

I screamed and yelled and cried because this was too much, and then a man appeared. He was the same man that had saved my life when I was a kid(\*). He looked at me with kindness and said, don't worry, go on, **** is upstairs. I blinked and he vanished. 

The stairs were right before me. I didn't look at the heap of gore and went on, trying to leave the nightmare behind me, and maybe meet ****. I took the stairs and it collapsed partially beneath me, and I stuck my foot in the hole, but I wrenched it free and tried to carry on. It then began to get smaller, slowly, every inch forward was closing the walls in on me. After a few steps, there was no way I could move normally, and I pushed a shoulder through the opening and tried my hardest to push through. There was sand everywhere, getting into my mouth, my ears, my eyes, and I felt as if I was buried alive. I closed my eyes and accepted that I would die right there trying to meet ****, and then I woke up breathing hard as if I'd just sprinted for a mile.

211,Dreams,My Dream made me cry,"I (M20) live with my partner (NB 19) of one year. We share an apartment with my friend (NB19)  from high school and we all get along. My high school friend knows about the dream and we are both concerned about what it could mean. To backtrack this is not the first dream that I have and I am starting to think that they are related. The first dream started with me hanging out with my s/o and my roommate in my room. We hear a knock at the front door and I answer. It's a man whose face I can't remember but he is tall and has a beard. He asks to see my s/o but I don't get a good vibe from him so I ask what about. He tries to shove past the door but somehow I slam it shut. I tell them to turn the lights off and hide because at this point he's banging on the door and yelling he is going to **** us. We escape to a jeep and hide again. (None of us have a car and only my roommate has a license) I'm in the driving seat when he sees us and breaks the window. I start the car and floor it. We somehow lose him and I see many horrific car accidents and know it was all because of him. The dream ends. That dream I had about 2 weeks ago. The dream I had last night I'm thinking is a **** up continuation.  The dream starts with a weird 2000s video/picture slideshow of fun times I've had with my s/o. Next thing I know I'm sitting on my couch looking mortified because I've been told that my partner has been kidnapped and possibly killed. We don't know by who and why. I call their mom and she already knows and we are both crying while on the phone. (She lives on the other side of the country so we've never met in person) the dream continues in a span of a month and I'm just crying every single day that they are gone and I'll never see them again. Someone showed me the **** pictures and I keep crying. One day I stop and try to keep working but someone tells me to keep hoping that they'll come back. That makes me cry again because we all know that they are dead. I woke up crying and see them lying next to me asleep. And was so glad the nightmare was over I hugged them so tight and fell back asleep.   I have no idea what it could mean. Help.

Update. (Still learning how all this works)

I had another dream. This time I was the one to be kidnapped. Never saw my captors and didn't hear anyone. I was alone in a cabin. I was tied and in my work uniform. Just sitting in darkness, beat up and unable to move. Shorter than the other two but I was really freaked out. My S/o still doesn't know I've been having dreams like this.

216,Dreams,I (24F) dreamt a dog with the face of a long haired woman attacked me,"It’s a dream I cannot get out of my mind. I have always been a vivid lucid dreamer since I was a kid, and now that I am pregnant I am having 2-4 dreams a night. Usually it’s just normal stuff, and aside from a few memorable ones from years before, none have made an impact on me like this. 

I dreamt I was fleeing my home from an unseen force, but somehow wound up on the floor of my parents room? Two people, a man and a young girl, that I didn’t recognize were with me. There was also a normal dog in the room barking to alert us of something. 

All of the sudden a large dog with the face of a long haired woman broke through the door, attacked and ate the other dog. I was unable to move from the floor during this, and the dog woman walked towards me smiling (she had a long, thin tongue) and pinned me down with her front paws before biting the left corner of my mouth. I felt legitimate pain.

Someone else then burst into the room and distracted the dog. I stood up, grabbed an electric fly swatted (think tennis racket with electric charge), turned it on, and held it to the woman’s head while she screamed. 

Then I woke up. Weirdest part of the dream was the fact that my face stung in the spot where I was bit for a minute or two until I convinced myself none of it was real.

I wasn't sure what to choose, and until I chose, she left. A little bit after that, I made the same choice as she had done, and that's were it ended.

I want to mention that I am currently unemployed, looking for a job in my domain. It's one of my worries, along with why she never texted me first (temporary separation?, having started on Christmas Eve - that's when we last spoke, and we haven't met physically since then nor have I gone to visit her so as not to become obnoxious or seem desperate) but once started, we could go for 2 hours at a time.",2023-02-03 17:23:02,945,True

I happened upon this subreddit while looking for a subreddit about Hopes and Dreams. 

However, the first thing I(21yo) thought of once I realized what this sub was for is a dream I've had periodically for as long as I can remember. The dream varies in location and time, and usually, I'm alone. I'm in a car, sometimes my car sometimes other cars, and I get into a minor car accident. Think like a fender bender, just bad enough that it has to be repaired. Sometimes I hit an inanimate object and sometimes I hit another car. The dreams are always terrifying, gut-wrenching crying, vomiting horror. 

IRL I'm not that concerned about actually getting into an accident like that, I've been in one before and it wasn't so bad. I'm curious about what you think of this dream, why would I be afraid of something in the dream that doesn't bother me IRL?",2023-02-03 16:35:44,866,True

225,Dreams,Could someone help me understand what this dream could mean?,"In my dream, we were trying to sneak out and run away from my brother in law's house which was like on some rocky island. My brother in law was joking and being nice, but we couldnt have him know we were running away. Beneath the ocean, there was this like lava being/monster that we would have to encounter. We (my husband and my kid) were nervous but it was the only option. We got dressed in scuba gear (because his house was on a rocky island) and went to run away.

Suddenly, I'm in a bright, white house and there are all these older women around. A woman who apparently knew me introduced me and said to the person I was being introduced to that if they were interested in buying a house, i was getting ready to start my real estate agency. I felt nervous because i hadn't officially decided yet whether or not I'd do this but she seemed to speak for me. We gathered in this house that was bright and white and obviously expensive and all the women there were very wealthy. We all held hands to pray. The hand that reached for mine to the left was the hand of an older black woman. She was the only non-white woman there. I felt comforted to hold her hand. We prayed and then the women began discussing things. I didnt hear what they said because I was thinking about what it would be like to have my own real estate agency. Then I woke up. 

For context: My brother in law and I have no problems aside from wishing he came around more often. I've never in my life considered real estate. In fact, I think it's not a great career choice in my city. I am a Christian so prayer is a standard practice in my life. I am white. Finally, I come from a lower socioeconomic class and we are currently in the very bottom of ""middle class"" (in relevancy to the expensive house and all the women around me being rich).

In the first part of the dream, I felt very very scared and anxious. In that second part, I felt out of place, uncomfortable, and nervous.

235,Dreams,reoccurring dream i’ve (21F) had for years of me being chased by a man?,"would like to get some help getting insight into what this dream might mean. for years now nearly Every Single dream i have follows the plot of me running away and hiding from whoever the antagonist man in my dream is. the location and person is always different but premise and feeling is the same—that i am in danger. 

i’ve had real life instances before where i’ve felt in danger by a man but most of the time it’s been irrational (i.e. this person probably wouldn’t actually follow through with causing me harm but i’m convinced they would and live in blinding fear for days/weeks). just want to hear some thoughts.

238,Dreams,trying to figure out what the hell my brain is doing &lt;3,"cool, so, to start off, i'm entirely new here and have 0 knowledge on dreams, dream interpretation, or anything in that direction. BUT i've been having similar dream experiences off and on for months now, and each time, they drain the life out of me and i'm left with no energy to even get up the next day.

the dreams have some things in common: they feel real, they're somewhat realistic in the sense that they do relate to topics/experiences that are relevant in my life, and are always scary, nightmare-vibe stuff that makes me wake up anxious. the topics in them, though, vary widely: one time i'm being chased by the police, having to get my friends to safety and constantly messing up in doing so; the other time, my mom gets traumatised in the same way as i did, doesn't deal with it and i end up getting triggered in my dream. last night, i dreamt that my brother started verbally abusing me and then beat me up over being trans. they're topics that come up in my life generally, stuff that i've dealt with, but the dreams pop up randomly and the themes in them don't relate to things that were very relevant the day/week/month before that.

the main thing these dreams all have in common, is that when i wake up from my alarm, i can't get up, and end up falling back asleep, back into the same dream. there's been a few times where i woke up in a dream several times before i actually woke up. from my experiences with sleep paralysis, it feels pretty different - there's no shadow people and i'm able to move enough to turn around and turn my alarm off, but i can't get to the point of getting up out of bed. my body simply won't allow me, somehow. after a few times of waking up, i want to - not wanting to go back to the same nightmare - but i can't/don't know how.

i guess i'm looking for anything - help, interpretation, recognition, similar experiences? anything 'cause at this point it's messing with my life lol",2023-02-03 12:37:59,1930,True

241,Dreams,Strange dreams,"So normally I don’t remember my dreams but I’ve had two weird dreams I remember quite vividly. I’ve been having dreams about being a different person. 

My first one was super strange and honestly when you read it you might laugh a little. So I don’t remember how I initially got there but I was running through an apartment where all the apartments were connected by doors. I had a short stature like that of a little person (dwarf) and had these huge metal encasings on my arms similar to a straight jacket. And I ran into the last apartment to get out of the building and there was lady holding a baby and I said sorry for coming through your apartment and she said “it’s okay, we all do it.” I heard everything she said but I was out of her apartment by the time she finished and the whole time I had been feeling immense panic like I was being chased. Then the dream ended by me waking up before I could figure everything.

The other one happened last night/today. When I woke up I couldn’t remember it but now I’m remembering it and it feels like a distant memory. Somehow I had met a man with my sister and mom (in the dream) and he offered to house us for the time being. We had a dog somehow and I had a baby. The man I came back from being out all day and I can’t really remember this part but something happened in the living room and then I went to speak with my sister. The man was in the bathroom at the time and we looked at each other and it’s like there was something dangerous with the man. And we both bolted out the apartment leaving behind our mom and dog but taking the baby. We didn’t have any of our belongings or anything.

It's also my home studio, and there are several devices that people may damage. My bed is in a very awkward position, but that's the only way I can fit a future 88 key keyboard.

246,Dreams,Reoccurring dream,"So a bit of a weird one, I’m 25 male and around once every 6 months for probably the last 6 or so years I have a dream about a girl I used to know. 
We went to school together we got on very well I had a crush on her for a bit when I was at school. We flirted quite a bit this occasionally led to kissing but nothing more thats also what happened the last time we met.
I haven’t seen her for 3 years and I don’t think about her for ages but then out of nowhere roughly every 6 months I have a really vivid dream and she’s in it, she’s never the centre of the dream but she’s there. 
I don’t know why but in these dreams I can recollect every detail of her face like a distinctive eye freckle. 
I hardly ever remember any details of dreams for more than about 5 min after I wake up.
But when she’s in a dream she’s then all I can think about for a few days. 
I also tend to get an overwhelming feeling of anxiety that I’ll never see her again that I never have about anything else. 
After a few days I forget all about it carry on then it happens all over again.  

I know this is unhealthy but can’t help it and I don’t understand it at all. 
Does any one have any insight on this?

248,Dreams,Eye bags and other things,"Once there was dream where I was falling, falling so fast everything around me was a blur. 
All that was passing through my stomach was that terrible dropping sensation that my body refused to free me from. 
Once I registered that I wasn’t waking up I started to notice castings of dark and light around me. 
They formed an image I’ll never forget no matter how hard I wished it away. 
As if the experience was real it was etched to my mind, past subconscious and back into the reality of my world. Left with a feeling there was no washing clean of. 
So there I was, so it seemed. 
Falling through perhaps colossal shafts almost like tall buildings or concrete pillars with no windows or arches. 
But as I saw them closely they weren’t buildings at all, more like dimensions of glittery dust I was streamlining between. 
I was falling with my back as stiff as a board looking up above. 
Once my eyes focused and locked into what it was presenting itself to me in the scape I was terrified. It was a scene from the pits of my deepest despair. 
I was scared, not just for my life but for the life of my soul after this. 
The life of my waking spirit. 
It was as if I was falling around body’s, hundreds of thousands of other people suspended in the air, falling through oblivion. Forever. Falling at such a speed none of us could move, falling so quickly it was as if we weren’t really falling at all. 
I still would not wake. 
Unable to work out how I got this image in my mind even in the dreamscape I grew frustrated. 
I’m trying to leave but I can not. 
Trying to turn my head, I desperately want to look down towards the doom I’m anticipating, the fall almost seems worse than the clap of death that could potentially be below. 
As I become more distressed something tears my focus back to what is above. 
My eyes are fixed and trance like. Somehow I can see myself and all that is happening around me. 
It jumped over my splayed body through the air. 
Up and up dancing through space and dodging the falling body’s. 
It looked twisted and scary, otherworldly. The higher I watched it climb the more beautiful the creature appeared to be. 
Its body seemed out of alignment to me at first until I realised it was carrying something. 
In the sirens arms it was carrying another, one of its kin. One that had fallen. Or perhaps injured. 
I still to this day can hardly do justice to the description of the creature, only the way it looked at me when it was feet above. 
Only the way I felt when it’s piercing eyes of glistening flames looked into mine with disgust. Deep into my soul, through me and on to the rest of the others falling down in to the pits. 
I wanted to die in that look, I knew I was below that creature. It was why I was falling. Everything made sense. It was carrying one of its own back up. It would leave me suspended. It would continue to hurry away from what ever tragedy it saw in my casings. 
I can still remember how I wished I was the creature in the arms of that thing. 
The one being carried up and up through the falling sky. 
My heart broke before I hit the ground, that was what woke me. Not the crash of the fall. 
What if I would never be held like that by my own kind.
What if my soul never felt ‘saved’. 
I wanted to go back to sleep to escape the feelings I had just discovered but at this time I was so terrified of my own mind that I could not find peace in rest.",2023-02-03 10:47:53,3403,True
249,Dreams,dreams of destruction,"I had this dream of going to my grandmother's (deceased) house. She was there, along with my great aunt (my parents are no longer in contact with her), my parents, and one of my closest friends.

My grandmother lived in a trailer, and we were all camped out in the living room waiting for a meteor shower.

It had started and we were all excited watching, until we realized they were super close to the earth. So close we could see every detail of them.

I studied the rest of the sky and suddenly noticed the moon. It was a blood moon.

We all backed a bit away from the window as the meteors seemed to fly even lower and one actually grazed my grandmother's house, taking out a tiny portion of roof on her covered porch.

We all went to bed, not wanting to be around the big window anymore, and when we woke up, it was over.

There was no more damage to my grandmother's trailer, and we stepped outside. My grandmother's property was a huge farm like place, and my aunts 3 bedroom brick house was across the yard.

My grandmother's side of the property was untouched accept for the tiny spot in her covered porch.

Everything else was destroyed. There was nothing left of my aunts house except the outline of where the house had been. 

There was debris and destroyed plants all on my aunts side, but my grandmother's side was clean and her Garden was perfect.

I was standing in the checkout line, and we were telling jokes together and laughing just like old times. ""The Boys Are Back In Town"" by Thin Lizzy was playing on the speaker, and it was amazing. Then, my 8th grade teacher was the one working the checkout, and so I talked to her as well. All around, a pretty great dream, but I'm curious as to what it could mean.",2023-02-03 10:28:25,776,True
251,Dreams,Terrifying Owls and a strange coincidence,"So here’s a weird thing.

I had a dream the other night. Really messed up one. Nothing like anything I’ve ever had before…

All these birds were swimming underwater in a transparent barrel of water. I had two thin metal spikes. An owl swam upwards in the barrel and I speared it with both, and then started pulling it apart. But it just kept swimming up, and ignored the spikes, forcing its way out of the water and towards my face! Scared the **** out of me and I woke up. Wrote it down right away.

Today we visited the Picasso museum in Malaga, Spain.

Went in one room. Loads of paintings and sculptures of owls! Weirded out.

Now prior to this, really hadn’t seen much of Picasso’s works except for his classic masterpieces. No owls.

And that dream was insane and SO intense and out of character for me… any thoughts as to anything it might mean? I’m writing off the Picasso thing as mere coincidence but thought it was interesting enough to share anyway!",2023-02-03 10:06:48,961,True

It doesn't particularly hurt, but I feel the sensation of them being ripped out. Each time is usually a little different, different tooth or teeth, or the specific way they get ripped out, etc.

This has been going on, I'd say a year or two, not entirely sure. Has anyone ever experienced anything similar? 

I'll add that I'm somewhat conscious of my teeth and am fairly scared of having teeth pulled out. Once, when I was a kid, my dad had to pull the remaining half of an old rotted tooth out with pliers, so it could be related to that ""trauma"".",2023-02-03 09:42:44,860,True

I was standing in the middle of the ruins, next to my step-dad, and we were both ghosts or phantoms basically, and the remaining fires were purple, so it seemed we were in some kind of phantom realm, and he said something along the lines of ""What happened? It was just a small fire?"". 

Then in my dream, I woke up in bed in the same house, crying and screaming, because it had felt so real, I think I ran to my parents crying and told them what happened. Then at some point, everything was black. I could not move, and I'm not sure if I even had a body to move. I believe I was in the void. A voice said to me, ""Time is beyond death"", menacingly.

I’m curious as to if I could see them again, would I be led to the same experience or if I would venture upward to unknown dangers within the velvety red. The stairs would never actually be the main existence of the dream either, it would just be setting patiently waiting as if it knew me, beckoning and expelling my presence.

DREAM

A third dream I had recently. I was staying in Japan for some reason. Not a tourist but actually staying with a family in a sort of remote village. It was like a semi small town with a downtown type area that wasn't very big. Maybe three or four businesses. It was a beautiful mountain type town. I had a crush on this woman around my age. Okay, but the best part of the dream was when we went to this park that had this huge pond. The pond looked partially man made, but it had water flowing through and this metal grate at the bottom corner. the water was crystal clear and there were these pennies people threw down to the bottom. Like a wishing well. We were having a picnic basically, with the pond around 20 feet below. Maybe a bit shorter. You could jump if it wasn't so shallow.

I guess you could swim in the pool, because one of the kids of the family went down there to swim. I saw him jump into the water. i was talking to everyone and enjoying myself, when I got freaked out suddenly and asked ""have you seen \[random name\] come back out of the water? They said no. We all got freaked out and called everyone at the park to search the water. The area around the metal grate was very dark and deep. I said ""get a flashlight! Get a flashlight!"" I ran up the steep grass pathways up the hill. When I got the flashlight and ran back down. I saw one of the Japanese men holding the boy with a big grin on his face. No one was mad at the boy, they were so glad he was just hiding in the grass. He was very young, basically a toddler. They were also not mad at me.",2023-02-03 09:26:34,2267,True
258,Dreams,Hi everyone. First time I’ve had dreams in a bit. I wanted to know if anyone knows or possibly could understand anything this means.,"So what happened in this dream is myself a man who i never saw his face and i believe my younger sister fought and slayed a devil at his house. It was actually quite scary throughout it and for a little bit I thought the man would die however he prevailed. This fight had magic in it it’s almost like you could hear the sound of it odd buzzing sounds and such from magical items.  But when he died there were stones under the porch which is the place we were fighting on.(A porch on the front of the house). These magic stones lit up under the porch that the fight was on after the devil or evil being was slain. I believe it was a devil. I remember for whatever reason a room in the back of the devils house there were two kids were upstairs one was doing something I can’t remember and the other had bags sorted out on the floor which were also glowing which i believe relate to the stones. From this I believe that would mean the devil infact didn’t truly die. 
I’m having a hard time wrapping my head around this and am not sure if this has some meaning into my life or not. I must add with the devil I am not religious so it doesn’t have to do anything with that realm. Thank you guys and let me know what you think!",2023-02-03 09:22:41,1221,True

Next I wake up and go back to sleep. I’m now watching my family from the outside including myself sitting at a table. I’m confused about what’s going on but I can’t move because my mom and aunt are yelling at me to stay in the corner of the room. They won’t let me move nor will they explain anything.

271,Dreams,Sci-Fi Prison," I don't like being scared by Horror, but I find their concepts interesting, so I'll watch [""How to Beat""](https://www.youtube.com/@HowToBeatYT/videos) and [""Movie recaps""](https://www.youtube.com/@movierecapsofficial) on YouTube.

So in my nightmare, I dreamt I was watching a movie recap about a made-up movie. It's set in a post-apocalyptic world, not too far from our own time. Modern society could no longer sustain itself, so cities were mostly left abandoned. Basic technology like cars became a rarity amongst the public. Most people had to go to the countryside to begin farming, in order to feed themselves.

There is a government and people seem to fear it like it's omnipresent. It has ridiculously strict regulations and civilians are constantly second-guessing themselves. To not become an outlaw, even by accident, the farmers have solely focus on work and never get ****/gamble in their off time. It is like a modern version of Oliver Cromwell's England. Biker Gangs and scavengers ran wild - While the powerful government quickly sweeps them up, they have nothing to lose and have fun while they can.

There was one big example in my dream of the Government's power. Due to the biker's gangs, it's illegal to use a main road for an extended period of time. Giant hovercraft monitor the roads and if it records you using it for too long - It'll begin the warning stage. It'll tail your vehicle and begin to fire giant hook shots at the side of the road. This will go on for serval minutes and if you don't turn off the main road during that time - It'll go for lethal force. The first hook shot will tear off the roof of your car and then a second will skewer you. That why's the gangs use bikes, as they have easier times dodging the hooks.

If an outlaw is captured alive by the government - The worst prison they can be sent to, is one on a space station. It doesn't matter if you're a killer or shoplifter, anyone can be sent here. Even if it's a prison, it's basically a death sentence. The aim of the prison is to drive its inmates insane until they off themselves or are killed by someone else. They do this as an example to civilians, to make them terrified of committing crimes and making them unsympathetic towards these ""beastly prisoners"".

There are multiple ways they torment the inmates. The walls are stark white and the floodlights never get turned off. It's impossible to know it's day or night. Inmates are forced to wear those plastic masks, that almost resemble shopping bags. The mask circulates your own breath into your ears, so it sounds like a constant wind in your head. Breathing also feels stale and difficult.

The living areas for the prisoners use the same see-through plastic as their masks. Every inmate sleeps in the same giant tower, where hammocks are stung up at different levels. It looks like a spider's web. The hammocks have no pillows or blankets. Their strings are so long, they dip and sway with the slightest movement. You feel like you can fall to your death at any moment. Getting a wink of sleep is incredibly difficult.

Outside of sleeping hours, the inmates are made to hang out in a mile-long room, with that same plastic as the entire floor. Do you remember those [rainbow parachutes you played with as children](https://www.google.com/search?q=parachute+play&amp;tbm=isch&amp;ved=2ahUKEwij4Jqi6vf8AhUhVqQEHTL8BpsQ2-cCegQIABAA#imgrc=0AJSgHSLG__s9M)? You could put yourself or balls in the middle and stumble as you tried to get out. Imagine a huge version of that and you were never allowed to leave. The inmates have to carefully scatter their weight around, or the entire floor won't dip, causing everyone to pile at the centre. Inmates have to spend all day balancing on this slippery clear plastic, with a sheer drop below them. The floor will never break, but it's designed to always tease it could. When it comes to meals, guards will just roll food into the plastic pit and inmates have to do a mad scramble to catch them, often rioting. For solitary confinement, an inmate will be placed in a plastic sphere, that rolls with the slightly steps, making it impossible to even stand up. The inmate has to lie there, feeling motion sick for the whole day.

The dream ended with me, putting my laptop down and thinking that was a really creepy movie. Then I woke up and I had to figure out that movie recap video never actually existed.

273,Dreams,Bloody weird dream last night - war in a shopping centre,"I had a really bizarre dream last night. I was in a shopping centre with some friends and all of a sudden a war broke out. From there I could only assume I was on the 'good' side, and trying to avoid being killed by the bads.

This shopping centre was getting shot up to ****, but I was avoiding getting hurt, and seemingly not doing any fighting or shooting myself, just trying to stay alive. At one point I saw a harrier jump jet doing some manoeuvres above the building. People from different parts of my life (including people off the TV) were popping up in this throughout, that had no connection to each other.

Me and a small group were cornered by some bads, we didn't get killed, but the bads were selecting some of us to go with them (presumably the rest were released) - it looked like I was going to be released but then the leader of these bads (who was NoHo Hank from Barry) allowed a child in their group to select one of us to go with them, this kid walked back and picked me, and I assumed that was because my beard made me stand out from the crowd... From that point on I was a reluctant bad guy.

I went to the toilet in the bad guys' lair, which was in darkness, and flushed the toilet, which for some reason wasn't allowed. During this, I somehow acquired a revolver and some ammo.

The good guys came into the lair, the leader of whom was someone from my work past, she was giving me some **** about changing sides (which I had no say in). I wanted to use the gun to **** the leader of the bads, but the gun only had two bullets in and they were blanks (I think).

Then... Dara O'Briain (Irish comedian) came in to shoot me, but before he did, I had to take a turn on [this game](http://shorturl.at/bwLU5).

Then I woke up before being shot, and I have no idea what happened next.

274,Dreams,Had a dream where I knew a dog genetic code but can’t recall this information in real life even though I’m trying to learn it. How?,"I started mirtazapine on the 18th to attempt to increase my appetite (long story I won’t go into depth but for the past 5-6 months I haven’t been eating much at all and the mirtazapine has helped to some extent as well as giving me some unwanted side effects that I’m trying to ride out). I did read this morning that it can cause vivid dreams. Since starting I’m having several negative vivid dream a night every night, no other medication has changed. 

Anyway, I’ve been trying to learn dog coat/colour genetics as it interests me and no matter how much or how little I read I cannot (or so I thought) retain this information. I even had my dog tested to give me something to work towards and still nothing stuck in my head. 

Last night in one of the dreams someone asked me the genetics behind my dog (it wasn’t my actual dog, just some Heinz 57 black dog, my current dog is a brown Border Collie) and I said “he is KB/KB which means black”, I woke up thinking to myself “I’m sure that’s actually tri markings” I wasn’t 100% sure it was tri but I was almost certain it was not black, so I googled and to my disbelief it was black!

It could be completely coincidental, but out of all the genetic codes and colours to me it’s very small odds, maybe nearly impossible. 

Could it be that my brain is actually retaining the information but for whatever reason I can’t recall it? I’ve got various health conditions and I suffer from extreme fatigue and brain fog which I’ve always blamed for my poor memory and get angry at it a lot. I’m both amazed and confused at the same time over how I got it right in my dream.

276,Dreams,"I've been having these HORRIFICALLY disturbing recurring dreams where I suddenly remember that I killed someone 10-15 years ago, hid/disposed of the body and am about to get caught.","Ok, so I made this account purely for the purpose of posting my experience with this dream because I desperately feel the need to get this out and hopefully get some insight from other users.  This is going to be a long one and I'm going to include the most detail I can possibly remember, so buckle up.  


I want to start off by saying it would be impossible for me to fully convey how this dream felt emotionally.  It was one of the worst things I've ever experienced... I'm talking genuinely traumatizing.  The best way I can describe it is a horrific combination of pure terror, revulsion, paranoia, fear, and darkness that somehow came together to create a new/distinct emotion that has no name.  Something beyond description.  The word ""ghoulish"" comes to mind for some reason.  

It was a specific variation of a recurring dream I've been having for years.  Details like the time, place, and the people involved are always different in each variation of the dream; but certain key elements are always the same.  The dream never involves the killing itself.  It's always a case where I suddenly remember having participated in killing someone (either deliberately or on accident) a very long time ago (usually in my early to mid teens) and disposing of their body in some way.  It's always as if I had completely forgotten about the act for many years, but something happens that suddenly makes me remember, and the memory always feels SO real.  The remembrance always coincides with this overwhelming fear that I'm about to be caught.  Like the body is about to be discovered along with forensic evidence linking me to the scene.  


As I said, I've been having variations of this dream for years.  The dream is always disturbing, but nothing like what I recently experienced.  This particular variation involved two of my close childhood friends from real life.  I was the same age in my dream that I am in real life, but I suddenly recall a memory from when I was 13-14.  It was during the summer and I was hanging out with my two friends along with a third kid (who was a fictional person that doesn't exist in real life).  Despite not being a person from real life, I somehow knew exactly who he was (including his first and last name, which I forgot upon waking up) and all these details about his life as if he was a real person.  I even had memories of him from when we were younger kids.  He was a year or so younger than us and sort of a loser who desperately wanted to be cool and hang out with us, which we reluctantly agreed to.  My other friend was constantly being a **** to him, making fun of him, slapping him around, and playing mean spirited practical jokes on him.  Again... all of this was a MEMORY of the past that existed within the dream, not something that actually happened within the dream.  I suddenly recall a memory of my **** friend playing a practical prank on the kid (the details of which I don't remember) that somehow result in the kid ending up dead.  The incident took place in a fictional outdoor setting on top of a deforested hill deep in the woods.  There was an old well that people would throw all sorts of trash down.  Kids would drink out there are throw empty beer cans down the well along with all sort of other things.  The interior of the well was sort of shaped like a ""J"".  It curved towards the bottom and went off to the side.  I remember we threw the body down the well and attempted to cover it up with all the trash down there.  We later got **** up there and threw all the bottles down the well to help cover it up even more.  We would continue hanging out there (as we always did) and never spoke about the incident again.  Nobody ever questioned us about the kid.  


Over 15 years went by.  We went through high school, some of us went off to college, etc.  All of our lives had simply moved on like nothing ever happened.  I had forgotten about the incident completely, as if I had subconsciously buried it away deep in my mind.  One day (for no apparent reason) I suddenly remember it.  My mind starts to become flooded with so many emotions.  The guilt, the extreme fear of getting caught or somebody finding the body, etc.  I started to play out scenarios in my mind... like the police finding our fingerprints on the beer bottles in the well.  The fear of getting caught became overwhelming.  At the same time, part of me was questioning whether it actually happened.  It was really strange.  I had no memory of hearing about any police investigation into the matter, nor did I remember anyone even talking about the kid being missing.  I did a Google search on the kid's name (which I KNOW included a normal first and last name, but i can't remember what it was) and found a small online news article published a few years after the incident (but was 10+ years old by the time I found it) about the kid disappearing and how nobody knew what happened to him.  The article even had a picture of him.  I felt this horrible guilt while reading it, which then quickly added to my fears of being caught because it was the first time I encountered public information acknowledging the incident in some way.  The next thing I remember I was at a gathering of all our old high school friends, including one of the two friends who I was with when ""it"" happened.  I remember I hadn't seen him in years.  When I went to talk to him one of the first things he said was ""do you remember (kid's name)?"" and I felt this sense of enormous dread wash over me.  It destroyed any hope I had left of it being a false memory.  I was suddenly faced with the reality that it actually happened and that we really did it.  I can't even begin to describe how terrifying that was.

&amp;#x200B;

Something compelled me to return to the well where we had hid the kid's body all those years ago.  When I got there, I saw about a dozen people in hazmat suits all over the place.  There were parked trucks, digging equipment, and all these huge lights like the ones used to illuminate football fields during night games.  I saw a guy who looked like a police officer standing on top of a raised platform looking down into the well.  I saw him raise his arm and point his finger at something in the well.  I knew they just discovered the body.  

&amp;#x200B;

The next thing I knew I woke up... I spent the next minute or so in pure panic mode questioning whether I really did commit this act all those years ago.  It took me a while to come to the realization that none of the events in the dream actually happened.  It was just horrible... I don't know if anyone else has ever experienced something like this, but I would really appreciate some input.  The whole thing has really shaken me to the core.  I had no idea it was even possible for a dream to have this level of impact on someone psychologically.",2023-02-03 05:46:36,6851,True

The dream will start with me somewhere, anywhere really. I might personally recognise the place or I might not. I might be with people I recognise, random people who I apparently know in these dreams or by myself. I could be somewhere nice or somewhere that holds a lot of emotional turmoil or trauma for me. Wherever I am and whoever I am with I don't want to be there, I message or call my fiancee and tell her I just want to come home, I don't want to be where I am anymore, asking if I can come home now and I'm completely distraught. Sometimes the people around me won't notice I'm upset or will try to guilt trip me into staying. At some point during the wanting to go home I'll wake up in the dream at home in my bed at night with my fiancee asleep next to me and a wave of relief washes over me and I can breathe again. I realise I was dreaming the whole wanting to come home and that I am home and everything is ok. Then I actually wake up in real life and I'm just there like ""brain what is you doing?""

Even though they are detailed dreams I often can't 'decipher' them in time to alter or prevent things from playing out. Confused? Same!

Example Dream:
I'm walking into what looks like my local highschool/hospital/event center all in one.
I'm fkn nervous but I know I have to go inside because of something!?? A meeting? Turning in late homework 😱(I finished school in '10 btw). I'm anxious the entire time walking fast trying to find where I'm supposed to go.
""Students"" start to look at me weird and so does the ""staff"" I'm making myself stand out! at this point I'm very lost/confused and fkn sweaty running around in a building that is familiar but not quite the same...eek!

Wake up.

Later that week...
My middle school child has a class party and their father was supposed to go but cancelled. ****! I guess I'm going then!

Well I went and it was fine for the first 10min, I should've left after that, my child was having fun with friends and not interested in doing the activities/crafts together, that was fine with me because I'm nervous I'm crowds...
I should have fkn left! I ended up lost in the high school looking for past teachers to chat with. The school had changed drastically! Everything was new and huge! Security guards mistaken me once for a middle schooler and tried to chase me back, another guard kinda followed me around (he seen that I was lost! He could've helped me! I shouldn't have been so shy and scared to ask for help!) Anyway I was starting to panic (starting to sweat) thinking I'd be sent to detention or sent home on a bus leaving my car in the parking lot. Nobody believes my age (30 going on 15 apparently!) They seriously think I'm a student, teenagers are super scary and super tall y'all 😭😭
I did manage to visit and catch up with my favorite teachers that day after making myself look like a fkn **** 😭😬

My dream tried to warn me to be cool but I didn't realize my dream ""predictions"" were comt true until it was too late 😅

Also I probably wouldn't have been so sweaty if I didn't panic run AND if just I took my **** hoodie off.... BUT I WAS WEARING A NARUTO SHIRT AND EVERY MIDDLE SCHOOL KID WAS ALSO WEARING AN ANIME SHIRT SO I CAN SEE WHY I WAS MISTAKEN FOR ONE THE FIRST TIME 😀

Those dreams kept coming to me until one night I dreamt I was stubbed in the leg. In the morning after waking up I found a message from a guy I met online years ago and stopped communicating with him for years, telling me he is injured in his leg. 

I didn't pay attention to the coincidence, but when he reconnected with me and started telling me about his life, he told me about those health problems, failing the last year of college, etc. That's too much coincidence.

I stopped contacting him and asked him to never contact me again. I can't take those dreams anymore and I thought that by cutting him off I would stop dreaming of that weird dream.

Yet, last night I had another dream I saw myself inside his body again, struggling with problems with teeth and financial problems.

I didn't fall in love with him, I didn't think about him, during the no contact years I didn't follow him on social media and never felt interested in his stories. Why does he haunt me? I want this to end.

287,Dreams,I had a vivid dream that I was cheating with one of my wife's friends. I am not attracted to this friend. Weird dream.,"We were in a bed in their second house. They don't have a second house. We were actively sexing each other. She's not at all attracted to me, I'm not at all attracted to her. I'm not being repressed about it, either - there are plenty of her friends that I freely admit that I'm attracted to, not that I would ever do anything about it.

I'm not a cheater, my wife's friend is not a cheater, and it's all so unlikely. Dreaming brain does what dreaming brain does, the weird electric meatball.

The sexing was vivid, graphic, detailed. Texture and smell and feel, every sense seemed to be engaged. Again, very strange. I can not imagine why this dream, with this person. It would almost make sense if it were a stranger, or one of any number of my wife's other friends, but it wasn't. 

Anyhow, we totally got busted mid-act by her husband, who was wearing a silly blue tuxedo *ala* Django Unchained. He was supposed to be out of town, at their first house. He walked in and had a serious, disappointed talk with us, and I felt crushed to have hurt his feelings. Then I thought about my wife, and my soul hurt.

And then I woke up, and I was with my wife in Disneyland at Hawaii. There is no Disneyland in Hawaii, of course, so I was still dreaming, but in the logic of dreams, I didn't notice. I was only relieved that the weird affair had been a bad dream.

I knew the Hawaii Disneyland quite well, having been there several times. I wanted to show my wife an ice cream parlor on the second level above the boardwalk, so we carried our bikes up the stairs and around the old bar that I used to go to all the time, but the ice cream shop wasn't there, had never been there, and we laughed about this.

Then, my wife wanted a new pair of sunglasses, so we went in to the church that was where the ice cream shop was supposed to be, and shopped for sunglasses there, but my wife wanted to buy the wrong pair, and it was important to me that she buy the right ones, so we talked about it at length, weighing the pros and cons. 

I'm not sure what happened after that. 

I think I've woken up for real this time, though time will tell. I just felt like sharing it with someone.

so the dream start like ad

where the employees had to participate and one of them didn't like that, so at night he made a ranting video where he was walking alone at night on a dirt road with field to his left and trees to his right

he was basically complaining about his job and America, I don't remember everything he said even when I was in the dream, but one thing I clearly remember was him saying 

""the problem with America is that if you're too **** to drive home at night, you can always use a light attachment on your assault rifle"" he demonstrated by showing an assault rifle with a mini floodlight 

lighting up the dirt path  and that's about where it stopped

296,Dreams,I dreamt that I was away and my Mom liked herself,"( this is a nightmare that includes suicide 
I can’t change the title but it was supposed to be “I dreamt that I ran away and my mom mom killed herself” )

So I always look up my dreams, but this were a very specific one

So I live I Denmark, more specific Jutland, but I used to live in Copenhagen, those are SO different, it’s like different states in America,both their accent and “culture” and I get pretty much bullied bc I’m not from there and wants to go back to Copenhagen after 2 years ( this is not apart of the dream, but I think it may be a good detail to remember when hearing the dream ) 

I had also moved to Jutland 2 years ago there, like nothing in the dream were different from here, until it “started”

The dream: So I was talking with my Mom, about coming home or going somewhere idk, I was talking normally and so was she, but I was actually really sad, and after she hung I just stopped smiling, and decided to secretly buy a train ticket all the way to Copenhagen which took 4 hours and when I get there it was weird ( I also realised after the dream that all the places I was are places I’ve seen in past dreams but never reality ) I had nowhere to go, but I found 4 other people my age, maybe supposed to be 1-2 year older than me, nobody knew each other, but no one had a place to go and we all ran away so we decided to stay together, so we just hang out ( again at places Ive seen in my dreams before ) but when it bad became dark, I talked with the other’s s and noticed my mom calling me, I told to wait, and that I was gonna act sad, when I took the phone I started being like “mom I’m so sorry I wanna go home plz help me” we talked, but as we talked more I started feeling really guilty and sad, and it wasn’t fake tears anymore, and when she found out I was all the way in Copenhagen, I think she said one sentence, and stopped the call quicker than ever, I tried to call her back on both messenger and normal phone, but I seemed to be blocked, and then I just realised that she were gonna **** herself bc she was tired of me always doing **** stuff, and bc she was tired about trying so much to help when I keep doing **** stuff. So I started calling my grandma since we lived really close ( also in reality) se didn’t take it, and then something happened in my stomach, indicating that it was too late.

So that was the dream, again, most not all places where places in past dreams, but that’s actually pretty normal for me, there was only some few new places, sitting in a bus on the way to my old house, my old house ( which was also so redesigned I couldn’t recognise it, and when I finally it a hold of which house it was I was in denial bc it was so different )
And the place where I called my mom and told her I ran away and where I was when she killed herself

Me and my mom doesn’t have a bad relationship, and we’ve never had, quite opposite, I’m going through hard times and she’s helping me so much, she have better hopes in me than I do myself. I also have a young little brother, and we have no dad, it’s just us 3 ( and my grandma not living far away like I’m the dream ) so idk what this dream means",2023-02-03 00:08:35,3151,True
298,Dreams,Why do I repeatedly dream of seeing or very recently being a Wendigo?,"Exactly as the title says I've had many dreams over the past two years where I see a Wendigo just appear out of nowhere &amp; stare at me then leave. 

He's always the modern interpretation of a Wendigo with some quirks unique to him. A Skyrim-esque werewolf body with black fur except for both arms which are furless with white-peach skin like mine (Caucasian) a wolf skull for a head with antlers that simultaneously resemble a deer and a moose, both eyes are an empty black abyss, and he stands from 8 to 10 feet tall. 

I never feel any fear when I see him nor do I get the feeling I should. His presence stops everything in my dream besides me and him. He always shows up in a forest. But not everytime I'm in a forest. Just that when he does show up it's in the forest.

Sometimes he'll show up in nightmares where I'm being chased by something that wants to harm me and the moment he shows up everything stops. The dream monsters, the wind, even time itself. Everything stops besides me and him. Then we just observe each other for like 30 seconds, it's always very brief and always very profound and I always go fully lucid when it happens. After that he simply disappears and the dream is over.

Until yesterday when I dreamed I was him.

 I was in a forest and I immediately understood who and what I was. I went in search of people and found 3 that were just walking around. I'm not gonna go into details on what I did to them but we all know what wendigos do to people and that's exactly what happened. In short I ate them all alive.

Once that was done I just walked around the forest. It was actually quite peaceful, I could bend the forest to my will. Reshape the environment and control the weather. After a bit of this I woke up. I'm not scared or afraid it was actually kind of fun. Just curious on why I keep having these dreams and why it suddenly changed yesterday. Thoughts?",2023-02-03 00:04:22,1896,True

300,Dreams,crazy dream i had 2 years ago,"2 years ago sometime in october i fell asleep and woke up in my bed (i was still dreaming) i didnt know i was still dreaming so i got up washed and was about to go downstairs but some reason i started floating as if gravity weakened  


 i was terrified because it felt so real and i jumped out of bed (this time i was awake) it was around 1 am at the time i woke up i realized i was dreaming so i went back to sleep just for the same thing to happen  


 and i almost started crying because it was that scary this time it was around 1:30 so i started praying cause i thought i did something i shouldnt have and i fell asleep for a 3rd time  


 woke up in the dream and still didnt know i was in a dream until i went downstairs and started floating again this time i got mad (i didnt know why at the time) and decided to try going about my day floating but as i got down to the last few steps i dropped to the ground and got hurt it wasnt painful though  


 so i got up and was about to take my bike and go somewhere i didnt know where at the time but i was just going to bike around (i dont remember me biking anywhere i just remember leaving the house on my bike) i ended up inside a mall with my bike gone (probably outside the mall)  


so i walk around in this mall for a few minutes nothing out of the ordinary but i look to my right and see a kid run out of a store and say ""follow me (my name)"" and i was confused so i followed her she was in a full sprint and since i was dreaming i felt like i was running on air i was still running but i wasnt nearly as fast as i can run irl she ran into a food court and i lost her and then i woke up  


i was so confused after that it was around 3 am when i woke up and i sat in my bed thinking about that dream i got up to use the bathroom and got on my computer as i did not want to dream that dream again  


 fast forward 1 year or 2022 in late october i went to bed around 1 am and fell asleep almost immediately as i did alot that day and i was tired so i start dreaming  woke up in my dream and got out of bed washed got dressed and went to go downstairs but i felt a weird feeling kinda like pressure (i dont think thats the right word but its the closest to what i felt) on my whole body as if i weighed 50 pounds heavier i dont know why but at the time i just dismissed it and took a step downstairs then i started floating and it felt familiar but i didnt stop to think why but some reason i was able to see a HUD as i looked around  


i saw a timer to my left saying floatation and it was doing down by the second 10,9,8 and so on until it hit 1 i was shocked and didnt know what to do i thought i was gonna explode or something when it hit 0 but once it hit 0 i fell down the stairs (i was still floating at the top of the stairs) and i got hurt badly but it didnt feel like anything  


so i looked like i got beat up and then when i wasnt paying attention the HUD thing went away and i chalked it up to me just falling (i didnt think much of the floating once i hit the ground) but then i went to my bike didnt know where i was going to go and ended up in the same exact spot in the mall bike gone and the same kid ran out of the store and said ""you were too slow catch up this time"" i instantly realized i was dreaming again but it felt real again so i tried to wake myself up but failed so i started running to follow the kid and i lost her again in the food court but this time i walked around and saw a big square cutout of the wall that the kid ran through and because that cutout had construction tape and stuff around it i didnt think about following her  


and now that i think about it i dont remember seeing a square cutout in the wall the first time i had the dream  


so i go sit down at a table and think what do i do when a group of people sit around the table i didnt know these people but they talked to me like i was a close relative so we were talking and eating food and had a good time til i realized i was still dreaming so i purposely fell and hit my head on a table to my left   


i woke up and the sun was still down i didnt think to check the time as i just wanted to get out of that dream and thats basically it now it may be a coincidence i had a dream i could walk around in 1 year apart from eachother but i dont think its a coincidence that i had the same exact dream with some small changes a year apart in the same month of eachother can someone explain???",2023-02-02 23:32:21,4457,True
301,Dreams,"Wednesday Dream at an AirBnB with family, ft. Toy Story, old coins, PS1 games, and more","The dream, from what I recall, started with my youngest sisters, my dad, and me walking down a road similar to the one that leads to our IRL house, with weather looking overcast as it looks IRL ATM. But the road in this dream was a dirt path, as opposed to the paved street we live on. This was the first indicator for me this was somewhere new.

At some moment while walking, I stopped to kneel and look at something shiny in the now slightly muddy ground. Wiping the filth off of the object, I could discern it was a 1956 or 1964 silver dime. This wasn't the first time I've seen this same dime. It also appeared in my black hole sun dream, too. For these reasons, I keep my IRL 1964 silver dime beside my bed.

&amp;#x200B;

Soon after this, we eventually made it to our destination. It looked nothing like our house, and by some dream-knowledge, I knew it was a place we were staying at only temporarily. On the oldschool projection-type HDTV, we watched something Toy Story-related, as it had Sid's sister in it, finding out the toys are alive.

Sometime after that, my dad came back inside, apparently back from metal detecting with one of my siblings whom I knew wasn't inside at that point. He poured their findings on the clothed table in the dining room, looking to see all of what there was. I was looking to see one, and it appeared to look like a brown metal disc covered in mercury.

Seeing it more intently, I wiped it a bit, seeing if the lighter metal was some coating that could come off of it. And it did. It slipped off soon enough and pooled together below the table. The coin that was unveiled showed itself to be some kind of exonumia, with *The Los Angeles Times* written on the reverse, and a denomination of $2 below that. Material-wise, it seemed to be made of a brass alloy of some kind, as some non-money tokens tend to be. No clue if a token like described above exists IRL or not, nor what reason it'd have to.

&amp;#x200B;

After that, I went to play some PS1 on the TV. The game looked to be a bit of a mixture of Gran Turismo and Demolition Racer. The track I was racing on I remember seeing in a demo for one of the GT games, but the mechanics of the racing worked the same as DR, as opponent racers could be damaged throughout the race. This was an interesting mix of elements for a game, and it proved to be quite entertaining for me.

Sometime once I finished that, I left and sat in a chair or lied in a bed, reading a comic magazine of some kind. All I can recall from the mag was there being *Futurama* and *Scott Pilgrim* comic strips in it. Dunno if this was anything that's ever happened either, but it was something interesting to ponder after the dream.

&amp;#x200B;

&amp;#x200B;

And that's where my memory of it ends. Quite the mundane, but intriguing sort of dream. Like living a day in the life of myself, but in a parallel dimension, somewhere out there in the vast multiverse. Hope anyone reading this can get this reposted to other subs that'd find this a fun read, I'd love if anyone out there can find if any of those things from my dream exist IRL!! :D",2023-02-02 23:21:10,3111,True
302,Dreams,Pretty Vivid War Nightmare,"I had a dream last night I was working in a hospital as a dietary aide (nothing similar to my actual job) and I was helping patients with things not dietary related. When all of a sudden I was taken to the top floor that had a huge window overlooking the city, imagine a super tall building in Brooklyn looking over at Manhattan. It was then I noticed the city was in shambles. The buildings were blown up and there was a full on war occurring. The news went on and they said they were barricading the city center so no one could get in our out. 

I started freaking because I didn’t know where my husband and son were. I called my husband and he said he was near the city center and was not phased at all. He was heading over the bridge to get off the island and noticed it blocked. I was talking while watching the news and it was showing young people blocking doors trying to keep the people attacking out but they were sacrificing people to do so and it was so sad. Building were toppling and explosions were everywhere. 

In that moment I could watch my husband grab our son out from his car seat and start running over the bridge trying to escape and as he made it to the other side he was shot in the back and fell ontop of our son. 

I flashed back to the hospital and the nurses around me said I was being recruited to be a nurse instead of dietary and then I woke up…  thankfully it was 7:15am so I didn’t have to return to my dream! 

It was a pretty awful dream for many reasons. But boy these pregnancy dreams are taking a toll on me 🫠",2023-02-02 23:10:43,1548,True

Every time I dream about something I really like  (cars/sports bikes) I can never get to use them, I always do something before using them and when I want to use them they just vanish or are not there anymore. Yesterday I dreamed that I was going to see my dad ( I haven’t seen him in over 10 years) and when I was in his town I never got to his house because the gps kept taking me to random places but never his house.

so it all started with me being at an house that my family and i use to live at apparently in the dream my older brother gave me his phone and once i grabbed the phone i heard my mom yelling and complaining  about me  not picking up the phone when she called me on my phone  and that she needed me to do something for her i tried to explain to her that in the dream that i lost my phone and maybe if i wasn't being rushed by my family i wouldn't loose sight of my phone then after i said that it went into a complete heated argument between me and her she started complaining about many thing's about me and saying that i'm being disrespectful i started breaking down crying screaming at her about the many time's she have treated me like **** and pointed out how she never respected my boundaries and space and never been considerate enough to actually be kind to me for once and not pick a fight with me every so often she then went silent and then started shouting again and telling me once she comes home she will beat my **** i said do it and that i'm not scared of her and if she hurts me then i will hurt her back i went back to arguing with her and then i hung the phone up i then quickly packed my bags and tried to sneak out the house by going out the window to run away apparently my dad was at the front door cooking a barbecue sine after i jumped out the window and decided to go to the front of my house to run to somewhere i spotted my dad and i completely hide under stairs idk where my surroundings  was at the time because now i forgot a few random cats saw me and walked towards me my dad noticed the cats going towards the stairs i was scared because i did not want him to see me outside by myself with a bag paced full of things i did not want to be caught and then my dream ended.

&amp;#x200B;

the strange part is that inside the dream is actually some stuff happened irl i actually lost my phone irl due to the fact i was being rushed by my siblings for school we were not running late tho and i was ready for school i was only waiting for them until they started yelling for no reason i still feel mad at  that moment but i did not think i would dream of this also when i woke up i choked",2023-02-02 22:03:09,2519,True

I only remember the end. I was on a kanoe with my friend J and maybe two others, i dont quite remember. I was laying on the kanoe and looking up at the trees. In the trees I saw apples. Huge apples. Bigger than bowling balls. Huge. Greenish colored. I pointed them out to my friends. Eventually we got far enough down the stream we ended up at a boat dock. Everything was green and blue and beautiful and tranquil. Then a man appeared. Everything around us remained peaceful except for the angry man. He was dressed in mostly grey and maybe camo. Dark gray hair and beard, an older man. He was angry but the world around him did not care and remained calming. He started yelling at me and mostly my friend J. He just kept yelling at J and tried to grab him and pull him off the kanoe. I dont think he succeeded and the dream ended there

So basically I was friends w these girls for so long and we were super close like sisters. But then I think we had to part ways cos of college or sth. Anyways we cried a lot said good luck and held a small gathering. So I’m walking back home w my friend when I go through my messages I accidentally clicked on the archive button and saw this creepy guy spamming me constant texts. He had his profile picture up so I knew what he looked like. So as I’m walking w my friend I walk past a guy who looks exactly like him and then I realised he was stalking me. I tried to go into a random shop w my friend and he was outside looking around. I was crying cos I wanted my mom to pick me up and missed her. Then we made eye contact and I didn’t want to frustrate him so I greeted him back. He introduces me to his group of friends and 
apparently they were gonna cook dinner at this house they rented. There were a group of adults as well (possibly his relatives). Though I remember this one lady who was a therapist and she was talking about her experiences and I thought that I should tell her about this creep and find a way out. But then the adults were cooking and there was a huge fire they tried to brush it off as “just some heat” but the therapist knew it wasn’t good so she took my hand and we ran out of the house.

I dodge the cars easily and I get into part of town where it's almost completely dark, I get mad and when she finally pay attention I yell at her ""It's **** stuck."" My dream ends there.

310,Dreams,Dream that seems to have changed my life.,"So this is my first time Reddit post so… please bare with me.

It was Saturday night.  Jan 28, 2023.

I fell asleep on the couch like I normally do,  woke up around 3 am, totally awake.  Got up. Got the coffee **** ready for later.  Had a smoke. Grabbed a drink etc.  sat back down and decided to put on a Netflix documentary.  It was far more engrossing than I had anticipated and stayed up to finish the whole thing.
By this time it was about 5 am and I figured I should just go back to sleep.

I lay there on the couch,  puppy laying between my legs.  Just a normal night.

Eventually I start to doze off.  And suddenly I’m jolted awake.   No reason.  Just happens.     The odd thing is this happens about 8 times.
After these events I finally feel myself drifting again and I can literally feel myself fighting it,  talking to myself if you will.  Basically talking myself into fighting the urge to wake up.  It’s strange and I’ve never had the feeling before but it was like I was waking myself up cause my conscious didn’t want me to go to this place.

I finally start to feel myself fall asleep.  The moment that happens I’m just totally blown away by… what felt like sleep paralysis (I’ve had this happen before). Although,  this time,   It wasent terrifying.  I almost had like a “**** you here we go!” Mentality… i power through it and suddenly I get up… but I’m not awake,  I leave the couch and head to the window, which is eye level to me.   I suddenly realize I’m looking through my dogs point of view,   I head down the hallway, seemingly in control, to the back window.  I think I knew I was sleeping, or atleast on another level…. I definitely knew I wasent awake.

Then it gets even more strange…

These next few seconds were somewhat of a blur but as far as I can recall I essentially jumped through the window like it was some portal.

I end up in a war torn….I really don’t know what it was.   Almost felt like a ww2 bunker.  Or even “no mans land”.  (Ww1 trench warfare scene).  

Dark,  gloomy,  brown,  grey,   Possibly artillery holes.   Just very…. Apocalyptic.

Suddenly I end up with a group of soldiers.   A few really disheveled looking,   A few looking like they’re going to a business meeting, very clean black and white uniforms.

They address me as one of their own,  like I saw all of this situation go down.   I go along with it but I also have somewhat of a vague dream memory of this. Everything that happened here.

I don’t know where I am, or who these people are.

Just a memory.

I don’t even know what the memory is/was, I only know that I had one.

The specifics become kind of a blur after this point but I end up working for ****, disposing of rockets.  For a time being they don’t suspect anything yet I know I’m not allied with these soldiers.  I’m just blending in.

A double agent if you will.

At some point they realize what or who me and a few others are and we’re allowed to work and congregate in what appeared to be an underground prison cell block  


This dream ends and I’m suddenly sent into a different dream 

I’m a teacher at my school district.

I show up for work and everyone seems suprise to see me.
I remember showing up and walking around like Andy dufresne in Shawshank redemption.  Like I had walked through a world of **** and came out the other side clean.



The strange part about this is I bought a bottle of bourbon and a case of Ben that day, normally I would have finished this by the end of the weekend and 100% been out by Monday.   I drink.   A lot.

It is now a week later and I still have the same bottle and case of beer.  I also smoke about half as much as before.

I only realized this a day or 2 ago when all this came in to perspective.

I feel like this was my subconscious avoiding the topic then me powering past it and faced my issues through a dream.  I’m not intentionally trying to drink or smoke less.   It’s just happened.   Sounds strange but I’m just throwing this out there in case somebody has experienced anything similar.",2023-02-02 20:57:14,4025,True
311,Dreams,Dreamt of pulling The King,"

Last night I had a dream that my friend invited me to a city excursion to the largest building in out city, so that we could go to the top and vibe. We didnt get to the top, though, because I soon got separated. At around the 74th floor (although it felt like the 7th—there was no fatigue at all despite taking the stairs) there was merch *on* the stairs.

 There were tarot card sets and the like.

 Curious, I upended one up to find massive white cards. I overturned the first card on the deck—the imagery was of a white and pink holographic astronaut, and beneath it said ""THE KING"". not the king of anything—just the King. 

It didn't particularly interest me—I'm quite scatterbrained and flighty in public due to the stimulus—but then again I've never pulled a tarot card in a dream! And even now I can still envision it in perfect clarity. Any idea of what this card could mean? I think it would be cool if that deck existed irl, but ofc I have no idea!!

312,Dreams,Strange dream in need of interpretation,"So, a bit of background,  about 5ish years ago, I had a boss who was a very cruel woman.  She was verbally and emotionally abusive, to the point where when she fired me,  she put on documentation that it was because I was ""too incompetent to live, much less work here"".

Last night I had a dream.  I was in some suburban city, that I recognized.  I knew I had to walk home,  but I was carrying a large backpack with me and I knew it was a very long way (a few hours on foot). Doable, but highly unpleasant. 

As I started on my way home, my cruel boss pulled up in a car and offered me a ride home. I was naturally suspicious because of her cruelty, but when faced with the long walk, I agreed to take the ride. 

While in the car, she was surprisingly nice to me. We didn't talk about work or my job or anything, but she was still making polite conversation.

When I'd gotten home, I pulled out my backpack and she even helped carry it inside. After that, she left, and then I woke up. 

I haven't seen the woman in a long time. And while I used to hurt pretty badly over what she'd done to me, I put it to bed years ago. Any thoughts or ideas? 

TLDR: My evil ex-boss gave me a ride home and was kind to me. Haven't spoken to her in over 5 years.",2023-02-02 20:39:42,1248,True
314,Dreams,First Time I wasn't the Main Character...,"Last night I wasn't the main character in my dream. That would go to my dream friend Oliver. So we were in LA going on a blind date. But before this we were at a date meet up type facility where partners were matched at random, and after the date we would decide if we would continue to go out. There was this popular girl he was with, while I was with this really shy girl with glasses. I was having a good time, but he seemed kind of nonchalant. So, we go to eat, and then get in trouble with the law because someone pooped on the road. However, suddenly a large tornado shows up and I tell the group we need to find shelter. But when we leave Oliver's not with us, and there is this alien (Bigchill) fighting the tornado to where it dissipates. Then the dream skips to when we accept them as our gf or not. When I'm in there I notice my date and Oliver seem to be more talkative than before, alongside his blind date. I also realize that he has the omnitrix. Two and two start to go together. My date and his date decide to go out with him, leaving me as the fourth weel. So, he grows a harem. It turns out that my date really isn't human, and was sent to keep and eye on Oliver. The thing is her true from (just the most attractive woman imaginable) was gorgeous. She wore black threads that emphasized all the curves she had. They (you know what) would pretty much flop around everytime she moved. He was romantically involved with both girls (I think) but treated glasses more like a pet (she liked it since that was how her species true nature was). I was out and about playing the side character role where I would have a running gag of trying to sneak inappropriate pictures of her. This one moment had her doing provactive poses (on purpose) but she messed up my phone camera to where every picture would be blurry. Then of course she would laugh at me, and saddle up to Oliver afterwords. Long story short, I ended up going on a journey being the side character as Oliver fought tornadoes with the omnitrix, getting support from his harem (the glasses girl being smoking hot, I tell you) and me being thrown to the role of a pervy side character. Might be my first memory of being delegated to a side character in my own dream.",2023-02-02 20:31:31,2238,True
315,Dreams,Same sort of dream every night,"Every night in my dreams I have the ability to fly, move stuff with my mind, and pass through solid walls or glass. Sometimes in the dreams I have to focus for these abilities to work.

316,Dreams,I often dream about being followed or chased,"All my nightmares or negative-leaning dreams are about being followed. I don't know why. Usually it's either some creepy-looking person (usually an adult), spiders or some invisble spear-throwing creatures (oddly specific, I know). For context, I'm 13, arachnophobic and have abusive parents (****, verbal and emotional abuse).

One of them was about being in a car ride with my mom, iirc. We were on some empty-looking highway. I saw a bald dude with a very creepy face. He looked like he was in his 50s-60s and was a bit overweight. First, we tried to drive away, but he kept on following us and I think he was on the roof of our car at some point. My mom decided to swerve to hit him, and luckily there wasn't anything gorey. But a bit later, there were hundreds and thousands of the same guy walking behind our car, trying to get to us. All of him staring right at me with his creepy eyes. I was scared, but soon we made it to our ""destination"" and we stopped at a shoe store. It was pretty wide and mostly empty, except for one or two cashiers. My memory is a bit bad, I can't seem to remember the rest. This was a year or two ago. Maybe three. Around the time I realized my dad was sexually abusing me. There was no dialogue in the dream, iirc.

Another one, this summer, was about being in some weird mall-like building. First, I was in the top floor, taking care of puppies with some nice-looking people and probably also my cousins. That was like half the dream, but my memory of that is pretty fuzzy. All I remember is that there were a few quest-like tasks I had to do (e.g. bring something to help take care of the puppies). But then, I went down the elevator and the dream changed a lot. There were many people I knew from both the schools I used to go to and the school I go to now. All of them were girls. My best friend (from my old school) and I were going to the bathroom, and in there were 4ish other people and an emo-looking creepy girl from my current school that I know very well. She said some weird thing in another language, and it felt like she was trying to curse us. We left and somehow figured out that if we make eye contact with her she'll put a curse on us, and warned the others.

Then it was this stressful chase thing. ""Watch out, she's coming this way!"" Everyone departed in different directions. We went up elevators and stairs. Then she was targeting me and my best friend. My best friend and I got separated while trying to run away from her. I went back to the top floor, which was now something like a hotel suite. I panicked a little while trying to look for a hiding place, and settled for hiding in the bedroom under the bed. She walked into the room, and without even looking at me, she said, ""I know you're hiding under the bed."" I freaked out and when she turned her back I found a bag and hid in it. She then somehow summoned a bunch of concrete around me, pretty much trying to box me in. I managed to break it with my mind somehow and ran into the (tiny) bathroom. It had two doors, which I locked. Then my best friend appeared and said, ""come here, I can hide you somewhere safe"". There was suddenly a door in one of the walls and we entered another bedroom and locked it, too. She asked me, ""what do you wish for right now?"" and then I realized I was dreaming. It could've become a lucid dream, but I was too anxious and said, ""I just wanna die"". And then I closed my eyes and there were a hundred things rushing through my head. I tried to get myself to a calming beach and continue lucid dreaming but then I woke up, presumably from the anxiety.

A third one, more recent. Pretty much a few weeks ago, maybe a month. I was walking through this weird chain of stores with my mom again. Like, we'd walk out of one store and be in another. We'd go from store to store, and then we started noticing this creepy, shady-looking couple following us. They'd get closer and closer and every time I'd get more and more suspicious of them. At some point, we were at a tiny store that seemed to sell random things (gum, shoes, even magazines). My mom either left for a moment or I split off from her. The couple tried to approach me, so I ran. They chased me, and I was in some weird place in between two buildings. It wasn't a dead end but from my POV I couldn't see what was past that. The couple tried to grab me, and I think they were either going to attack me or **** me. I threw my sandal at them and left. The dream ended. (I don't remember ever being ****, but idk, I have a lot of repressed memories)

317,Dreams,I keep having nightmares where I'm being chased by something on the staircase?,"I keep having nightmares where I'm being chased by something (my mother, monsters, serial killers, anything) while I'm trying to go down to the ground floor so I can get help.

318,Dreams,Solved a riddle to kill an evil door,"So I unfortunately don't dream often, I sleep well, but rarely dream regardless. But once when I did dream, I dreamt that I was a sort of security detail at a magic school. The world seemed like one of those magic webtoon worlds; spell circles, magic towers, demons, etc. 

Now, when I popped into subconsciousness, I was quickly rivaled by a demon door monster that was summoned in a bustling hall. It looked like a regular door, but with like demonic details and eyes, and occasionally, it opened a portal through it to let demons through. And naturally, as it was out to terrorize the aspiring witches and wizards, I, the security detail, was sent to annihilate it. 

Well, that demon door wasn't having it. Somehow, ever spell me and my associates seemed to hurl at it, they all bounced off and hit the walls and ceiling, nearly injuring a staff member. So we paused, and I noticed a demonic glyph along the edge of the door, reading;

A golden sword, both short and thin, 
With hurrying haste, remove their skin,
For only then, with pelting skill,
Will thou destroy what haunts you, still.

Reasonably, in my sluggish dream-state, I was absolutely befuddled by this riddle, and so were my security associates. After a bit of thinking, and the demon door about to unleash, more demons, I suddenly found the answer, ""A banana!""

Oh yeah, this was a dream alright. 

Someone from the surrounding crowd yelled, ""Here!"" And threw it to me. I peeled the skin off if the banana, and threw it at the door. As it squished against the door, it suddenly looked down at the fallen banana fruit and looked back up, saying, ""Damn."" before collapsing in on itself like a black hole and vanishing with a poof.

We all rejoiced and celebrated, and then I woke up, feeling utterly confused on what had happened, and even more so astounded that I had solved a riddle my own subconscious had completely made up.

So yeah, very cool, hope to have more like it in the future!",2023-02-02 20:13:01,1958,True

I think its supposed to be some sort of guro fetish video and I get scared because Freddy Fazbear is gonna chomp off Charles Whites head but I always look away and wake up.

321,Dreams,A piece of meat,"I dreamt I tossed aside all of me except for a little piece of flesh, then moved as that tiny piece while absorbing other things and growing.

Irl I have a problem where my head hurts and I start thinking and doing things I usually wouldn't like sh etc, while remembering some bad things. In the dream, I had an episode of those and because of it everyone hated me.

I was being chased by people I knew irl that used monsters or turned into monsters. I ended in a path in a dark forest that had fleshy parts. The flesh was greyish and if I touched it it consumed me.

There was a red haired girl who was apparently creating some sort of lifeform, which was that greyish meat. She took me into a house made entirely out of that thing in hopes it would eat me. The house would sort of reshape itself on the walls or so in the shape of screaming people and snakes, as if it was filled by other lifeforms it had already eaten. There was a strange man with a huge head and an open mouth resting somewhere near the entrance, connected to the wall.

I escaped by letting myself melt into some sort of worm-like being and going through a small opening, then leaving most of my body behind to make her think she found me.

I slowly gained mass by eating other things like grass or dust. People knew I did this to escape and then chased me to use me in experiments rather than to just **** me.

It was a half lucid dream, I couldn't shape shift as I usually can, but the shape of a piece of meat felt just right. Trapped in a chunk of flesh trying to shape itself into something, having the places I could belong into taken away by myself and my disorders, or something like that.

I felt mostly just alone and hurt, but some people in the dream would help me or be kind. Something happened with my mother feeling hurt and trying to help me... But I can't remember what exactly. At one point I sang a song made by the screams of a hurt soul. 

It brought up certain painful feelings back to surface. Been having a horrible headache all day.",2023-02-02 19:33:39,2030,True

326,Dreams,Exploding Sun Supernova,"I had this dream somewhere around January 20th. I walked outside of my house to my parents, it was only me and them, even though I have several other siblings. From where we are, the moon is visible during the day, so we saw it. Behind the moon was a flash of light, then a purple, red and I think orange supernova. Then, it began to look white and had that red, somewhat green and yellow shine on it that you get sometimes when light hits a camera at a certain angle, like a reflection of the colors. In the dream, my mom grabbed my arm after my dad made the comment, “Nope, see? There it goes, the vegetables and crops.” I think he was referring to stuff disintegrating because after my mom and I turned around to run, I felt every cell in my body disintegrate. I woke up to that feeling, and the last part to feel it was my neck on the right side.

327,Dreams,Most disturbing dream I've ever had.. Woke up in another world and instantly knew this one wasn't real.,"I had this dream some months ago, and despite it not having the most overtly scary imagery, affected me more than any other dream I've ever had in my 42 years on this Earth. 

I woke up some on kind of table in a small room with other tables, but I was alone. I sat up and hung my legs off the table. I was wearing a drab featureless grey jumpsuit and I was slimmer than I should be. I felt confused and began to look around but within moments my confusion was completely gone, I realized I left this world but I was somehow completely unconcerned with its loss, even though I enjoy my life. The confusion was quickly replaced with concern for my wife and daughter (I have no children in reality) and an overwhelming fear that told me I had to find them and escape this place. 

I rushed out of the room and I was I seemed to be aboard some kind of space habitat, with large windows with just black starry space. As I ran through some rooms I entered a large commons area, with people just going about their day, people walking with their children, using transparent tablets, sitting down talking to each other. They didn't seem to pay me any mind. I slowed down trying to look casual but I seemed to know where I was going. My heart was pounding and I was in a cold sweat. I got most of the way through the room and a door on the far side opened and through it entered a pair of security guards who looked like they were in a rush as well. They immediately spotted me and started running towards me. They didn't speak. I ran out of the room and down an adjacent hallway, right into two more guards. I tried to pass by them, but they were carrying a long black stick, and one of them just tapped me with it, I felt a slight buzz and then my body just went completely limp. No pain. I didn't feel anything and I couldn't move. They caught me before I hit the ground and started carrying me down some side corridor that looked like a maintenance tunnel. I seemed to have blacked out. 

I awoke as I was being placed on a bench chest first that sat upwards at a slight angle with my arms dangling down over the edges. I couldn't move my limbs but I could weakly turn my head and I could speak. There was a robot in the room with me, doing something briefly on a console. It spun around at the waist, legs still facing the console. It had one normal right hand, and a left hand that was some kind of device, that had ports on a rail, that slid out and formed a shape similar to a clothing hangar if it was holding the hook, and it pressed it along my spine. I didn't feel the contact but I felt an electrical sensation (like those suction cups with sponges and a light electrical current used in physical therapy) for just a moment and I could no longer even move my head. It spoke in a very robotic voice ""Relax. Everything will be alright."" I was immediately and strangely disgusted by the statement, and I replied something to the effect of ""The empty words of an unfeeling machine."" to which it replied ""Affirmative."" and then the hand device collapsed down into two points and it pressed them against my skull directly behind my right ear. I very smoothly over the next few moments felt my perceptions leave that world and enter this one. I was laying in my bed feeling extremely disturbed and doubting reality. I kept touching the area behind my ear.

Usually when I wake up from a bad dream (which are very rare for me) it is usually because I become aware that I am dreaming and I always close my eyes and say ""No."" and force myself awake and it's very abrupt. This was so gradual it really freaked me out. The fear and need to find my wife and daughter was so intense.

I had to reflect on that dream for some time to find as many holes in it as I could so I could make myself feel better about believing it that it was just a dream. Eventually I found enough, but still like I said.. Not the scariest imagery I've ever had in a dream, I've dreamt I got attacked by aliens and such. But the fear in my dreams never felt quite so real. So intense. And that smooth transition from dream to waking where I didn't seem to lose continuity of consciousness.. ugh.

 Anyway, it felt good to put that out there. Thanks for taking the time to read it.

EDIT: I can't edit the title, should have said while I was in this dream I was convinced that the waking world was the one that was fake, not that I still believe it is after analyzing it.",2023-02-02 17:40:17,4437,True
328,Dreams,Murdering a woman,"**INTRO**

I've never experienced these type of dreams before, and I've never dreamed of killing someone before. A couple years back when I was a little younger, I remember dreaming of crying to my parents about losing a small pet, now I've become more desensitized to empathy and gore. This dream had just happened today.

I've tried being christian and have had a questionable relationship with ****. Sometimes I blame him for the things I've done, and sometimes I pray and thank him for creating this environment. Just before I had gone to bed, the time was 11:11, the angels are telling me I'm in a bad environment, but they're helping me guide to the right path. This isn't uncommon, and almost happens everyday.

**DREAM**

I can't recall most of my dream, but I do remember it being set around my old house, near the kitchen. It was a bright day and I couldn't see past the windows, they were filled with a bright white light. I was arguing with a woman who was slightly shorter than me and looked familiar. All I can recall is that she had long, straight black hair.

It started escalating to physical harm until I finally snapped and took a nearby tool and started stabbing her with it. I kept stabbing her until she fell on her fours. She was crying and begging me to let her go, but I digressed and yelled at her to shut up. It took a nearby knife that was long enough, and and I started to poke the point towards her Adam's apple.

Her whole spinal cord was exposed, and I put all of my effort to cut it open. Once it did snap in two it started to bleed a lot, a lot of stains were on the walls, and she started to slow down. I didn't see her die as I rushed myself into the bathroom to look at myself. I looked in the mirror and I recall panicking these lines: ""I murdered her. I'm a sinner."" I ran out the bathroom cussing, unsure what to do. And then I woke up.

**OUTCOME**

What really scared me is that when I arrived at school I was told some younger year had a kitchen knife in their backpack, and one of my friend's moms had died from a heart attack. Both at the same day I had this dream.

I need opinions if all of this has meaning or not, and I'm really worried about it.",2023-02-02 17:23:50,2195,True

It felt so real and was so uncomfortable I thought my sister was messing with me, but we don't do that anymore. The second it felt like someone was smothering or hugging me really tightly. The third I was sleeping and could feel someone press into my mattress near my legs and behind my back. Each dream only occurred once, but they share similar themes of black and white lighting and the different POVs.

Last night I dreamt I was trapped in my bedroom, the lighting was very dim and yellow/pink, like my desk lights. My door and the windows wouldn't open, and I remember feeling very out of control and afraid. Then I sensed another me in the room, telling me to go back to bed. I couldn't see her perfectly, but I could just tell. I laid down on my left side and heard her hum and feel her kiss around me. Then she touched my back and I \*felt\* it, and everything felt like it was melting and I was gaining control again.

337,Dreams,WTF is my subconscious doing,"I have a bizarre-**** dream lately. I don't know why.

I'm out walking, and a HGV goes past. And in my dream universe, a lorry going past is *the most ghoulish, terrifying, absolute nope thing in the world.* I am deathly afraid of that HGV. I feel horrified by how huge it is and how it could splat me into gelatine and how if a wild animal were wandering in the road I'd have no hope of snatching them out of its path. I feel an alarming sensation in my lower back as if someone has shoved a sharp object directly into my adrenal gland, a needle or electrode, I am unsure exactly. I feel it go right to the medulla. I don't experience that type of pain when awake ever, only my dreams. It seems to be psychological...as if that lorry going past is just so fearsome that even the **** responsible for fight/flight goes nope and gives up. Or someone intentionally does something to it.

??!!??!!?!?!!?!!?

This is not something that features in my waking life in the slightest.

339,Dreams,a dream experience I've never had before,"I don't know if anyone cares about the details I might make another post about it. But the other night I had a dream that has haunted me and messed with me ever since. It was a crazy experience I've never felt before with a dream and that's that it felt so real, everything about it felt sincere and euphoric with the events that happened and real and when I woke up at first I felt happy but it quickly changed to confusion and discomfort and left me depressed.",2023-02-02 14:48:34,462,True
340,Dreams,Can you help me understand this dream??,"BACKSTORY: All my life I have had very lucid dreams. I usually remember them. I started smoking **** in my teens and my dreams were very suppressed. I barely had any, it was somewhat comforting because of how intense they always were. There were times when I would quit **** for a while and my dreams would ramp up. I started writing them down. I almost filled an entire journal but decided to smoke again because it freaked me out. Anyway, I'm sober again and I have decided to stay sober. Its been about a month and a half and my vivid dreams are ramping up again.

DREAM: Last night I dreamt I was sitting in front of a vanity and there was a woman sitting next to me to my right, I got the impression she was a shaman or a witch. She was Thai, that's what I knew in my dream (don't ask me how, I just knew) I think we knew each other. She was helping me remember something or trying to convey a message to me. She leaned over and inhales a huge mist of green and her face changed to a demon type green makeup/mask. It was like her face shapeshifted. I wasn't afraid. She spoke in a very calm tone and mumbled something to me. I can't remember what it was. Just then my husband came home in my dream with a coworker. When I looked back at the woman, there was only a man with a beard and a small woman I didn't know. They sat there in silence. I woke up.

AFTREMATH: I was looking at different Thai masks and makeup, her face was painted like Yaksha. I have never seen this mask before today. I will also note that I recently started wearing a jade bangle for good luck. Its probably not related but it did come from overseas.

Before you say, ""its because you stopped smoking pot"", I have ALWAYS had crazy vivid dreams like this. I will probably start recording them again.

Thanks in advance for any insight.",2023-02-02 14:39:47,1813,True
341,Dreams,Honestly had the worst dream/nightmare of my life recently,"Context - When I was in the army, I had met a lot of people that felt like family to me. They were the best people I have ever met and I miss them everyday still. I left a few years ago to pursue a better paying job through college.

I was dreaming of them last night. I dreamt that I was with them and they were doing army things - logistics, paperwork, PT, drill, but they could not see me. I think they were all really happy and I wanted to be with them, but nothing I did in the dream got their attention. It stung real bad, to not be noticed by your former best friends, to have lost that comradery. Then, everybody marched on without me. I was just a ghost or something - in both the dream and in real life, I probably don't matter to them anymore.

I woke up in a cold sweat and felt devastated. This dream was very vivid and I don't think I want to relive it again if I'm being honest.

342,Dreams,Bad thoughts,This is a question and I’m not sure it’s allowed here but I am honestly lost so turned to Reddit to try and find an answer so ever since I was young I have had these dreams and before we start it’s nothing interesting but my thoughts these dreams are terrifying and one of the most scary things I have experienced but I don’t actually know what they are?? I was thinking maybe something like a panic attack but I don’t have any illness or anxiety that I know off but I remember going down to tell my mum one thing and that was “Bones” I just kept repeatedly saying bones while sobbing and then she took me back up to my bedroom and I fell back to sleep. There was another time I woke up and texted my friend “Hey have you ever seen that AD where thousands of people die while trying to get into a store. I read the text the same morning and was horrified as I don’t even remember writing it. Please if someone has a shared experience please share as I have never met anyone with the same issue.

344,Dreams,Frequent apocalyptical dreams,"I don't dream that often, or at least don't remember many dreams, but the ones I do remember tend to be apocalyptic. Example: last night I dreamt that I watched a planet-sized asteroid hit another planet (could visibly see this from Earth so the planet was very close to ours) and this sent massive shockwaves across Earth and sent everything into chaos. Huge chunks of the ground were rising, earthquakes, fire etc. And all I could do was run down a street and hope I don't die. 

Another example is running through a dystopian wasteland trying to avoid aliens that had invaded the Earth and killed most of the planets population.

I really wish I could draw/animate all of these things I dream but unfortunately I'm not that artistic.

Does anyone know what this could mean? Is it something to be concerned about or needs to be addressed?",2023-02-02 14:19:55,840,True
345,Dreams,I’ve never had a dream like this let alone one I can actually remember,"I was outside in a field during the daytime and a women who I have never seen before approached me, she looked wild not homeless but wild. She was a bit taller than I am (I’m 5’2) had long unbrushed black hair, whiteish gray clay or paint on her skin that was chipping, and was wearing something made of old cloth, I’m struggling to describe it but something that looked like it was from the 10th century like old cloth with no patterns. On her forehead was a black V like tattoo. I have been trying to find the exact symbol online for over an hour and I can’t find it. The strangest part about it is that i know this description sounds kinda scary but I felt safe when I saw her. She told me she was my mother. (I feel like it’s important to add that she looks NOTHING like me real mother who is alive and well. And we have a good relationship) I believe she was some kind of magical being/ witch/ or demon I really don’t know but she wasn’t human. But again, I didn’t feel scared and i’m the type of person that can’t watch Coraline or nightmare before Christmas, let alone actual scary movies. I don’t remember anything else that was said or if anything was even said between my “mother” and I. Then my alarm went of, I hit snooze to finish my dream but when i closed my eyes I was in the same place with my “mother” but now some random person I know was with us, they said to me who’s ur friend? I remember I smiled and didn’t hesitate to answer “this is my mother”, and turned to look at my “mother” who was standing next to me but now she was dress in normal  clothes, with brushed hair, and her forehead symbol was gone. I just stared at her in awe since a second ago the women looked how I described early. The random person I know said to my “mother” , “it’s nice to meet you, oops it likes like u have a spec of dirt on ur face and reach over to get it, but when she started to rub it, I could tell the speck of dirt was actually part of her forehead symbol that was peaking out under a layer of makeup used to conceal it.

I never knew counting 123 could be so hard if you completely forget what a number is...lol, anywho, to best describe what I saw, it was like anything you can think of just floating all around you name it I saw it everything and I had to fix it.

Some giant creature came over myself and the other being and smashed all that we have worked on. During the rebuild, something was amiss.

Someone evil was after me and I was unaware because for a very long time this evil has be suppressed and kept hidden. As were the powers these other people had - but they couldn't keep it under wraps for long. At one point I was being chased but the good guys were leading me to safety. One person could morph into a small moth/frog creature. Small enough to fit into your hand. He got badly hurt protecting me and I remember holding him in my hand as I made it back to the group of others. I was also in a bathing suit, because once I got to the group I was looking through a lost and found box for something to cover up. They took the moth frog from me in the meantime. That's when the instant click happened. As I rummage for clothes, I'm confused, not sure what the heck is going on, I make eye contact with the guy who's more or less the leader of the others. Like in the movies, time stops and in a crash-like instant everything starts again. This guy was tall, attractive, (ok totally hot and out of my league). There is a feeling of dread as the others are worrying, eventually I find something to toss on and after that, Mr. tall dark, emo with his long hair muscular tatted arms comes over and just stands by me. You can feel that radiating warmth and security and at some point as that dread gets worse I am pulled against his body. His hard, protective body.

358,Dreams,Dream where my dad tried to kill me,"The dream started fairly normal, my school does tours a lot so we had a tour over. Thing is we weren't in normal classes, i was stuck in my theatre class having a ""water balloon fight"" but the water balloons were filled with paint. 

School ends, after I was struck twice in the chest by said paint balloons. And I have a pickle for some reason, I hate pickles. 

My friend (who well call Q) points out that my mom is here. Earlier in my dream my mom mentioned she'd be coming to our after school event. (we have these often too, were having a board game night in this particular dream) 

I come up and hug her, to find her standing by a table of three upperclassmen, (one of whom I've had a crush on, one I've worked in two shows with,  and I had a weird dream about anther one) and a teacher (who I've never seen) 

She starts talking to the teacher about coming with us to a concert my brother's coming to later that night, when suddenly she realizes we have to make something for my cousins birthday. She suggests something healthy, but  I make a joke saying 'not in this family' this is when my aunt appears. (She's also my cousin, but I call her my aunt because she's older than me and has her own children) she says something agreeing with me and her and my mom begin to talk to each other about what to bring. 

This is when my dad comes up to me, I had known he had been there but I didn't say hi because I was talking to the other people. 

Now this might be important to the story, but I have this weird thing with when things are around my neck, i can handle necklaces but anything else freaks me out. People could briefly touch my neck and I'll literally freak out, and this has led me to a conclusion that I'm scared of being strangled. He knows this. 

Anyways, my dad comes up and he has a bowl from our house in his hands, we have these bowls from when we were kids, the type with the straw built in for cereal and things like that. I don't use them because I feel like it's unsanitary, but I'm also paranoid about weird things like that 

So he hugs me and the straw presses against my neck, i tell him to stop and he tells me I'm being over dramatic he presses it a bit closer, i try to tap out and suddenly i feel the pressure on both sides of my neck. I'm still trying to get him to stop and it seems like other people are too, I'm coughing and begging him and I feel ither people trying to pull him off, eventually I use one of my nails (I have really long fingernails) and drive it into his leg, which takes forever until he finally releases me, but by then I'm seeing only black and then I wake up.

363,Dreams,Weird dreaming while sleep stages change,"I had a dream last night that had 2 polar opposite genres.

The first part of the dream was relatively reasonable, compared to most of my dreams. 
WW3 had broken out. The USA government set a draft in place. The 1st names to be called were less likely to see combat (a lot of names were called). The 2nd we’re more likely to see combat (some names were called). The 3rd were definitely going to see combat (a few were called). My husband and I waited anxiously as the list was read. We felt relief as the last name was called, and it was not one of ours…
Just before we could relax, we hear a knock…
Tier 4. Special Opps - Will probably die in combat. A secretive tier that only those involved know. 
“Hello, sir. Is your name Erick Ray?”
… yes… yes it is…
“You have been drafted for the 4th Tier”
Horror. I watched as my husband stood expressionless. They didn’t give him any time to think. 
“Come with us, sir”
I ran to the door as they took my husband from me. There was a line of 10 other men, just standing nearby with the same lifeless face - the other ones chosen. As soon as the officers and my husband reached the other men, they instructed all of them to head out. 
“WAIT!” I cried. “Is that it?! You’re just taking him!?” 
One officer stepped aside to deal with me, as the the rest of the officers and drafted men kept walking, “We know this is difficult, ma’am, but it must be done this way. Have a good day”
“No time for goodbye?! What about his things!?”
The officer proceeded to walk away, ignoring my inquest.
“STOP!”
They kept walking.
In that moment, I understood. The government was going to get there way, and there was nothing- nothing- I could do about it. And if you can’t beat them, join them. So that what I did. I ran up to my husband, and joined him.
The officers stopped the line and angrily stood up to me. I couldn’t hear what they were yelling, everything was just a blur. All I did know was that my husband  looked at me horrified, “My love, you can’t be here. You can’t come with me. This… this is a death sentence”
“If I can’t live with you, I chose to die with you”

The next part of the dream was kind of fuzzy. I know we did some training, and I know we saw combat. I survived, but my husband disappeared. 

I must’ve switched sleep stages at this point, because the dream just gets bizarre from here.

Myself and some surviving soldiers started collecting our dead. I couldn’t find my husband. Everyone else, dead or alive, was accounted for. My heart sank. There’s no other reason that he wouldn’t be with us unless he was captured or injured in hiding somewhere. 

I took 2 other soldiers and started frantically searching for him. I ran through every building, opening every fridge and cabinet just in case he was in one. After awhile with no luck, I decided to check in the “Museum of Taxidermy and Puppets”

I walked past the still puppets of policemen and circus goers. I walked past stuffed tigers and bears. Suddenly, I stopped in my tracks. A giant stuffed Borzoi dog (the dog with the long face) sat alone in a room. Quietly, I sang, “Mimidoitforyouuuu” and then I knew my husband had to be close by. He’s always close by the Mimidoitforyou sound. I asked one of the soldiers to check the men’s bathroom that was right behind the stuffed dog. He slowly swing the door open… and there, sitting on the toilet pooping, was my husband. I fell to his feet and started sobbing. “I thought I lost you forever” I cried.
“I had to ****” he said. 

For whatever reason, this dream felt real enough to make me wake up. My tears felt real. I must’ve been moving, because my husband, still half asleep, put his arm around me and snuggled me close. I felt happy and safe as I drifted back to sleep.",2023-02-02 11:08:48,3732,True
364,Dreams,So many vivid dreams in one night! (And sleep paralysis),"Second half the night I kept dreaming a short while, waking up, and then falling back asleep. And each dream was wildly different from the next.

1. Dream about zooming through a farm field of plants, watching these millitary generals doing the same around me. They were judt sliding really fast in their feet without trying to move or walk, almost like they were surfing but without a surf board. Also they had no shirts, and were all men. Then we got to a neighborhood with these massive, magnificent trees. I thought they were like elms but at least twice as tall as usual. I spoke ""Oh I know this place, should be safe here"" but then someone with me said they weren't so sure. Then some kind of enemy artillery fire began to rain down on us. The trees began to break and fall over. They looked like they had mourning faces with gaping mouths in the shape of their trunks and branches as they fell. It was then we all realized we had to turn and run away. One shot of enemy fire whizzed past my left ear, narrowly missing me. I then happened upon a young woman, laying on the ground paralyzed in fear. I told her she had to go, in order to live. She then got up, but still didn't move. So I gripped her tightly, and told her we would move together.  

2. Dream about switching cats between rooms. This is a thing we do in real life because one cat doesn't get along with the others. Well he was in a room with someone he didn't get along with, so I went to move him. My room was a complete mess. Huge stacks of things all over the place, and belongs strewn about all over the floor. There were lots of cats as well. Far more than we own in real life. Many scattered as I opened the door. A small yellow-orange kitten remained at the corner of my room in a built-in shelf.  

3. Dream about replacing pillowy bandages on my dad's back as he lay face-down on his bed while Tool's song Vicarious was playing.  

4. Dream about wanting to get a broccoli-beef-cheddar snack mix or stir fry at Walmart or something, and they were all full of rolls of toilet paper carefully and meticulously unrolled to surround just the smallest amount of shaved beef, and nothing else. Then a person I was with grabbed one of them, and revealed a large set of DVDs. The toilet paper began to blow on the wind, and a light was shining from it. Then a really beautiful song I'd never heard before complete with lyrics began to play. But the song was familiar to me within the dream.  

Two sleep paralysis experiences, as well.

1. One where I perceived either the word ""liar"" or ""deceit"" written on something in the middle if my vision before I snapped out of it, and my seeing it filled my with a sense of existential terror and dread. (But of course I couldn't move or get away from looking at it.)  

2. Then later I woke up again to a small figure like a child that looked menacing and scary. When I snapped out of it, I realized it was a shirt hanging on my closet door.",2023-02-02 11:03:41,2956,True

366,Dreams,"I dreamed up a horror movie called ""Day One"", a nonlinear narrative about sinister happenings at an English country retreat.","The protagonist was played by Anya Taylor-Joy.

Title card: ""Day One"".

EXT. Café.

In a scene lit by morning sun, the protagonist and her boyfriend discuss having just arrived at the idyllic estate, and what they will do for the next seven days.

Title card: ""Day Four"".

EXT. Outdoor skating rink.

A montage plays of about 30 people ballroom dancing together on the rink. The protagonist alone is aware of the cut from day one to here, and the cuts within the montage, and repeatedly expresses her confusion and distress.

Title card: ""Day Zero"".

INT. Old-fashioned bus.

An older woman drives a crowded bus on a wooded trail, talking to the protagonist in the passenger seat establishing backstory. They pass by a minor disturbance in a car parked by the side of the road, too quickly for us to see what is happening. As dialog continues, the bus passes under a bridge, briefly casting the driver and protagonist into shadow.

When the sun returns, the driver has vanished and the protagonist is driving the bus. Terrified, she briefly loses control and pulls over.

She decides to check the bus's dashcam to anchor herself to reality. She sifts carefully through her memories and realizes the car on the side of the road was being robbed at gunpoint. But when she checks the dashcam, it simply shows a loving father helping his family load a large umbrella into the car.

This is where I woke up but I could totally see this skipping between major events of the different days, and the protagonist trying to piece together the puzzle, out of order, before it's too late.",2023-02-02 10:45:08,1576,True
368,Dreams,I had a dream like The Matrix,"It was actually like a mix between The Matrix and like LSD. In my dream, if you ate a white powder, you could see the world as it really is. My eyes turned kind of bionic, I guess. They looked like a video game with lots of data about everything that I looked at. And everything was so much more vibrant. I was sitting in my backyard, but it was like it was on the edge of the earth, and there was a bonfire going beside me, and it looked like the bonfire was raining slow moving shooting stars all around me, and it was so beautiful and calming and relaxing. I wish I could just stay in that dream forever, just sitting there and watching the vibrant colors of gold raining down all around me with the night sky and the stars above me.",2023-02-02 10:16:59,736,True

370,Dreams,Had a surreal dream about solo traveling to see sunset of beach. And experienced the same feeling you get after witnessing a sunset.,"My friends as usual decided to ditch me and thought **** it lets travel solo someplace new with better sweet feelings. Next thing I remember i am on a boat with crossing the sea. It's quite cold out there and i am half drenched sitting on a bench from the light showers. My socks are damp and i am little annoyed with it. It's an evening hour and it's very Moody, dull with grey blue sky in the middle of sea. 
 I stumble across a friend and he is just leaving from the town i supposed to visit.
I for some reason come across a chill group of elderly and hang out with them for a bit. 
As i reach my destination i come across a very cozy sad little town and their market. I don't know what to do so i visit a handicraft shop (a gloomy little one with yellow incandescent lights) and come across some amazing woodwork. I beg the owner to teach me and he shoos me away. 
And sunddenly as i am walking passing my time around i end up at this beach spot. Untouched with some mangroves around. The trees are almost touching the sand and i can see light waves from the canopy of it. It's for some reason the golden hour now. The sands look orange and golden and duck is passing by the canopy towards the ocean. It keeps visiting and coming back. And i for some reason taken back with the scene. Just the golden sand, canopy little waves with a silhouette of a duck...

372,Dreams,Boy staring at me Dream,"So a few months ago I wanted to manifest a boyfriend. Then I stopped around last month.
However, last night I dreamed about him:

I was looking at my hair and twirling it- I looked really pretty in my dream. Then I caught this boy (I wanted to manifest ) staring at me. But when I looked at him, he looked away. He also seemed kind of embarrassed about that.

Does that mean, that I should start again with manifesting him? What does this dream overall mean?",2023-02-02 09:35:39,458,True
374,Dreams,I was 2 hours late to work because of my “dream”,"I can’t find an answer anywhere for what type of dreams i have so im gonna ask here. 
Ive always had these weird dreams that i call fixation dreams. It’s usually about something that i was thinking about a lot of researching about that day. or it will be completely random. I don’t really know how to even explain them, it’s like a day dream all night, i will wakeup so much durning the night to where it kinda feels like i was up all night, even when i wakeup it’s like my mind is fixated on it still and even believes it’s true. The dreams aren’t really dreams with pictures tho it’s mainly black in my head but with thoughts, there will be a bit of “real dream” picture type while i’m sleeping but mostly it’s in my thoughts. It’s so uncomfortable because i want to sleep so bad but my mind like NEEDS to (solve, find out, fix) whatever my dream or fixation is about. For example last night it was about me trying to find out if i had cancer on my (hand?) i think. So i was talking to doctors, hospitals, other people with the same cancer, because i had to find out. I’m not gonna go into exact detail but ya it’s just really uncomfortable. This morning my alarm went off for work at 5 something and i woke up to the alarm and literally thought to myself “well obviously i’m not going to work because i have cancer.. i need to go to the doctors not work” So i went back to sleep of course 😳 then i woke up again at 6 something and looked at the time, i was confused at first and couldn’t even think about anything because the “dreams” are so draining, i eventually realized i was sooo late for work. Even when i’m awake for the day it’s like my mind keeps shifting back to the dream and i’ll sometimes mix it up for reality. These dream types things make me late for work like once a week and it’s so bad, i seriously can’t control it and it makes me seem so irresponsible. Does anyone know what these dreams are and how to stop having them?",2023-02-02 09:28:27,1944,True
375,Dreams,Dreams vs Reality,"Does this happen to anyone else? I’ve stopped talking about it in public because it just isn’t received very well. 

One day I (also a manager) asked my general manager about a fellow employee, I said “hey didn’t you tell me that you’re making him a supervisor? And she looked at me like I was insane, saying that she would never even consider that. The other manager in the room also said the same thing however I very distinctly remember having a conversation with both of them in that same office about making him a supervisor. It was then that I realized I may have dreamt the entire interaction which isn’t surprising as my dreams mostly consist of daily normal experiences or situations. 
With this instance in mind I then realized that it’s been happening more and more. Example, I’ll walk into the kitchen in real life and begin looking for a specific appliance that isn’t there but I dreamt it was there or I had purchased it. Same thing with furniture being rearranged amongst other things",2023-02-02 09:21:07,999,True
376,Dreams,A dream about my crush taking a bath with me,"I need help to determine the meaning of a dream I had last night. 
I was with my crush on some kind of vacation, we are very close friends so this wouldn't be a new thing, HOWEVER it became night all of a sudden and i said that i need to go take a shower and they followed me to the bathroom0 and we started talking while i was undressing. 
I didn't feel like i had been violated even though i was completely **** in the bath. I started trying to pull the shower curtains to get some privacy but everytime i turned back around they would open the curtains and continue talking. It happened like 3 times and the 4th time i turbed around they were **** and started getting in the bath with me. I was startled and felt embarrassed, but as soon as they got in i felt comfortable again.
Then they put their left hand on my right breast and looked at me and sat down in the water and i sat down with them too. Nothing happened that was explicit between us it was just us sitting in the water. And as soon as i started finishing up and got out the water that they were in started getting dirty.

Can someone please help if this has a meaning???",2023-02-02 09:10:18,1137,True

I just started watching the Last of Us on HBO and every one of these dreams have been about that 😅😂.

381,Dreams,Dreams and memory,"Last night I had a dream where I was having a conversation with someone (someone I've never met or seen, my brain just made up a new person). While discussing different things and common interests, we got to talking about the subjects we studied in school and what grade we got for each subject.

The weird thing is, when it was my turn to list my subjects, I couldn't remember the last one. I was desperately trying to remember what the subject was, then the guy said ""was it a language type of course?"" Then I said, ""oh yeah of course, it was French!"".

How did he know before I said it? If he inferred from all the other subjects I listed before (all non language subjects), how would he realise this before me? I'm the one having the dream, so surely I should realise at least at the same time as the other guy.

Really made me think about how memory works. My only explanation is that I knew the forgotten subject, then my subconscious was trying to push me towards the answer. But I honestly don't know.

383,Dreams,Unexpected pregnancy dreams,"To clarify I’m a f(22) and currently not in a relationship. And DEFINITELY no way of being pregnant now or in the near future.

It’s been two dreams where I’ve been unexpectedly pregnant. The first dream started off calm as I reminisced living in an old house with my family, even my dad who is now passed on. We were just hanging out in the backyard. Until randomly I was pregnant, I wasn’t shocked in the dream but more so accepted it. There was no mention of any baby daddies nor boyfriend. I just was pregnant, had the kid ( one boy, blonde hair or bald? Idk I’ve had reoccurring dreams when it came to pregnancy or kids and it’s always been twins or a baby boy with blonde hair ) 
And he was just laying on my lap peacefully.

When I woke up it kinda rattled me since I felt very peaceful thinking that if I don’t end up with someone, having a kid by myself would be seem that bad. 


The second dream was different, it was in the same old house and this time again I just was pregnant but at the same time as my godsister. We are both expecting and it’s all exciting until we are waiting to be induced ( I’m not sure if that’s correct terminology but we were just waiting for the water to break? And we were at the hospital but also my old house at the same time) . * btw also no mention of baby daddie or boyfriend *
When we were waiting my godsister was fine, yet for me the nerve set in, mostly about giving  actual birth. It kinda stressed me or more so gf cold feet. I can’t remember if I gave birth or not since I woke up. 

It just felt odd dreaming of pregnancy back to back almost .",2023-02-02 05:53:44,1597,True
384,Dreams,Angel of Death,"I had a dream that I had a young daughter and we lived in a cottage. It was nighttime and she was playing in the garden before bed. I could hear her talking to someone outside, so I went out to see and she said she was talking to an angel. A tad disturbed I asked her to come inside and get ready for bed and she insisted on talking to the angel again. I went to lock the front door and saw an eerie grey angel figure, somewhere between concrete and skin, with large parts of her **** skin falling and crumbling off. As I looked again she was gone and I hurried to my daughter, panicked. I looked over to the window and once again the angel stood there, staring at me. I didn’t know what to do and consciously thought ‘what would I do in a horror film?’ And went to call the police. The line was dead so I picked up my daughter and ran to the car. We drove off down a country lane lined with trees. She was sat in the back in her bumper seat, falling asleep. I felt relieved to get away from the cottage, but as I drove the angel appeared in the passenger seat beside me. I asked the angel what it wanted and it told me it was here to take my daughter. It was an angel of death. I asked why and the angel said I had been hungry for success in the past and the only trade could be my daughters life. I asked if I could trade my own life instead to save her and the angel agreed. So I pulled up beside a lake, and told my daughter to wait there for me with the angel as I went to the shop. I drove off, accelerating into a tree to take my own life. Then I woke up in a hospital bed, and found out my daughter was dead.",2023-02-02 05:45:08,1616,True

387,Dreams,Oof what a wild dream,"The dream went from fun house party to needing to escape captors. In the dream I walked up to an older wood built home (like a farm house), on a deserted road surrounded by trees with 2 friends to go to a house party. The party was in the 2nd floor apartment. When I went to go up the stairs I was greeted by 2 people hanging out on the deck at the top of the stairs, and the stairs were blocked with wood pallets. They laughed, moving the pallets, letting myself and the 2 others i came with in. The apartment seemed normal enough but the hosts seemed very odd. I stepped into a bathroom and as i was closing the door i saw someone i knew and cared about. I called them over into the bathroom to ask them what the heck was going on. They told me I need to get out. This place isn't good. Just then I noticed a camera watching us, and learnt the whole house was rigged up. I knew I needed to escape with this person i cared about (dream person. No one i actually know), but I had to be subtle so the cameras didn't pick up anything and alert the weird hosts/captors. Just then there was a knock on the bathroom door. I acted jovial, like I was partying blowing off the weird host that was ""checking"" on us. My person walked away somewhere into the apartment. I then sat at a desk and made a greeting card. It looked like a folder on the front and inside I wrote ""to my beloved"". The weird host asked me some questions about it as we both admired the card. While this was happening I started wondering if the pallets were blocking the stairs or not. I put the card down and started acting **** and silly with my person moving out onto the deck at the top of the stairs, trying not to alert any of our captors to our pending attempt at escape. Suddenly there was a car that crashed infront of the house in the dirt parking area. I started acting like this was the most amazing thing I ever saw, grabbed my person and started going down the stairs (that weren't blocked), to pretend to look at this car. One of the people that were originally at the top of the stairs tried to stop me but I pretended I was a tippsy fool that had to see this car. I got down the stairs with my person and we walked up to the road. Our captors followed behind us. I knew I needed to do something so I walked infront of a big rig that just happened to be coming down the road. It missed me and didn't stop. Our captors started horsing around and that's when my person grabbed me and said we needed to run. So we began running. Our captors slowly started coming after us but we were faster until it started feeling like I was trying to run through sand. I then started running on all fours, which ended up being pretty fast, and that's when I woke up.",2023-02-02 04:52:30,2728,True

Me-I look like I did at 18
K- Guy I went out with a couple times in HS
R- K’s current wife IRL
Y- Guy that is friends IRL with K
G- Guy that played sports with K and Y


In the dream I’m my 18 year old self and so is everyone else (IRL we’re middle age). I’m married, but my spouse wasn’t there, but a past crush I’ll call K was there with their current spouse R. Then, K’s friend Y was there too. We all rode in the car I had in high school to work on it. They were all friendly and nice to me! We were laughing and joking and I talked to them all more in my dream then I ever have IRL. K was especially nice to me (they were not that nice IRL) but noticeably kept an arms length away from me which made me sad. Then G enters and starts flirting with me almost as much as Y was in the dream. It was the most male attention I’ve had for AWHILE. 

We show up at my husband’s family’s garage. All of my in-laws are there working on stuff my dad is there too and helps K, R, G, Y and I work on my car. Then my moms whole side of the family comes to the garage to hang out (40ish people) then I woke up. 


IRL CONTEXT
I have not talked to these people in well over a decade, not even on social media. My marriage is healthy and supportive. My husband is very attentive, does everything and more a good husband should. I never talked to G, not even in school. K and I went on a few dates IRL, nothing serious, but he was my first ever “date”.” He later ghosted me and it broke my heart. Y bullied me, especially about K. R and I actually were kinda/sorta friendly in class together.",2023-02-02 04:33:33,1583,True
392,Dreams,"Weird series of dreams I had, Zack and Cody in a horse costume in class, cooking tacos in the microwave, and forced into the back of a classroom with a microphone recording me despite needing to be absolutely quiet.","They were vivid (kind of?) like when I had COVID, and I have been experiencing COVID symptoms for the past few days, even though I already had it AT LEAST TWICE……

I mention that because it seems like when I’ve gotten sick, I had stranger, more noticeable than usual dreams. And I virtually never got sick until **** COVID was unleashed upon the world, which obviously destroyed my golden immune system.

So, first dream I remember:

**Zack and Cody in class**

Now I think they were supposed to be the actual Dylan and Cole Sprouse, as kids, and I was one of them (I’m NEVER anyone but myself in my dreams!) and we were in some kind of, horse costume? But our heads and upper bodies were uncovered, and we were still sitting horizontally next to each other.

I was trying to get to the page the teacher told us to, and being a dream, it was all mixed up nonsense, the page numbers were like, “L5”, “LV”, “XV”? And not even in alphabetical order. The other twin (unsure which was me and which was the other) quickly scrolled to the correct page for me, as the entire class was mad and impatient at me taking so long to find the right page (I think I was supposed to read it out loud). 

I opened the drawer under the desk, and there was like, somehow a mini hallway further then the length of the desk, filled with blocks, of, I assume maybe cheese or crackers? And spider webs. I JUST BARELY remember there MAYBE being a mouse running down the drawer hallway.

**Cooking tacos in the microwave at work**

I work in a grocery store in real life. I was there, and so was my mom, grandmother, and other family members. I was supposed to cook tacos for dinner, except they were premade with shredded cheese and lettuce (which certainly isn’t supposed to be cooked) and I was supposed to cook them SPECIFICALLY IN A MICROWAVE. They were surprisingly only SLIGHTLY soggy, because like the hallway in the drawer, dream laws of physics………

**Being forced into the back of another classroom (different from the first dream) and recorded despite needing to be completely absolutely quiet**

I’ve actually had A LOT of going back to school dreams pretty much since graduating high school, usually I’m still my real life current age (now 27) and it’s the teachers and principal acknowledge that I graduated, but for some reason I’m supposed to continue 12th grade anyway, which makes no sense when taken literally (it’s not college or otherwise CONTINUING education).

In THIS dream, the teacher instructs me to go to the very back (I got the sense this was college, which I’ve actually only taken one semester in real life) of the class. Like that Spongebob episode where Misses Puff sends SpongeBob to the very back of the class for being blamed for Patrick’s “big **** meanie” drawing of her. It’s visually exaggerated how far back he is.

In my dream, there was actually a wall physically separating the main room, and I could barely hear anything. For some reason, we were also sitting on those grocery cart scooters that are SUPPOSED to be for handicap people (in real life kids and even adults use them out of laziness or goofing around, perhaps to make TikToks, or just to be lazy).

But we were specifically supposed to sit on them, in class, for no clear reason.

They also had microphones on them, and when I made a comment that it was dumb to have microphones on them (specifically because it was booming loud for the rest of the class to hear) everyone looked at me and told me to shut the **** up. What a **** feature/requirement. 

I then blew in it to test how sensitive it was. Everyone immediately turned to me again “SHUT THE **** UP!!!!!” 

I then picked up my **** and walked out announcing this was ridiculous and I would not deal with this ****.

In a massive hallway, with a yellow tent (not tint) roof, or something? I yelled “UH-OH” in a mocking manner. I then had the dumb urge to yell even louder, probably waking up in real life, but I fought, realizing it was just my OCD.

What a strange realm. I wonder what bizarre **** I’ll experience tonight!",2023-02-02 04:17:43,4066,True
393,Dreams,Strangled a coyote or wolf that was stalking me,"Well... This was a fun dream...

I was sitting in my car waiting on a friend. I noticed a wild dog like animal walking around the car. This thing looked hungry. I tried calling my friend to warn them but they wouldn't answer. I had to do something otherwise my friend would be attacked.

I got out of the car and had it follow me into a nearby lit garage. It followed me inside and began to circle around me. Growling and drooling. 

Then I jumped on it and knocked it off it's feet. I wrapped my hands around its neck and squeezed tightly. It was fighting hard to get away but with every minute, it was getting weaker and weaker. 

After a few minutes of that, it threw up on the floor of the garage. Fighting for a breath. Then another minute or so went by and it vomited again. Getting weaker and weaker it got easier and easier to continue choking the life out of it.

 My friend found me and saw me fighting this wild animal.

The animal threw up a couple more times in a matter of a couple minutes and then stopped fighting all together. It was lifeless lying on the garage floor. My friend helped me drag it out of the garage outside onto the driveway.

Then I called the police. My friend had watched me **** this wild beast with my 2 hands. 

Now, at 4:15AM... I get to try and go back to sleep......

It was weird because I saw the animal as clearly as day in the dream. But I couldn't tell you who the friend was that was in the garage with me. I couldn't even describe to you what they looked like. But I knew that person. 

I don't know what it's called but I was seriously focused on just the animal I was dealing with at the time. The reason I was there was not important to the dream. Even though that was the reason I was there in the first place... 

Weird...

I don't know what this dream means but I hope it doesn't mean I want to do something weird. Those usually don't make any sense...",2023-02-02 04:17:23,1908,True

I have no idea if it's completely random or actually has any kind of meaning but I've been thinking about it a lot because my dream told me with text and narration and everything (and I NEVER have dreams like this) that ""On February 7th, 2023..."" and it said something will happen and I can't remember that part unfortunately but it possibly had something to do with me being drugged by some stranger because it came up after that, so ok, I don't have to go out on that day in case it actually has any meaning, but the really concerning one, and I've been debating whether to post this or not because I don't want to be blamed if people freak out, but the date is really close now so I wanna talk about it, is in the same dream, 6 days later, I was hanging out with some guy at the beach in Seattle and then the water starting shaking a lot and I was like oh no and went to the top of this hill that was really far away (Ik I would never get there in time irl lol) and I could see the whole city from it and heard glass shattering and metal creaking and then my dream put up the same kind of text and had narration again and said ""On February 13th, 2023 and earthquake will hit Seattle"". And then the REALLY weird part is then later in my dreamed I dreamed everything before that was a dream within that dream and then I was sitting next to someone on this bus and telling him about that and how it was so crazy that I had this prediction dream and then he looks at me and tilts his head down to look at me over his sunglasses and says something like ""how do you know you're not dreaming now?"" And then I woke up. Well I heard recently that there is increasing seismic activity and I was like NO WAY. I reallyyyyy hope nothing that bad actually happens. Just had to get this out since the dates are so close and I heard about that yesterday. But I just wanna put a disclaimer that it could all just be a weird dream and I really don't want people to be doing anything irrational and blaming me cuz that's why I didn't wanna post this months ago.

396,Dreams,My super weird dream from last night,"
Let me tell you about the dream I had last night. Mind you, I have no knowledge of these kinds of things whatsoever, but the dream was just so detailed I felt like I have to share. So if anybody knows what it means let me know please. 
So the dream started with me getting an email: I won a trip to a kid’s camp. Photos of the place in the email, looked super fun with a big lake and activities. The email also cintained super detailed info about how to find the leader. I had to drive in the premises, passing through small buildings, trees in the garden, statues etc. I had to look for a curved wall, and behind that was the enterence. But when I actually got there, I couldn’t find this curved wall. I was going up and down looking for it, when I found a cute little angelic faced girl. She was very sad, sobbing a little. When i asked her what was wrong, she ran away. I wanted to follow her, but then a middle aged, slovenly (dirty hair, not the best skin or teeth) quite chubby woman appeared and stopped me. She introduced he as the leader of the place and said she was waiting for me. She started the tour, showing me around. When we got to the office. I looked at the pictures of the shelves and on those recognized the little girl I saw in the garden earlier. I asked who that was, and the woman said it was her daughter, and she and her lived there in the camp permanently. She wanted to introduce us so we started to look for the little girl, but we could find her for a long time. When we did, there was a crowd of mothers and children around the table where she was hiding. One of the moms in the crowd stepped forward, grabbed the leader’s hair very agressively, and said they all know that she hurts and harasses the little beautiful girl and that it is enough, they are taking action. 
Next thing I know is that i am taking the little sad girl home, just until child services can find her a good home. Someone had to take her until than, and, you know, she was sweet and i fent sorry for her so I wasn’t too pressed about them kindof asking me to take her because I look like a nice person. 
So when we arrived home I put the sleeping girl in my room, i wanted to let her rest. After a while i went to check on her, and when i opened my room’s door, i couldn’t believe my eyes. My whole desk was gone, my bin was gone, my pillows were on the top of the chandelier in a way they should have fallen. The little girl look grotesque, huge eyes and thick eyebrows and fangs. She was looking up at me with a devilish smile. I had to go to the forest to look for my stuff. I found a cave in which grew a lot of plants i’ve never seen before. Unrecognizable creatures told me i needed to solve a riddle to get my stuff back and they couldn’t help me to get rid of the creaure in home, I needed to find it out on my own.
Than I woke up. This dream freak me out somuch and the fact that it was so vivid and detailed makes me feel like it means something. Any thoughts?",2023-02-02 03:01:28,2976,True
397,Dreams,I can't get over this dream,"I remember a long time ago I heard a story about a guy that dreamed almost his hole life and then woke up to find any of it was real and got depressed over the loss of his dream family. I don't know if it's real but something similar happened to me, only I didn't dream a hole life, it felt more like months.

I was me but younger and had a different family, I didn't knew any of them in real life. What amazes me is that it felt very complex. I had memories inside of the dream. I didn't experience each day, it was more like a movie where times passes but you don't see all of it but know it happened, and the feelings where there. I loved my family like I knew them all my life, I even remember we where on vacation and was excited all the way back home because I wanted to see a friend but didn't wanted my family to notice. Every emotion had a lot of detail, it felt very real.

I've tried to come back to that dream but I haven't been able too. I kind of miss everyone, I wish I could see them again. I have dreamed I'm looking for them but never find them. I'm hoping writing about it may give a signal to my brain and bring them back. It would be so cool to have an entirely different life when I go to sleep.

Try to pry your eyes open in the dreams works sometimes but is kinda hard for it to work, sounds weird but idk if it is like this for you guys when ever i touch my eyes in my dreams they feel closed like they are able to be opened.  


try to fall asleep in the dream, this one always works for me all i do is find a place to sleep in the dream, usually just the floor. lay down curl up and close my eyes like im falling asleep and mostly every time i wake up. also when ever something is chasing me or hunting me down in a nightmare i also do this and i wake up pretty fast.

But static universal background that watched me as I drive a bus through its space. So the question is are their currently any catalogues of dream entities and or have any of you experienced any that stick out that you have personally experienced?",2023-02-02 01:44:15,744,True
407,Dreams,Vivid Dreams for 2 months,"Not much has changed in my life, nothing extraordinary anyways but constantly for the past 2 months, I’ve been having very vivid dreams. Almost every night. Sometimes more than 2  such dreams a night. It started somewhere mid-December. Some of these dreams have been extremely terrifying. Last night is the reason I’m posting this here. I dreamt of some kind of extraterrestrial beings chasing me down for 36 days (the fact that I remember this detail from the dream is odd in itself). It ended in a very disturbing way. I’m not gonna post the dream details here because all I’m seeking are some answers. I’m not someone who gets afraid easily but these dreams have really shaken me up. For the first time in my life, I got myself some sleep-aids hoping it will help.

408,Dreams,Creepy Woman in The Woods (1/3),"I've had about 3 dreams were that lady or the place she is probably connected to appears. This first one i'll be talking about is where she had the biggest influence and ended up terrifying me forever. I'm used to walking in the middle of the pure darkness (its a strange hobby, yeah) but as soon as i remember about her, i immediately avoid staying in the dark.  


Dream 1:  We just wanted to play.  
It was probably midnight, Me and my Brother were playing ps2 at our house, there was no one else home and our room only had the tv as a source of light. At some point, i suggested playing GTA San Andreas and i got pretty excited. I sayed something like ""Oh this game has lots of easter eggs! I have and ideia to make you interested in the game, im going to download a few archives from it and then show to you!"" It seemed like i had learned how to download pngs and jpegs from a game, so i put a pendrive in the ps2 and started downloading contents. Later, i took the pendrive to my computer and opened it, i immediately pressed ctrl+a and then somehow put all the images on my phone. It was taking pretty long for the archives to finish transferring to my phone, so i started looking into the images. One image in specific caught my attention, it was the image of a woman in a white dress, covered in what seemed to be blood in the middle of a forest during the night. I could barely see the woman because the blue rays of the moon were shining pretty intensely on the photo. So after downloading all of the images into my phone, i immediately try to show that image to my Brother, an attempt of which i was unsuccesful. The photo was gone. My vision faded to blueish-black and then i read the following words ""That night, the two brothers died within seconds."" with that image of the woman slowly appearing until i woke up.  


The worst part of this nightmare was when i woke up.  
I, for some **** reason, decided to mock the nightmare.  
I stupidly sayed to myself ""No one dies that fast, **** silly dream"" like some **** movie cliché.  
I didn't expect to be responded.  
I heard an extremely deep voice INSIDE my head say ""Wanna bet?"".  
My soul started leaving my body for about 10-15 seconds like something was trying to **** me, until i covered myself with my blankets and kept saying ""I can die pretty fast, i can die pretty fast, we all die pretty fast"" until the sun started shining again.

It was night time my mom,brother and I had just got home from school. It was pitch black except the orange lights coming from our porch. I look to my right and look at the outline of some trees. When I see the eyes of a owl. It’s eyes were glowing switching from a dark red to a bright yellow. Suddenly the eyes disappeared and I asked my mom if she saw it. I look down and it’s walking up to me. My mother says “poor thing someone cut its wings off” I was confused and I looked closer. It’s wings were cut off to I touch them and the owl let me they were just cut off at the second joint. Then I hear my brother call my name and I wake up. This happened a few days ago and usually I forget my dreams sometimes but this one stuck out. Not sure what it means but I would like if someone could possibly interpret this.

414,Dreams,Bizarre dream about actually dying,"So let my preface this by saying I don’t dream often but when I do, it’s usually very vivid. I’ve been having strange dreams the past couple of nights which is fairly unusual for me. I’ve had dreams about dying in the past but I usually wake up right at the very end before it actually happens. Two nights ago I had one where I was crushed in an avalanche and right at the moment of impact, instead of waking up, it felt like I blacked out but was still somewhat conscious in a weird way (hard to describe). When I did actually wake up, my ears were ringing and I had a gnarly headache for about a minute. It was very distressing for several additional minutes but then I felt totally fine until I went back to sleep. This exact same thing has happened to me once before a few years ago, but instead of being crushed by an avalanche it was getting hit by a train. Another interesting side note, when I woke up again later for work, instead of feeling bummed out I was actually in a great mood. I remember also being in a great mood after the first time this happened to me. Has anyone else had a similar experience?

I was with another person, travelling across an endless desert that spanned in all directions. I knew where we were heading was dangerous, but it was necessary and the only way to go for safety, so we pressed on tracing footprints in the shifting grains. 

A large dune laid ahead of us which we struggled to overcome, and once on top kept heading to our destination. I went ahead first since I had more energy, but felt the ground begin to rumble. Whipping my head back around behind me, I stand frozen as something begins to emerge from beneath the sand. 

A large hand with three extra fingers and part of its wrist stretch out into the air and swipe moving towards me. I scream and begin to run away, hoping I can get away in time.

We're in our 20s now and having our own lives but we chat every once in a while.

He eventually got a gf but I think they recently broke up.

Anyways, I had a weird dream last night where we were in a hotel room just chatting, catching up, teasing but also cuddling. I distinctly remember resting on his chest.

There were other sensual things we were doing but I can't remember all the details. I just know we were teasing each other over having weird **** crushes on each other for **** knows how long.

One is that I keep dreaming about going to the Grand-reopening of Toysrus. I loved that place as a kid and spent countless hours browsing through the stores seeing all the toys as a kid, and it broke my heart to see that they went bankrupt and closed all of their stores here in the U.S. My guess is because I had a big childhood attachment to that store that I still think about it subconsciously. Another place I keep seeing in my dreams is the Lego store, specifically the one located in Downtown Disney at Disneyland resort, I think this one is just because I really liked that place when I went there and wish I could go again.",2023-02-01 20:22:25,774,True

425,Dreams,Having nightmares about non-scary things that I can't wake up from.,"Hope this is appropriate to post here. Never used this sub before but I'm kind of desperate. 

Lately I've been having a dream about once a week where I'm doing something completely harmless and unfrightening, but while I'm in the dream it *feels* like a nightmare. I'll wake up and rationally confirm I had no reason to feel afraid, but while I'm in the dream it feels as bad as any real nightmare I've ever had. 

At first it was just sort of a weird occurrence I didn't think too much about, but the past few times it happened I've also been feeling trapped in the dream. Normally if I have a nightmare I just wake up and be able to move on without issue, but these dreams I've been ""stuck"" and unable to wake up for what feels like days or weeks, even though when I do finally wake up it's usually only been ~2 hours since I went to sleep. 

Additionally, I've noticed when these dreams happen, once I wake up I have to take a couple minutes to ground myself in reality and fully confirm that was a dream and didn't actually happen. If I don't do this, I tend to go back to sleep and just immediately have the same dream again. 

Some examples of what these non-nightmares have been about: washing my hands, baking cookies, doing push-ups. There's no catch or anything, it's really just a dream about those simple activities that somehow registers as a horrible nightmare in my brain. 

It's starting to take a real toll on my sleep. Has anyone had something like this happen before? Is there anything I can do to stop it? I haven't changed my diet or sleep schedule or anything like that lately so I don't know what might've started this trend.",2023-02-01 18:59:50,1649,True

After some time a giant rock flew from the sky onto the city 1-2 km away from us and a few seconds later the force from the impact hit us killing us imediatley. In the few seconds I just thought that I don't want to die, but was also somewhat excited about what might come after death. There was no pain, no nothing. The dream didn't end there, I got reincarnated into the population after the meteorite hit earth. There weren't many people left.

I'm too young at this point to actually, realistically have kids, but I dunno. I miss her. her name was Daisy. :(

432,Dreams,"Dreaming of being attacked, kidnapped, and escaping.","So, I literally just woke up from a dream where I was at work taking out the trash when I was suddenly ambushed by two dogs. I had my car running and I was ready to go after taking out the trash, but the dogs jumped and bit me so hard I fell to the ground. It's also fair to mention that I literally got off of work at like 1am so Im not sure if that has something to do with it. After that, a man was hiding in a small metal storage closet. I was so angry in the dream that I grabbed a pen and started stabbing him in the face. However, when I did, more people started coming out of nowhere and tried to attack me and they succeeded in holding me down. 

Now, being held on the ground I saw another random man being attacked as well while taking out the trash and there were like 15 kidnappers trying to get the both of us. I'm not sure how, but I managed to fight them of like I was some sort of karate fighter which I am not. I don't know how to fight at all. I also kept stabbing these people in the eyes and at one point I took someones eye out of their socket which was so scary because I didn't want to do it in the dream, but I had to. The feelings I experienced were being afraid, angry, but at the same time, being compassionate because I didn't want to hurt them I just wanted to go home after work. They also taunted me a lot, but I took advantage of that and managed to flee through a back door. In the dream, I managed to take control of what was happening which was weird because mostly my dreams consist of me being a spectator. However, in these dreams I was able to be in two places at once: in a car driving away from the kidnappers and at the back entrance which led into a parking lot where the kidnappers apparently had guns now and were shooting at anything they saw. 

Eventually, I was able to drive away and disguise myself with a hat and a mask? Which to me seems so **** but I guess that worked in the dream. However, it does get blurry what happened, but I killed one of the kidnappers in the dream with the help of another man. We buried him in his front yard and covered the area with red plants and roses. I'm not sure how it happened, but with the help of the man, we killed a lot of the kidnappers. Looking back at it, it did feel like a movie of some sorts but it felt so real. I'm just curious what it all means if it means anything at all. I don't want to be attacked or assaulted while at work.

433,Dreams,I just had a nightmare of being a serial killer.,"This is kind of **** up for me. I have been pretty indulged in gore content for many years because of morbid curiosity and somehow, for some reason, i feel a certain amount of my stress is relieved from watching it. And sometimes, when i am actually awake, i think of doing acts of violence against other people. It could be my family, relatives, friends or strangers. 

Just a few minutes ago, i freaking woke up because i had a dream of being a serial killer. I remember coming home, feeling really angry for a reason i can't remember. So, when I got home, I just slowly went inside the premises. I didn't inform anyone that I was home. And i just took the kitchen knife.
At first, I slowly went to my parents'room. 
There I saw my dad laying down on his stomach, looking at his phone. And then I just suddenly slit his throat, and then held his head, then slit it again and again till he was beheaded. And to my surprise, I didn't feel a **** remorse when I did it.
And the next thing I did was, I was planning who to **** next. My mother or my uncle that is living with us. And then I suddenly felt remorse. I felt a feeling that, this is NOT me. I reminded myself that I am not a serial killer. I reminded myself that I am a human being. And when I realized I had committed ****, I said to myself. This must be a dream.

436,Dreams,Strange patterns in my dreams.,"Growing up, I used to dream very normal, average dreams. Some crazy stuff would happen, sometimes I’d remember, sometimes I wouldn’t. That was the end of it. 


Around my sophomore year of high school I had this dream that I went to Milwaukee with my mom and was riding these Rinky **** subway cars around and ever since then my dreams have been building this world. 
Now I remember everything. Everything. There’s so many hundreds of places in my dreams. There’s several cities that are what I view as interpretations of real life cities. 


I have a life in my dreams. It’s like when I close my eyes in real life I open them in my dream life. I have relationships in my dreams. Sometimes, often, I look forward to falling asleep because my dream world is so vivid and real. 

I could go on for hours and hours in detail about my dreams. 

One of the places I visit in my dreams the most is the bunker. It’s in this basement hallway of a building used in my dreams as an oversized group cabin that I’ll end up goin to with large groups of people. It’s a big steel door with faded red paint and opening it leads down into this deep dark cement bunker. I am the only one who knows about the bunker. 


The absolute craziest thing I can remember was going to a restaurant I frequent in my dreams with the usual group of people. There were people there that hadn’t been there before and me and my group had to convince these people I’d been there before in previous dreams.

439,Dreams,I had a dream I died but it felt like it had something to do with quantum physics/ theory of quantum immortality,"A few nights ago I had what felt like the most scariest experience in my entire life. I woke up crying from how intense it felt.

In my dream, I was driving alone in my car on a highway I’ve driven on before. At this point I become half conscious (I’m able to think but unable to control what is going on). 

As I’m driving, I start to lose control of my car &amp; I remember thinking “Oh no! Why is this happening?” And I became incredibly scared because I’m starting to drive into a group of people stranded on the side of the highway. I remember hitting them &amp; clearly seeing a woman go flying after she hit my windshield. 

After I hit the group of people, I’m full on looking at the wall of the highway. I clearly remember the feeling and how terrified I was &amp; I had a quick thought about a the theory of quantum immortality.

To break it down, (and please correct me if I’m wrong) Quantum Theory is basically modern physics ‘explaining the nature and behavior of matter and energy on the atomic and subatomic level’

The theory of quantum immortality/ quantum suicide is if you were to be put in a life or death situation and your consciousness is certain you won’t die, your consciousness , your perspective, wouldn’t die. This theory obviously has some arguments to disprove but it’s just a theory.

Now back to the dream, as I’m staring at the wall I confidently thought “I won’t die I won’t die” and I hit the wall. As I go forward, I begin walking and the setting changes to my moms house. I was scared and frantically looking for her so she could comfort me from what felt like a near death experience. I walk in the backyard &amp; see a friend of mine in a hard hat with a crew doing construction. I was relived to see a familiar face &amp; asked where my mom was and he was smiling and just said she was at my aunts. 


As I walked inside from my moms backyard, I was immediately inside my aunts house and it looked like a family party was going on. I finally found my mom and she was with my sister. They were smiling and happy to see me and I began crying and hyperventilating and yelling “I almost died! I almost died!” And they gave me a very odd look and I turned away from them and woke up.

It sounds like a long dream but it all felt very fast. The feeling was so intense like I said, I woke up crying lol. I’m a firm believer in dreams have meanings but I’m not too sure what this means if someone knows anything.",2023-02-01 14:26:47,2444,True

Sometimes my grandmothers house, which I also spent a lot of my childhood in. But both times the houses are…bigger. Emptier. And filled with nasty things. Bears, giant spiders, mystery blobs and monster and tangles of muscle and hate that I can’t identify. Every time I run for my guns but I can’t find them. I have a Dragunov SVD, an AR-9mm, a sig-p365, and a S&amp;W .45 usually in my dreams. Sometimes a Saiga-12 clone. Can’t find any of them in the dream. Search the whole house. Every time. My room, the living room, the gun safe. I have some level of lucidity and I check a different place for my guns every time. **** I even checked the pantry one cycle. Nowhere. Sometimes I’ll find a lone bullet, or a magazine but no gun. Once I found the bayonet to the SVD, and that helped against the spiders, but something else got us. The dream always ends the same way. One of the family dies or gets hurt. My mother, a giant spider. My stepfather, the blob. My grandmother, fell in a pit in the tunnels. My brother, the bear.

442,Dreams,Meaning of a series of bad dreams?,"I've been having bad dreams, not nightmares, but just genuinely bad dreams. Last night I had a series of dreams that left me speechless. 

The first part of my dream started off in a batcave like lair. I was being hunted by enhanced individuals for a reason unknown to me. I don't remember much of it because of what followed.

The next thing I know, I'm in my hometown...but it's not my hometown. It was so familiar yet so foreign. I was at a house party and all of a sudden 2 houses across the street blew up in flames. I remember the terror and screaming of everyone there. I started driving then I ended up in a parking garage. I came face to face with the guy who blew up the houses but he didn't see me. I didn't know him. Tall man, brown hair driving a blue SUV. I was able to get away

I got into my car and started driving but didn't know where I was going. I ended up in the mall getting ice cream but I didn't have shoes on. My sister was with me. After the ice cream I drove us home. But as I was driving, I was going too fast around a bend on the highway going really fast. I ended up going off the road and hit a bunch of trees then I woke up. 

After not sleeping after that, I finally fell back asleep. This time I just spawned on a beach with my cousin but it was so beach I've ever been to. I could feel the heat of the sun of my skin and the sand on my feet. I went on the boardwalk alone to get sunscreen and other things bc I didn't have anything with me, I just appeared there. After aimlessly walking the boardwalk alone with no luck of finding sunscreen, I enter a ""mall"" of shops on the boardwalk. This time an active shooter appeared and started chasing me even though I wasn't the target. The same man who blew up the houses. I eventually got away and met with my cousin where we got pizza then I woke up. 

I'm so confused why I had all these bad dreams in one night. It was absolutely terrifying that every dream had a bad outcome. Has anyone had dreams like this? What do they mean? My biggest concerns are the being hunted down, the explosive fires with screams, the lethal car crash, and being chased by an active shooter",2023-02-01 14:01:40,2153,True

444,Dreams,Weird experiences lucid dreaming?,"So this is my boyfriend's experience but I am so fascinated by it so I had to share. When he was younger (maybe middle school age) he would have nightmares often and learned how it get out of them by lucid dreaming. He didn't even know what that was at the time but instead of waking himself up he had complete control over his dream. He said he would literally wipe the dream so that everything is just white and blank and create whatever he wanted to dream about and he did this pretty often. However, at some point, if he was adding and changing too much stuff, an old man would come up to him and tell him that's enough and he's reached his limit. After that, he couldn't change the dreams at all and if he woke up and fell back asleep, he couldn't lucid dream in the same night. This man came often and it was the same man every time.

445,Dreams,Terrible dream I just need to get it off my chest,"Not sure if this is where the dream started or not but I woke up from a coma and had had a bad accident. I was physically ok but I don't know what happened exactly and it was very traumatic. I was in a coma for only 2 days but I learned upon waking that my dad had died. In this dream, my parents had never divorced and I think I was closer with my dad although we are pretty close in real life still. My mom said he was so upset by my incident and he believed that i was not going to live that he crashed his car into something and we weren't sure if it was an accident or not. I didn't process this very well and a few days later went to some kind of party for my boyfriend's friend. I ended up having to leave early and drove home alone and a song came on that was SO heartbreaking I can't even explain how hurt I felt listening to that song and everything with my dad hot me while I was driving. I was sobbing until I ended up in this big dark pool. I had been there with my dad as a child and I was watching myself as a child trying to jump in while my dad encouraged me from below. I knew that I had to step into myself and experience this moment again but I wasn't sure of I was ready. Eventually I gathered the courage and I became young me. I was scared to jump in the pool but I did it and when I went into the water, I saw a door at the bottom. I opened it and I can't remember what was behind the door but I was crying when I came back out. I did it over and over again and there was something different behind the door each time but I can't remember what and I was crying more and more the more I went in. Finally I left the door and I was sobbing harder than I ever have in real life but I was under water and couldn't breathe so I came to the top and that's when I woke up.

446,Dreams,Weird dream about fiancé and grandma," Background:


I was raised by my grandma and she has always been very important to me. Unfortunately, she passed right before I graduated high school so she never got to meet my fiancé (Jeff for the dream summary). I met Jeff in college, we’ve been together 4 years and are getting married next year. He’s amazing and I love him. 


When I was 9 I met my childhood friend Carl. Carl was a year or two older than me but we played together up until I moved when I was 15. My grandma did know him and I think she sometimes wondered if we’d be together. I still talk to Carl occasionally (like twice a year and that’s it) but we were never involved and never dated. He still misses my grandma too. 


Dream summary 
So I had a dream my grandma was watching me and my cousins, but instead my parents house or my uncles house we were in a bigger version of my college apartment. Someone comes to the door and everyone greets the person and calls them Carl even though when I looked at them it was clearly Jeff. They do have similar hair and a similar build but it was clearly Jeff’s face. 


We all went for a walk and Carl/Jeff told me he liked me. When we got back we go into my bedroom and he tries to kiss me but I stopped him and say “I’m getting married I can’t.” He says he understands and stays by me for the rest of the dream but in my head I was confused because I couldn’t remember who I was getting married to. In my dream I could remember an ex, and this friend Carl but I couldn’t remember that I was marrying Jeff. 


I brush it off in the dream without saying anything and I ask my grandma if she ever used cloth diapers for her kids. In real life, I was researching cloth diapers for babies a few days ago out of curiosity. She told me to ask my aunt. 


I was wondering what this might mean? I’m hoping it’s my grandma saying she likes Jeff and my brain was using Carl because my grandma was never around Jeff.",2023-02-01 13:37:49,1923,True

450,Dreams,Meteors/asteroids,"Just woke up from a dream where I was separated from
My wife and meteoroid/asteroids began to fall to earth. 

Some backstory, I live states away from my hometown with my wife and her family. I’m from a midwestern state and sometimes visit for a couple weeks at a time to see family. 

Dream:
I was at my grandmothers house visiting. I was here often as a kid; It’s where I met my good friends that I had throughout school(they lived just down the road). In this dream meteors begin to fall, you can see their smoke trail as they fall through the ceiling. Im now in the garage and I walk out and look up/behind the garage and see bigger rocks being broken up in the sky. Highly detailed as you see their bigger smoke trail and then also see “explosions” as they break up and fiery pieces continue down to earth. 

I then see a mushroom cloud off in the distance. I know this is from a bigger piece that actually hit the ground. I say “brace for impact” to those around me and we all turn our back and hit the ground, plugging our Ears, as the shock wave over takes us. Another mushroom cloud appears and we do this again. Very detailed as I remember feeling the pressure wave fall over us and the accompanying wind.

After this happens I notice a car in the drive way and it’s 2 of my childhood friends and one unidentified person with them. One says “yea we came to see you” and I ask the other who is driving the car “it’s just rocks, right?”(he was in the military so it’s as if I’m asking him for clarification—these are thoughts that went through my head in the dream).

I walk away and call my wife and she’s acting normal, as if nothing happened in her area.

451,Dreams,Hyper realistic dream of killing a large snake and then a large orb-weaver spider that could jump.,"The snake wasn’t a real snake, it was closest to a rat snake but a lot thicker and more aggressive. The spider was a fist sized yellow orb-weaver. I have a really bad fear of spiders. I ended up killing the snake after wrestling around with it, and a little later the spider showed up. It kept trying to jump on me but after a few failed attempts I killed it as well.

From my understanding, killing a snake can signify triumph over something stressful, or beating an addiction. I’m coming up on a year of sobriety, but it hasn’t been much of a struggle to be frank. I had a problem a few months ago where a friend showed their true colors and proved they were anything but a friend. It’s been itching my mind here-and-there but I’m finally able to get past it. So I think that might be what’s behind me killing the snake. But I don’t know what the spider could’ve been about, any ideas?",2023-02-01 13:01:51,887,True

1. **OK Reddit**  
**Do you remember this movie called Slumberland that’s on Netflix well I’ve recently noticed that my dreams are kind of like what they go through, running through different genres of dreams and being changed by nightmares.**  
**My dreams have been like that, depending on how much I remember that morning, I can remember from 1 to 5 different sections of my dreams  The dream I had tonight had about 4 to 5 different sections. I can't remember too much about wat happened first, but this is what I can remember.** 
2. **It first starts with my mom waking me up, we were in the cabinet next to a river and I was helping our cat and also the lizard I think It was trying to help them. My whole family was there in the Cabin and we were getting some really old mattresses out, and they wore really ancient mattress that you do not want to be sleeping on, but after that we had some books that we were going to go donate to a lady I want to donate them to her but she took one and runed away, so I went caught up with her where she was in a really shallow end of the library and I was giving the book back to her and she said she was going to come back for the other one, because she can only do one at a time so we took the other one and put it away and then when I went back out.**
3. **But I was in a different area I was in another person‘s driveway his car was even there, and he had a little kid that had no hands and was a toy. he buried the kid into the ground and replaced its head with a pumpkin and the small child would carve the pumpkin into a really cute looking pumpkin head the guy would continue to do this to the small child then I ran to the house and fell into the sewers I think, well swimming through it I found parts of bodies zombies infected. I found this one girl who was pregnant she was a Chinese cultured lady she was tied up and drowning with 'things' that were trying to get into her private areas, I freed her, and she went on her merry way and left I went back up and out of the sewers.**
4. **I then found myself in the center of an operation in NCIS where special agent Gibbs was directing the team. They were doing something, but I think they were trying to stop the zombie apocalypse which they failed because the zombies got into their operation started eating them. Special Agent Gibbs got the worst of it sadly, I ran out of there were the small child toy was laughing at us. they still had a carved pumpkin for their head.** 
5. **When I ran out, I found myself at a very large building with a big statue in front of it, and the statue was of a little lolly girl big pigtails blue dress and I think, she would’ve had a leak in her hand, but she didn’t. I was a different little lolly with also pigtails more like space buns, with a pink dress and a water gun, we kind of played like Splatoon on the area until the shops opened up I was suddenly helping the shopkeepers keep their shop in order they even ask me to do /time set day to make sure the zombies won’t get in. I constantly made them check their sewers and stuff to make sure that zombie parts won’t come up.**
6.  **Eventually I found some cosplayers, cosplaying Scooby Doo characters I went and joined them because I was also dressed up like Fred and I found another guy that was dressed up like Fred, I was like “hey Fred how you doing” I wanted to hang with him for a while and then Daphne came over and sat in between us and I was like “what’s the big deal here I’m trying to hang out with Fred” and they took it the wrong way. they ware thinking I was trying to go on a date with him, which is wrong I did not want to go on a date with him, I just wanted to hang out with him. And then he made a rude comment saying Fred and Velma are siblings which is wrong they’re not siblings and then I was in a cosplay outfit of Velma now.** 
7. **Then there was a scream and a commotion, someone got bit by a zombie everyone started panicking and running around, zombie tried to come after me and Fred we fled to the neighboring shop which was like Beardos and pizza I think, and they made pastries pizza we went in there and tried to hide from the zombies and for some reason the zombies were only trying to come after us.** ( Also sidenote on the zombies they **weren’t** like Minecraft zombies they were like Zombieland zombies from like the live action movies stuff they were realistic.) **Both me and Fred and the zombies made pizzas and pastries. on our way out I suddenly was Scooby Doo I ran into a cabinet well Fred ran out the door and I was trying to do like a makeup tutorial thingy. like I was trying to suddenly become look like something else I made a picture that was my face and then painted over it and the zombie got distracted by it for some reason. I ran out side and then ran back inside ware it was gone.**
8. **I went back and made myself another pastry because those things were delicious but I was poor and didn’t have any money so then someone tried ordering some French toast and the baker asked what kind of Dow with that and they couldn’t remember but it was a water resistant dow and for some reason I knew that, I told them and they were like oh yeah it’s only I was helping them or something I don’t know that’s when I woke up from the dream and darn zombies always chasing me**",2023-02-01 12:18:15,5326,True

In the dream though I’m his granddaughter, not Summer but of my own identity. I didn’t really see ‘myself’ but I did have red ginger hair when I’d look down/around in the dream but I was never called Summer so idk. 
Anyways I felt younger as well. And even though it really really really grosses me out to say this, but again gotta vent it because this is odd behavior coming from my own brain…but I’m pretty sure I was 12 in the dream because it was mentioned by another ‘character’. (I’m 24f irl) 
But yeah. In the dream I was **** over my grandpa Rick 😭🗿. Like I was trying to hustle him into situations with me and **** like ****…and the horniness was destroying me because he refused to want to smash.

464,Dreams,Unusually strange dreams,"Long post, hoping a few read it and give advice. 

Background: 24M, Job promotion moved me to another state right after Christmas, 6 hours from home and everyone I know. I love it and I’m so happy to be here, but I am completely alone with no friends other than my long time girlfriend coming to stay on weekends. 
Let me start by saying I’m not typically a feel high stress person, I pride myself in being exposed to tense situations and feel that is where I’m at by best. My girlfriend feels my dreams are because I’m “secretly stressed or scared and also in a new place” but again, I don’t feel stressed or scared. 

My dreams have been feeling so real and just flat out berserk. 
Examples: one dream the mother of my child passed away, and for some reason my daughter was completely unfazed. 
In another dream, I was in a hotel room with my brother and sister in Memphis and for whatever reason hitmen were chasing us. 
In another, I was in the middle of a field fishing with my daughter and had to protect her from an actual robot, on some Megan type **** lol

In the latest dream which has been bothering me the most, something screamed at me telling me to wake up and lock my bedroom door, and when I woke up my bedroom door was wide open. This one is particularly weird because I routinely lock it every night, again I’m in a big nice house, new city and state completely alone, so of course I lock it at night. 

Is this normal? Am I secretly stressed and that’s the cause of them? 
I work a high stress job managing 200+ employees but again, I’m so happy to be at this point in my career. I enjoy my job, I enjoy my life, and I’m the happiest I’ve ever been. I still regularly see both my daughter and girlfriend so not much has changed there either.

I was stuck in a loop of either waking up in sleep paralysis, or waking up into another dream, nearly identical to the previous one. The dream was me waking up in my bed, in my room (indistinguishable from my real one) and there would always be a corpse of someone I know laying next to me, always a different one. The worst part is I was aware that im dreaming because I automatically do the nose breathing technique, but I couldnt figure out how to wake up, and when I did, it was into a 20 second paralysis after which I fell asleep again. It felt like actual days passed, even though I was only asleep for an hour.

468,Dreams,Lucid dreams and recurring person,"Hello dear community,

I'm posting here because I wanted to share something odd that have been happening lately.

I started to lucid dream for the past year. I use to do it in the past, but not as often.

A couple months ago, I had a terrible nightmare and in the middle of it, I saw a famous actor and because I recognize him, I realize that I was dreaming.  I was stuck in a non-stop loop of false awakening and he ""helped"" me wake up for real.

Since then, this actor have become my ""cue"" to know that I'm dreaming. Each time i'm having a dream that is really realistic, I will call his name to see if he appears. Once he appears, I have full control of my dream. Sometimes, he'll stay by my side or he will just acknowledge that I am dreaming and everything is ok.

It happened at least a dozen time in the past months. I feel weird because I work with actors all the time and I don't put people on a pedestal. Also, I have never met that person in real life.

Also, this person is always courteous and helpful in my dream. In one dream, I asked him why he was there, why it was this particular appearance all the time. He said he didn't know and was as confused as me.  

It's kind of neat that I've found a way to trigger my lucid dream, but I feel a bit odd to have this person in my dream more often than say... my husband.",2023-02-01 09:16:46,1331,True
469,Dreams,"Two things, this sub should be exclusively for nightmares, because people's dreams are boring, and here's last night's nightmare...ranking in the top 3 for sure.","Okay so this dream doesn't sound too scary, and it's not very long. But you need to try extremely hard to put yourself in this position. Because it was one of those dreams where there's absolutely no doubt in your mind that what you're experiencing is real. 

So I'm going to explain this as if it really happened, since that's how the experience happened. 

So I'm on a boat with my older brother in the middle of the night. He says something like ""Be quiet, we're not supposed to be here"" I said something like ""Okay!"" Then we hear something coming out of the water. I can't see what it is, other than the fact that it was absolutely massive, a leviathan of some kind, black, and seemingly square shaped. It keeps coming out of the water. Then it keeps coming out of the water. Again, this is all real to you in the moment, so imagine the absolute **** terror seeing this thing come out of the water. Finally after what seemed like forever this thing is out of the water and floating above us, maybe 15 feet. All I felt was my pounding heart and pure, incomprehensible terror as I watched this mystery box fly over our tiny boat in the dead of night. This never happened before, but in my dream I literally fainted, which in turn woke me up. 

Unfortunately the dream ends there so I didn't ""learn"" anything 

I still feel extremely unsettled thinking about it. I know it was just a dream, but I still want to know what that was? In my dream my mind was thinking ""government? Aliens? Government aliens?""",2023-02-01 09:03:38,1505,True

472,Dreams,What Is Happening? Time Skipping?,"I wake up in 10000 BC wearing nothing but a hide loincloth and top. I leave my small hut to find men eating and cooking. They start talking to me but I have no idea what they are even saying.

One of them is holding cooked animal guts and I shake my hands no. They all get angry and yell until I grab and take a bite. They all smile and continue eating. I slowly chew trying my best not to throw up.

After this I see all the men grab spears and leave. While the women play with kids and talk. As I have no clue what they are saying I just take a walk around the village. 

I get grabbed from behind and a man with one hand over my mouth and I knife against my necks starts talking. He moves his hand and I tell him ""please dont **** me"" he looks at me confused.

His confusion changes as he gropes my **** while still holding a knife to my neck. I try to get away but he stabs the knife through my hand before running as men from my village come to recuse me.

They treat my wounds and it becomes dark. Each man grabs a girl to bring to there huts. As man grabs me and when I tell him no he just picks me up and takes me to his tent. He forces himself upon me I try to fight but its no use. After he is done he goes to sleep as I cry all night.

The next day I just quietly eat play with the kids and ignore everything. I noticed its getting dark and the men are grabbing women again. But they are not going to the same huts. Each one has a different partner which means I to have a different partner.

This time instead of an old **** man it's a handsome young man. I decide since this is my life now I should get used to it. After my night of pleasure I wake up to our village being attacked. I see an angry guy throw a spear that goes right throw my chest and I jolt up.

I'm in a old japanese type home on my floor futon. I touch my chest and i have a scar on my chest and hand. A japanese samurai comes to get me and we walk to the cherry blossom tree where he starts talking. Again not understanding I just smile. 

I notice everyone bows or kneels when I walk by as if I was a princess. They treat me with fruits and flowers. I get a massage and enjoy a hot spring bath. While in the hot springs a man comes up to me. He has different colored armor then the people ive seen. He yells and then I'm on the floor. Well my head is as I look at my **** headless body fall into the spring.

Everything goes dark until I wake up in a cell. Im now in the US during the witch trails and I have been considered a witch. They bring me to the noose, **** me, as the crowd throws rocks at me. They ask me to defend myself but they dont even list. They drop me but the rope breaks and I survived. The crowd continues to throw rocks at me as I run.

I continue to run as much as I can. I cannot see through my tears and I keep running. Until I notice I am no longer in the forest. In fact I am at the park near my house totally **** as on lookers laugh shout and take pictures. I run home and I am safe. I notice I still have scars on my hand chest and neck from before. 

The mirror I'm looking in now shows the village from the start. One of the men who survived the attack pulled me through the mirror into the 10000 BC world. I think to myself not again. Before waking up.",2023-02-01 08:54:48,3269,True

480,Dreams,The Wandering Monks,"I just woke up from a dream involving an order of monks, who spend their entire lives not in a cloister, but on a never ending pilgrimage. They constantly walk in lines on exactly determined paths across the land, never breaking pace or marching order, but still they welcome outsiders to walk with them.

They all had bald heads, tan skin from being out under the sun so much, getting progressively darker with age, and wore grey tunics with orange togas on top, making them appear outwardly similar to Buddhist monks, although the dream was set in a mountain town similar to one I knew from Spain.

So I was marching in line with them, together with another outsider. He was one of those extreme outdoorsy globetrotter types: A young white male, late teens or early twenties, with light brown dreadlocks in a ponytail, sparse but wild **** hair, ethno style necklace and bracelets, a messy backpack, t-shirt, cargo shorts and bare feet. He didn't seem to take the spiritual significance of the pilgrimage seriously and generally be the kind of guy who travels just for the experience of traveling. He bragged to me how tough the monks' routes were and that they had to collectively stop their pilgrimage on two occasions already because he couldn't keep up. I was irritated by his attitude and asked if he shouldn't be expected to rather die from exhaustion than interrupting what is sacred to them.

To that, I got an unexpected response: An elderly, heavily tan monk, who was apparently the only one behind us, broke the marching order to walk past and then a circle around me. ""You should ask the Ritual Master about things like this."" he then told me and moved on in front of me.

The Ritual Master was a woman; the only one I noticed among the monks. She was also the only one to wear pants, dressed in all orange and to walk besides the line, accompanied by a man dressed the same except in navy blue, who served as her translator. Sadly I couldn't ask her anything before waking up.

But from the old monk's behavior towards me, I got a feeling that he meant that my way of thinking was an obstacle, although not the kind to simply avoid and walk past, but that one needs to get around as part of the path.",2023-02-01 07:25:47,2215,True
481,Dreams,Seven Swords," 

Hello!

I've been dreaming about having different kinds of swords. It's like I've collected them. None of them had a scabbard. Here are the ones that I remember:

First one was a plastic sword; yellow blade and pink hilt.

Second one was another plastic sword; blue blade and pink hilt.

Third one was a short sword with a curved tip, like the shape of an aries' horn.

Forth one was a katana with a long black blade with green waves painted on.

Fifth one was a normal katana.

Sixth one was the only one that had a scabbard. Looked like a katana, the scabbard was simple but beautiful. Probably made of fine beechwood and the blade was white as bone.

Seventh one was a long sword with a black hilt and a silver blade. This one came to me in another dream with the other ones.

The third, sixth and seventh one were the ones I had much joy wielding. As I wielded the third and the sixth together, shouting out of my lungs and running through the room. And wielding the seventh one with admiration and pride.

I'm personally very fond of swords, there was a shadow sword in my childhood that made me overcome my fear of the dark. But what could this all mean?

I'll be very thankful if someone could interpret it for me.",2023-02-01 07:22:58,1224,True

487,Dreams,Chronicles of my Weirdass Dreams 2: Jungle Gym Politics,"I only recently discovered this sub after a particularly intense dream over the weekend ([I've already posted that one if anyone's interested](https://www.reddit.com/r/Dreams/comments/10ptemc/chronicles_of_my_weirdass_dreams_the_altar_of_fire/) \- warning: it's pretty **** up), and it's nice to finally find a place to share and talk about memorable dreams! I'm prone to experiencing especially vivid, elaborate dreams, and this is one of the earliest dreams I can remember in vivid detail. I think I was 6 when I had this dream, and I must've been visiting Ontario Place that summer. I'm sure there's become a few confabulated spots here and there over the years since I dreamed this, but I wrote a lot of it down a long time ago, which helps.

If anyone would like to take a stab at analyzing the meaning of this and/or the previous dream I posted, by all means, please do!

So I'm at this theme park a lot like the old Ontario Place, when my parents suddenly tell me it's time for me to ""go make a living on my own"" at the ripe old age of six, I guess. So I do what any child would do after being freshly abandoned by her family in the middle of a theme park...I join a gang of kids living in its giant jungle gym! It's one of those huge towering structures with elaborate tunnels, slides, bridges, secret passageways, hidden ""rooms,"" and ball pits (it somewhat resembles the ""H2O Generation Station"" in Ontario Place at the time, but much bigger and more elaborate). This teenage boy named Mickey ran the pack, and the vast majority of other kids were also older than me, so I was relegated to the task of patrolling for intruders from the jungle gym's top level, using a big yellow telescope attached to the railing to look down near the entrance. I did lots of asking ""who goes there?"" to anyone attempting to reach the entrance. If an approacher tried anything suspicious or tried to barge in, I would yell over to the ""shooters"" on the other side of the top level to start firing balls (taken from the ball pits) down on the intruder using these big yellow ball-shooting devices attached to the railings (probably inspired by the Atom Blaster at Ontario Place). Kids even younger than me - called the ""worker bees"" - were the ones tasked with fetching balls down from the first-floor ball pits and bringing them up to the ""shooters"" to load their ball-shooters. Meanwhile the fastest kids in the pack were the ""fetchers,"" who would run to pick up any balls outside before returning to the safety of the jungle gym as fast as possible (I tried out to be a fetcher, since being a fast runner was pretty much my entire personality at that age, but for some reason I could hardly run at all during the ""test"" so I failed).

My closest friend and fellow patroller was a girl named Daphne, who even looked a bit like Daphne from Scooby Doo with her red hair and purple clothing. She was the one who brought me to Mickey after my family abandoned me, because she and I had previously played together in other areas of the theme park. As patrollers, we had fun using the telescope to try and make our voices deeper and boom more loudly to intimidate anyone approaching the jungle gym. Sometimes we played ""good cop, bad cop"" with approachers who got testy with us - Daphne would play the trigger-happy ""bad cop"" and I'd play the more diplomatic ""good cop"" holding her back from calling the shooters. Sometimes we'd banter back and forth with the shooters across the jungle gym during periods of no activity below. I always wanted there to be activity, though - I found the work of patrolling very fun.

Daphne and I reported directly to a teenage girl named Nicole, who was ""Commander of the Patrol."" She was also the girlfriend of Mickey (people called them ""Mickey and Nickey""). Nicole was really nice to us and let us take bathroom breaks whenever we wanted (there was somehow both a girls' *and* boys' bathroom inside of this jungle gym), and sometimes she brought us lollipops if she'd been visiting one of the candy stands in the theme park. As the sun began to set and the park started closing down for the night, Nicole told me that our gang had been working on a secret project to secure the waterpark as part of our territory. A group of kids from our gang, led by Mickey's right-hand man named Andrew, had been out there fighting for the waterpark all day. Nicole told me that when anyone over there returned home, we would all be called in for a meeting in the biggest ""room"" within the center of the jungle gym.

I went down to the bottom floor when I saw Andrew and some other kids come through the entryway. The beefy third-grade boys who had been standing around the entryway all day seemed excited to see Andrew. These boys were known as the ""security"" - they checked anyone entering in case someone was hiding *scary weapons* like balls from foreign ball pits, or waterguns. Anyway, the security started wishing Andrew a happy birthday. I tried to tell him ""happy birthday"" too, but he just kind of glanced at me and didn't say anything. I tried again, asking him how old he was turning, but he ignored me and went with the security up the ladder. I never got to find out how old Andrew was, which especially bummed me out for some reason, but he was at least Mickey and Nicole's age. Daphne had seen me trying to be friendly, so she told me, ""No one says happy birthday to Andrew because's he's mean. The only reason security does is because he's Commander of Security."" 

Everyone headed to the second-floor ""room"" lined with dark blue foam mats and it was like an assembly. Mickey and each of the teenage ""Commanders"" of different subgroups (security, patrollers, shooters, fetchers, spies, fighters, worker bees, etc) stood at the front, facing everyone else.

Andrew revealed that the waterpark was now ours. Mickey announced that the gang had a new member, and I had to awkwardly stand up as kids clapped for me. 

Then Mickey recited the rules of the gang (there's a good chance I've forgotten or mixed up some rules here, these are definitely not verbatim lol): 

1. No Babies in the gang (kids who still had parents to go home to at the end of the day were called ""Babies,"" regardless of age)
2. No Babies in our territory when the park is closed - we only let them into our territory during open hours (after security checks) to keep up the appearance that we are Babies too, so adults don't find out this is actually our home and try to kick us out of it.
3. No telling Babies or adults about the gang. The only adults who know about kids living in this theme park are the staff, who used to live in the theme park themselves (Mickey's older sister, Heather, is a member of the staff, as well as the former leader of the jungle gym gang)
4. If you grow up and leave the theme park one day, you must take the secret of the gang to your grave.
5. If you grow up and leave the theme park one day, never forget where you came from - this means never letting anything happen to us or the park (Mickey claimed Hillary Clinton was secretly a former jungle gym gang kid who was now running for president so the park could never be shut down...**** I guess this dream kinda predicted the future because after she lost, Ontario Place closed down in 2012).
6. Always respect and obey your Commander. If you are a Commander, respect and obey your leader. If you're the leader, be worthy of respect and obedience.
7. No harming Babies unless it's in self defense - Babies have nothing to do with our fights with other gangs. 
8. No stealing stuff - if you want something someone else has, you fight them for it like a ""real"" member of this gang.
9. Never harm or abandon anyone in the gang - we are your family.
10. *No traitors!* (This means no breaking the rules, leaving the gang, or acting against the gang)

Everyone around was chanting the last rule, ""No traitors! No traitors! No traitors!"" and pumping their fists in the air, until the room abruptly started shaking. Then it became a panicked flurry of kids scrambling out of the room as someone shrieked that we're under attack. Made sense, since we were all in the room with no one left to guard the place. 

I ran up to the top floor to see what was going on. Dozens of kids wearing swimsuits, trunks, goggles, and floaties were storming the entrance and trying to shake the legs of the jungle gym structure from below. I saw none of the shooters were at their stations, so I ran over to the other side of the jungle gym to get to one of the ball-shooters, and I started firing at the intruders. These intruders were the gang of kids who lived in the waterpark, and they wanted revenge on us for taking their territory. 

Eventually I ran out of ammo, so I had to go down to the ball pits to get some more. Had to do a lot of sneaking around and hiding amid the frenzy down""stairs."" One boy saw me and chased me with his watergun for a while, but I eventually escaped with a bunch of balls and went back up to load the ball-shooter. After hitting some more of the waterpark kids, I looked up toward the spot where I usually stood patrol, and that's where I saw Mickey and Andrew. 

Mickey and Andrew were talking, but when Mickey turned his back, Andrew ripped the big yellow telescope right off the railing it was attached to and started hitting Mickey with it. He started yelling at Mickey about how unfair it was that Mickey's sister Heather chose Mickey as her replacement to lead the gang, even though Andrew had been in the gang for longer (ah Mickey, the original nepo baby). Mickey tried fighting back, but lost his balance, and Andrew was able to shove him right off the side of the railing where Mickey plummeted to the concrete floor below. He was still alive, but badly injured, and would need to be taken by staff to a hospital where he would never get to come back. 

Andrew then realized I saw the whole thing and made his way straight over to me. He said he remembered me because I was the only one besides security who said happy birthday to him - not even *Mickey* had wished him a happy birthday - so he was willing to spare me, as long as I agreed to say it was the waterpark kids who did what Andrew did to Mickey.

For some reason, I had the audacity to push my luck and say, ""What's in it for me? No one's gonna believe you on your own...everyone thinks you're mean!""

He asked me what it was I wanted, so I told Andrew I wanted to run the waterpark, since he can't be two places at once and will need someone else running the waterpark now that he's the new leader. Andrew agreed to my request.

The waterpark kids were eventually chased out of the jungle gym. Then, Andrew announced his version of what happened to Mickey to the rest of the gang back in the dark blue ""room."" Nicole started crying. Someone in the group shouted, ""Why should we believe you?"" so Andrew pointed a finger at me and everyone turned their heads to look in my direction. I quickly said, *yes, I saw it too*. After that, Andrew told the gang that I was ""very brave"" in the fight against the waterpark kids responsible for pushing Mickey from the railing, so he was rewarding me by making me the new ""Commander of the Waterpark."" A bunch of the other teenagers in the gang got upset, because this jungle gym gang has a very age-based hierarchy, and all of the older kids wanted that job. Andrew simply told them, ""Too bad."" 

Excited to be the new Commander of the Waterpark, I led a group from the gang over to the new territory to meet up with the others already there. Older kids even asked me on the way there if they could do anything for me, like give me snacks, so I was *really* loving the perks of this new title. 

We met up with the older kids guarding the doors to the waterpark, fronted by a guy named Mike. He asked which of us was Commander of the Waterpark, so I said ""me"" and he looked down at me with this weirded out, disgusted look on his face. I ignored it, though, and went on to swing open the doors to the waterpark. It had these huge multicolored slides, a wavepool, a sandbox, and a giant tipping bucket on top of a water-themed jungle gym, armed with great big waterguns attached to the sides. There was also a big cabinet full of floating tubes for going on the slides, as well as waterguns.

I gathered all the older kids in the waterpark (and Daphne, for some reason) to the water-themed jungle gym and decided to try to make them more content with me being Commander of the Waterpark by giving them their own titles. This waterpark would need its own Commander of Security, so I gave the job to Mike, who seemed a bit happier after I did that. I realized that because this place was so far away from home, the waterpark was gonna need some messengers to go back and forth between us and the main jungle gym - that meant I needed a Commander of Messengers. Daphne really wanted it, but I decided to give it to this older teenager named Sophia and let Daphne be just a messenger. I gave out a bunch of other titles, but the only important ones here are Mike and Sophia.

Anyways, Mike and Sophia started **** me off. They would undermine me by interrupting me and ignoring me every time I tried to speak at ""Commander Meetings"" in the waterpark. Sophia outright told me that I'm ""not the boss of"" her, Andrew is. If I asked a messenger besides Daphne to deliver a message to the jungle gym, they wouldn't do it unless Sophia told them to do it. Daphne told me it was because Sophia told all the messengers not to listen to me, since *she* was the ""real"" Commander of the Waterpark. Mike would call me ""stupid"" right to my face, and if there's one surefire way to **** a six-year-old, it's calling them ****. Mike and Sophia also became boyfriend/girlfriend, so I knew they were definitely conspiring together against me.

I'd had enough of this, so I gave Daphne a message from me to deliver to Andrew, telling him what Mike and Sophia were doing. To my ire, though, Daphne returned with a message from Andrew that said the exact same thing he'd told all those older kids earlier: ""Too bad.""

Then Nicole unexpectedly showed up to the waterpark. She asked if she could talk to me in private, and I agreed. Nicole then told me she discovered the truth about what Andrew did to Mickey, to which Andrew responded by declaring her a traitor. She didn't seem at all angry with me, despite the fact I had corroborated Andrew's lie - maybe she figured a six-year-old kid wasn't at fault for complying to a nearly grown man, even if that six-year-old *did* gain clout from it. 

Nicole explained that she had to flee the main jungle gym, and members of our gang were on the hunt for her now. At any minute, messengers from the jungle gym could arrive here and tell everyone in the waterpark she was a ""traitor""...and that was exactly what happened next. I heard Mike start to shout, ""Guys, Nicole's a traitor! Nicole's a traitor!"" and the sound of footsteps growing louder toward us. 

I decided to help Nicole escape, leading her out of the waterpark through a *super-convenient* secret tunnel. Nicole thanked me before she left, telling me she wouldn't forget this. 

Then I heard a commotion from down below. I looked to see Daphne and a bunch of the other kids yelling that *I* was the real Commander of the Waterpark, and that Mike and Sophia were just big bullies. In the sandbox, I noticed a sandcastle that had been kicked over by Sophia, which had made one of the younger kids (presumably the sandcastle's creator) start crying. On the opposite side was Mike, Sophia, and the other messengers and security yelling that Sophia was the real commander. Daphne confronted Sophia, marching up to her until she was a few inches away from where Sophia stood in the sandbox. Then Sophia kicked sand in Daphne's face, and an all-out fight broke out. Everyone in the waterpark started swinging on each other and spraying each other with water guns. Some even threw sand and balls brought over from the main jungle gym's ballpits. I tried to get down from the waterpark's jungle gym to intervene, but that was when Mike got in my way and quoted Happily N'Ever by saying, ""This operation's about to have a hostile takeover, just call it a little power play!"" 

He chased me around the jungle gym trying to grab me until I made it to one of the giant waterguns and blasted him in the face at point-blank range. It bought me a few extra seconds to try and make a break for it (once again I am *seriously* struggling to run in this dream). I quickly slid down a waterslide and kept running, knowing he was still right on my tail. I then pivoted and scrambled up a ladder to the top of the water-themed jungle gym again, hoping to tire him out. From there I ran across a bridge and continued to run to the next bridge until I heard a loud *""OI!""* behind me. 

I turned around to see Daphne and my other supporters had blocked the way between me and Mike as he was in the middle of crossing the first bridge. There was a pause - I looked around the rest of the waterpark to see everyone else had given up fighting, and Sophia had been tied up - and I think Mike made the exact same realization at the same time, because a look of fear crossed his face as the silence was broken by the group of kids yelling, *""Get him!!""* 

They chased him back to the ladder he had just climbed, and he decided to try and jump instead of spending extra time using the ladder. He lay on the floor with his foot in his hand, yelping. 

The remaining group dragged an angry, tied-up Sophia next to where Mike was lying on the ground, then stood over the pair. I made my way past the huddle and demanded to know why the two of them would try and betray our gang like that. Sophia yelled that I wasn't the real Commander of the Waterpark, *she* was! 

I said, ""Oh yeah? And who made *you* Commander?"" 

""Andrew did!"" she spat. 

The group and I exchanged confused looks, but then Sophia explained that before we left for the waterpark, Andrew had pulled her aside and told her to act as the *real* commander, because he couldn't leave the waterpark he fought so hard for in the hands of a *newbie* as young as me: he only did that because he ""had"" to. After we'd arrived at the waterpark, Sophia secretly told Mike what Andrew had told her...and that was when the two of them decided to try and take control of things. 

 ""I just wanted to do what was best for the waterpark,"" said Sophia. 

Mike said he was one of the people who fought for this waterpark, and he also didn't trust me to run it from the moment he laid eyes on me. He said I probably didn't even know how to do multiplication, so I recited a bunch of multiplication facts just to stick it to him, because *that's* a sick ownage right there, I tell ya. Anyway I started going off on him for what he did earlier and said something about how it was like he was trying to **** me. 

*""Well...actually...""*

Yeah apparently Andrew had also sent a message to Mike telling him to **** *kill* me. Probably figured I wouldn't bite my tongue about the whole Mickey thing for too much longer. Mike said he didn't want to do it, he never would've tried to if Andrew hadn't commanded it, and that he was so sorry.

Everybody was shocked by Mike's revelation, even Sophia. Now everyone in the waterpark knew for certain that Andrew was a traitor, and we needed to do something about it. 

Problem is...we were outnumbered at least 2 to 1. There weren't *nearly* as many of us in the waterpark as there were in the main jungle gym, and if we tried sending a message, Andrew could possibly intercept it and harm the messenger. 

I suggested we find Nicole for help - she'd listen to us. 

You would think someone on the run from her former gang who is literally *hunting her down* would be difficult to find...but nope. I led an expedition of a few people from the waterpark, including Mike to help guard us, while I left Sophia in charge of the remaining gang in the waterpark to test if she could *actually* be a good temporary Commander of the Waterpark. It took about two seconds for our party to locate Nicole.

She was aboard this big pirate ship attraction, with a group of other kids manning a lineup of great big cannons they had pointed at us. 

""State your business!"" Nicole called out. 

It took a painstaking while to get through to her that it was *me*, but eventually she realized and made the other kids stand down and let us board the ship. 

That's when Nicole saw Mike. The two of them started arguing right away, her threatening to blow him to ""smithereens"" for calling her a traitor, him saying she *was* a traitor for finding a whole new pack of kids to lead on this ship, her saying he's the one who tried to **** his own commander (which she knows about now for some reason), him telling her she never would have been any sort of commander if she hadn't been dating Mickey (more nepotism in the jungle gym gang?), her mocking the limp in his foot from falling on it earlier...yeah it was a mess. Tea was spilt. 

Eventually I got them to stop arguing by yelling, *""Shut up!""* which made them both gasp and look at me in silence. 

We eventually came to an agreement to work together to storm the main jungle gym, since we would have the combined numbers to stand a chance against the kids in the jungle gym if Andrew made them attack us. The plan was to capture Andrew, then make him confess to the whole gang.

The amalgamated group of us began walking back to the waterpark when we stopped to notice the *Star Wars*\-themed stage (like the one in Disneyland California) in our path. Something was suspicious about the sudden movement we noticed from its shadows. At this point it was nighttime, and the stage lights weren't on, so we couldn't see very well, but we were worried that perhaps someone was spying on us. Mike, Daphne, and I walked forward to take a closer look while the others hung back. We each split up as we ventured onto the stage. That's when I saw a flash of movement next to me and an object thrown right at me. 

*""Think fast!""*

I caught the object right as the stage lights all suddenly turned on to reveal Heather, Mickey's older sister, on the stage. She had a giant lightsaber in her hand, and she turned it on to reveal a glowing red emanating from the handle up. The object I'd caught in my own hand also turned out to be a lightsaber, though I had yet to turn it on. 

Mike and Daphne backed away off the stage, as Heather appeared totally fixed on me. 

""I know what you did, OP!"" she yelled at me.

*""OP, what's she talking about?""* I heard Daphne ask in the background. There was murmuring from the rest of the onlookers too.

""Stand up and fight, OP!"" Heather yelled. I scrambled to turn my lightsaber on, and it glowed purple. 

She did one of those lightsaber twirls. ""You wanna be a leader so bad, well now you get to *battle* one!"" 

In the background there was still confused chatter from the others watching. 

Like an idiot, I just *had* to ask, ""What did I do?"" 

Heather charged me and started swinging her lightsaber, so I panicked and raised my lightsaber to block her from slicing me with that thing. As she kept swinging at me, she started telling the story of how it was Andrew who pushed Mickey from the top of the jungle gym. The onlookers gasped. All I could do was try to keep up with Heather's flurry of swings so I wouldn't lose any limbs.

She carried on, saying I knew what Andrew did to her brother, and that I *lied* about it. More gasps from behind me. As I blocked another swing, Heather slammed into me, pushing me backwards. (Heather is a grown woman.)

As I was getting shoved backwards and trying to hold my ground, Heather started talking about the deal I made with Andrew, and how I let Andrew get away with everything he did to Heather's brother...all because I wanted to lead the waterpark for myself. 

From behind me, everyone off the stage started making comments along the lines of, *""How could you?!""* and *""You monster!""* and *""Come on guys, we can do the plan without OP anyway.""*

Finally Heather managed to knock the lightsaber out of my hand and make me fall backwards onto my back, the top of my head just slightly off the side of the stage so that when I tilted my head back, I could see the upside-down image of my whole group leaving me behind. When I tilted my head forward again, Heather was standing over me with a lightsaber pointed at my neck. 

I started screaming that *yes, I did it! I lied! I'm sorry!*

She asked if I was *really* sorry.

At this point in the dream I was extremely upset and scared absolutely *shitless*. I told her I really was sorry. I didn't know what to do when it happened; my family had just left me and told to make a name for myself, I didn't know what was gonna happen to me next, I didn't know if the new leader would've still wanted me in the gang after I couldn't stop Andrew from doing that to Mickey, and I was just thinking about how to find somewhere I belonged and make a name for myself like my parents wanted. I wasn't thinking about poor Mickey in the hospital. I was sorry. Did she still want to **** me? 

Heather moved the lightsaber away from my neck and tapped it against her hand, revealing it had been fake the entire time. I remember feeling like an idiot for not realizing sooner.

I asked her if Mickey was okay - she said he's doing a bit better now, but that he ""broke every bone in his body"" (don't ask me how he survived that, Mickey's just built dif). I also asked her if Mickey was mad at me, to which she said no, he forgives me. 

We sat on the stage and talked for a while, then I noticed the sun was rising, which meant the plan to take the main jungle gym back from Andrew was already starting. Heather made me promise one thing before I left, though: after we were done capturing Andrew and making him confess, we would bring Andrew to *her*. 

I did not envy whatever Andrew was in for from Heather, but I agreed to do it and left. 

I got lost in the middle of the theme park trying to find the main jungle gym again, which really spiked the **** out of my anxiety (because apparently it hadn't already been spiked enough in this dream), but eventually I found my way back, and it was a *warzone* over there.

I had to run inside to dodge the shooters who were pelting almost every inch of the cement with balls, but that left me with security to deal with, still posted by the entryway. They asked me whose side I was on, so I quickly lied and said ""Andrew's."" The four boys frowned and surrounded me with folded arms, but then they started laughing and said they were kidding - I could go inside. They told me to try and find a watergun in there...that was what the ""traitors"" had brought in. I pretended to nod before going up the ladder.

It was chaos up there, with water and balls and fists flying everywhere. I narrowly dodged a bunch of balls thrown at me with *serious* velocity, and I knew I would be seriously hurt if one of them hit me. I made the snap decision to run for the girls' bathroom and lock myself inside a stall while I pondered my next moves. Andrew was nowhere to be found, and to be honest, I was pretty terrified of running into him - he was very big, and very scary. 

Eventually I got the idea to startle everybody into stopping and listening to me - I just needed that telescope on the top floor to make my voice boom the way it did when Daphne and I messed around with it. The thought of Daphne made me sad, because I knew she was mad at me now, and things might never go back to the way they were before, but I still amped myself up to get back out there and *grab that telescope*. 

Finally I emerged from the bathroom stall again and made a beeline for the top floor - maybe if I just kept looking forward, no one would see me on the way up. I found the big yellow telescope on the floor where Andrew had tossed it after using it to hit Mickey. I put my lips to the telescope and tried figuring out again how Daphne and I managed to make it work the first time. Try number one...nothing. Try number two...again, nothing. All this noise was going to give away my location to someone soon. 

Try number three...*BOOM*. 

I started screaming into the telescope that *I was OP*, and that *I saw Andrew push Mickey off the railing! He blamed it on the waterpark kids, and I went along with his lies, and I'm sorry! Andrew is a traitor! We all need to stop him!*

A quiet fell over the jungle gym, save for a few stray sounds of kids saying, *""What?""* 

Just when I thought I had done it - I had saved the day, and everything was gonna be okay now - I put the telescope down to see Andrew standing in front of me. 

""You are so dead.""

Before he could move, I turned around and bolted into the gigantic twirly slide that took me all the way down to the bottom and out of the jungle gym entirely. I knew from the booming and thudding sounds just above me in the slide that he was chasing after me. 

Panicked, I started running across the theme park, screaming for somebody, *anybody* to please help me. The park was still closed, but maybe there were staffers around. ****, maybe if I got lucky, Heather would hear me and come to my aid - I knew how much *she'd* been waiting to see Andrew again. 

No response. I had to keep running for my life - every time I thought I'd lost him, he'd jumpscare the **** out of me and nearly **** me. At one point I heard him say he had nothing to lose now, so there was nothing stopping him from killing me anymore. *That's* not at all terrifying for a six-year-old to hear!

As I kept running, I finally saw the waterpark and decided to run inside. I ran up into the water-themed jungle gym and hid inside one of the slides, periodically craning my neck to see any sign of Andrew. Things were quiet, but occasional shadows flickered above and around the orange tube slide I was holding myself in the middle of. 

Suddenly, an arm shot up from below and tried to grab my foot. I climbed back up the slide to see him right by the slide and making a dash for the ladder to get to the platform I was on. Once again, I found myself running across the bridge, *and* the second bridge, and when I got to the third bridge, something seemed wrong. I looked back and...he wasn't there. 

I started freaking out and looking in every direction to try and spot him. Something felt very, *very* wrong. 

That's when he darted out from his hiding spot on the ground behind part of a nearby structure, and that was when I realized he was tall enough to grab me right off the bridge from where he was on the ground. I had to jump off the side of the bridge (it was one of those swinging bridges) to avoid him, and the only immediate place I could go from there that wouldn't mean certain death was straight into the wavepool. I ran straight in, hoping Andrew couldn't swim.

But of *course* he could swim.

Now I had to figure out a way to get out of here. I was swimming deeper and deeper into the wavepool, but eventually I was going to hit a dead end. There was no way in **** I'd be able to get up the ladders on either side of the deep end fast enough for him not to pull me back down into the water. 

I tried swimming toward one side of the wavepool, leading him in that direction to make him *think* I was headed for the ladder, then when I neared the ladder, I ducked my head down beneath the water and pushed myself off the side wall of the pool with my legs. Then I quickly pivoted toward the direction of the shallow end, thinking my plan of escape had worked. 

That's when I felt hands grabbing me, trying to force me to stay beneath the water. You know, because I hadn't already been terrified enough times in this dream, jesus **** christ. 

Somehow or other, though, I managed to wrestle myself free and keep swimming until I made it out of the pool. That was when I started hearing bells ringing from atop the jungle gym tower. I knew what that meant. 

I ran for the jungle gym tower once again, stopping just beneath the structure. Andrew gave me a smug smile as he got out of the wavepool and walked over, probably thinking I had given up from exhaustion. 

""And to think, this was gonna be my best birthday ever,"" sighed Andrew. 

Then we both heard a ferocious rumbling from above. 

I shot him a smug smile of my own. ""Too bad.""

That's when the giant tipping bucket above the tower unleashed its full load of water straight down onto Andrew, pummelling him to the ground. Other waterpark people like Mike, Sophia, and Daphne, had just gotten back from the main jungle gym to see the colossal *dunk*, so forceful that Andrew couldn't even get back up while it was still going. 

They immediately ran over, grabbing and restraining Andrew once the water was done pounding down from its bucket on top of the tower. 

""Say it! Say it!"" they screamed at him over and over again. At this point, Andrew just seemed completely over *everything*, so he rolled his eyes and asked, ""If I confessed, would you idiots stop being so annoying?"" 

Needless to say, we got every confession we needed out of him, and we brought him back to the main jungle gym to confess again for the whole gang to hear. 

After that, we decided to keep him prisoner in one of the boys' bathroom stalls until it was time to deal with him again. Ironically, he was guarded by the same third-grade security boys he once commanded. 

Because Andrew was now considered a traitor, any positions he gave out were no longer valid - including mine as Commander of the Waterpark. But I knew just the candidate to recommend. 

Nicole's pirate ship kids became the newest members of our gang after fighting so bravely to free us from Andrew's tyranny. Nicole became Commander of the Pirate Ship, the gang's latest and greatest territory in its expansion. 

Sophia became the new Commander of the Waterpark, her title now *officially* official. 

Mike took Andrew's old spot as Commander of Security in the main jungle gym. 

Daphne got promoted from former patroller to Commander of the Patrol. I went back to being just a plain old patroller - and I was a-okay with that.

*\[This is when for some reason I briefly switched POVs in this dream over to Andrew, still locked in the bathroom\]*

""Sorry, I know I promised to bring *him* to *you*, but I guess this is the next-best thing,"" I (as Andrew) heard from the other side of the door.

""Did security *really* have to make such a big fuss about this thing?"" 

""Well, they'll get used to it. At least until things settle down a bit and we can properly pick a new leader. Thanks again for coming back, by the way.""

""The pleasure is all mine.""

""He's just in there - I can get the door for you.""

""Oh, no...allow me."" 

I saw the first sliver of light I'd seen since being locked up, and it was almost immediately eclipsed by the figure of someone I knew *very* well. 

She stood before me and lit the room up red with the flash of her lightsaber as the woman I'd worked with for *years* slowly gave me an unhinged smile. 

*""Hello, Andrew.""*

*\[The POV shifts back over to me, standing just outside the bathroom door.\]*

I heard Andrew's muffled yelling and screaming from inside the bathroom, finding it pretty funny. Then I went back to the top floor to meet up with Daphne on patrol. 

I remember feeling a bit apprehensive, because we hadn't exactly spoke since the revelation about me going along with Andrew's lie. I tried breaking the tension by asking if she'd get me a lollipop today, and thankfully she laughed, so I knew things were at least semi-cool again. 

The theme park finally opened, and I went back to my usual duties of barking ""who goes there?"" at Babies and joking around with Daphne and the shooters. I got to handle one big gaggle of approaching kids who weren't taking ""no"" for an answer, but after that, things got pretty dry pretty quickly. I spent the last bit of my dream just itching for new approachers before I woke up, thoroughly confused and disappointed that none of this had been real.",2023-02-01 06:28:25,36106,True
488,Dreams,I had a dream that terrified me and I’m struggling to know what to do.,So at first I didn’t know it was a dream because it seemed so real. I was dreaming of laying down in my room in the dark. So I stood up and even though my room was dark enough it got even darker and something told me to get out of my room. I see my sisters door opened with her light on since her room is across from mine and I run in her room. I turn around and see this flash of light where there is a man in my dark room with a huge grey face with bulging eyes looking straight at me smiling!! His face and eyes were so big! He wouldn’t look away! My room was pitch black! Then he slightly turned his head still locking eyes with me and smirked at me like he was up to something! It scared the **** of out me. It’s so weird because there’s been times where I’ve felt like someone was watching me but I wouldn’t dwell on it. Now I no longer sleep in there and I’m paranoid at home. Could there be a meaning behind seeing this man? Idk. I’ve had plenty bad dreams but to actually see someone face to face scared the living **** out of me.,2023-02-01 06:24:29,1039,True
489,Dreams,Had a dream about being a serial killer and getting locked up in a psych ward.,"So, I don't think whoever I was was ever named in the dream, but his main thing was that he made tons of masks for himself. Each and every one was unique, but when he was caught, most of them were burned.

The psych ward wasn't particularly bad; boring, but not bad. The people there were nice, and the doctors tried to help. 

A bunch of very dedicated fans kept trying to break me out (some using force, some trying to be subtle), but each time they failed. Eventually, I made friends with a security guard there, but he eventually got shot by one of those fans, only living long enough to take them out in response.

The last thing I remember of the dream is somehow finding my final remaining mask somewhere in the ward, freaking out about it, and, eventually, burning it.
Something about burning it helped me move on and begin to recover. I was congratulated by the staff, I felt good about myself, and it was finally time to leave it all behind me.

And then i close my eyes, and i start hearing a loud buzz on my left ear and i saw weird things, like i was having hypnagogia and doing WILD, and i started thinking about 2 dogs (pixar style) about to touch noses (dont ask me why) and when they touched noses, i woke up directly on a dream, still aware i was dreaming, but this time the dream was not so blurry, but i was afraid because my room was so dark in the dream, and then i close my eyes, and woke up, this time for real, at 2:46 am.

I called out to her and when she turned around, she had no eyes. Just caves into her face where her eyes should be. Though the dream was in first person, I felt myself pout visibly, as if this was normal, and I held my arms out to hug her. She stood. I said “hug?” She frantically pulled me into a hug, trying to make out where I was with her hands, and we began to recite a poem about the stars. It said something about looking up at the stars no matter how far away the other person is. She looked at me with that same face of accusation she used to, and though I couldn’t see it in her eyes, when she said “but it’s all dark. It’s dark where I am __(my name)” I knew she was accusing me. It was my fault she couldn’t see, just like it was my fault that she couldn’t move back to her own home because she NEEDED to take care of ME. As she hugged me her now honey deteriorating arms slowly got wrapped around my waist, reminding me of what I did to her. Then I woke up. Only now I realize reading it doesn’t nearly do it justice.

494,Dreams,Birdlady,"I saw this lady in a dream and I was wondering what she is from or what she symbolises. Woke up at 5 or 6 am and added this dream to my dream journal.

I'll try to give you the short version of my dream, I was travelling group and we left this port city to a isolated village in the jungle. A local guided us to this all white fancy house, it looked like a expensive air bnb and the interior was bland with three main colours black, white and grey.

I saw a boy in the kitchen he looked to be about two to 5 years old wearing a dark blue and green striped shirt and cargo shorts and he had curly blonde hair. The opposite corner of the kitchen was was like mold or a shadow and this creature (the one from the drawing) came out of the corner.

I looked back at the boy and back the creature but saw a lady in its place, someone from the group asked where the creature was and the lady shifted into the bird lady. She had all black feathers with a shine to them and her scream was a mix of raptor and banshee.

For some reason I was looking down at her and grabbed her neck and bite into it, I felt her feathers in my dream. That's when I woke up and felt tingling feeling at the back of my neck.

500,Dreams,A new way of contacting extraterrestrials,"I just had a dream in which scientist presented their new strategy for building contact with potential extraterrestrials.  


Basically: There are chemicals that, despite being relatively easy for us to create, don't really appear in the universe on their own. Thus, if one were to find those in space, they would probably be curios about its origin. Therefore, if we were to send a lot of (cosmically speaking) rare materials into space, we could maybe catch the attention of those who pass it, and maybe they'll investigate where it came from.  
In my dream, the material they chose to send was... Sesame Oil?  


I love that idea! It seems reasonable enough, and if you chose the right materials(s), you could even be able to hide/encode some kind of message, like the time that the material took to reach them, our cosmic coordinates, or even the human genome. And sure, we already are doing basically the same thing using stuff like radio waves, but those aren't physical proof, and those get weaker and less accurate over enough distance.

Then I was dragged up into the sky and saw that it showed itself and it was an angel. But not a good one. They had the full intention of killing me. Then they dropped me and I screamed and then I was caught by my guardian angel and lowered gently to the ground where I puked and screamed and cried. They left me there, put like a protective force field over me to protect me and then went after the bad angel that tried to **** me.

504,Dreams,"Reoccurring dream where I get run constantly, almost always ending in getting caught and shot in the head","This has been an ongoing thing for me for a few years now. The setting is always different, the most recent one seemed like an office. This time around there was a huge guy who, and I cannot recall why but this guy angry and was going to **** me. I remember trying to punch him but that seemed to not achieve anything. I then tripped him and tried to stomp on his head, which again doesn’t achieve anything. I begin to run and run until I reach a bathroom, in which I hide and lift my feet above the ground. He eventually found me and I saw the man holding a gun. Right after that is when I woke up.

Another very similar dream was I was running away from another man, but this time in a factory. Lots of pipes laid around  and such. I kept running and jumping through everything until I eventually reached a room. Once the man (also wielding a gun) reached me he put his head right next to mine and a gun to his own temple. He pulled the trigger, killed himself, then once the bullet gets to me it flattened. Much like when you see a bullet hit something hard enough that it can’t go through. After that I woke up.

There are many other dreams like these that I have. Most of the time I don’t dream (daily **** smoker, idk if it makes you not dream or not remember the dream) but whenever I do dream it’s almost always along with this theme. Now I don’t necessarily hate these dreams. In fact, I kind of enjoy these dreams. Sure I’m scared in the moment but it’s also a thrill.

I’m curious as to what people the people of r/dreams think, not at all trying to get a free therapy session out of this.

Fast forward 6 years I totally forgot all about him for the past year or two and all of a sudden I randomly had a dream with him in it. All I remember was thinking if I got him to come with me he wouldn’t pass away like he was supposed to.

Have you ever had a dream where you met someone you didn't know? 

Trick question, obviously.

When one of them wouldn't rest until they saw you again, did you take them someplace special? Did you show them things they can't forget?

Do you think they remember you when they're awake?

Do you think they remember your smile, pained though it sometimes is, painted on in a calming show of compassion?

Do you think they remember you hiding them from something too frightening to look at, and telling them to close their eyes?

Are you aware they've suspected you of stalking their accounts for at least a little while?

Some things have hit too close to home for it to be coincidence, even to someone who believes Occam's Razor.

Maybe it's time. Time to stop dodging with throwaway accounts and leaving hints, enticing though they may be.

Normally I wouldn't dream this frequently but I'm freaking the **** out about how it's becoming such a consistent reoccurring thing (especially my last dream). Most of the dreams I don't remember but the ones that I do are usually nightmares.

Now I agree, that what happens in our waking life affects us still as we sleep and most of the time your dreams can be solved/interpreted as just connecting the dots.

But guys, I'm tired of this. I feel like I'm on Nightmare on Elm street where I fear going to sleep and dreaming. It's driving me insane. I don't know what to do. It's a blessing that once in a great while I will have blissful, uninterrupted sleep where it's just darkness and I'm able to feel more refresh.

I recently graduated and I’d say the relationship I’m in rn is healthy and happy. The dream I had last night was so strange and memorable, that I wonder if it has any underlying meaning. I was in a classroom full of students, I think I was a student also. The older teacher (a handsome gentlemen) had his hand on my leg, and was sitting next to me in a way that would imply we were in some kind of romantic relationship. However, he was proudly caressing my leg and being cuddly with me in front of the other students. Then, a teacher that I had from high school, that I used to have a crush on walked in, and suddenly the older teacher and I started dancing. It was bizarre.

517,Dreams,Shadows,"I could go on and on about the nightmares or sleep paralysis I have for hours. usually when I do see shadows or sleep demons it’s regular for me lol but this last one really made me uncomfortable.

This one I saw a lady with a yellow cardigan and grey pants ( normally they are dark figures or the peer at me so I can’t really see them well). She was standing half behind my curtain, I couldn’t see her whole face but she was waving / reaching for me. At first I wasn’t scared but my dog appeared in the dream and he started to growl and bark at the figure. Then I realized it was a shadow figure and I told it to leave me alone but of course it started to act up an fade in and out (At this point in every one of my nightmares I know I’m dreaming so I tell myself to wake up.)I woke up and I had to sit for awhile because if I fall asleep to soon I go back into the dream. I fell back asleep some time later - this time I was looking up at myself standing next to my bed and I yelled “what are you doing out of my body, there’s a shadow lady” then myself jumped into myself and I woke up. 
Here are the parts I’d like answers or feedback 
1) why did I dream of a shadow in colour?

While I was running around the contents of the cup spilled like water though, and very few remained. I asked if I could have more again, but I don't remember if I got it or not.

I remember I traveled through different versions of my life. Every time I closed my eyes and thought of going somewhere else I'd end up in another timeline.

In the timelines I decided what dreams to swallow and share. I remember eating one about a dream that made others understand there may be conflicts but peace can be found nevertheless, or something like that.

In one the genie kept insisting ""what do you really want to send?"" and sent me to a timeline where the world was ending. So I was going to die soon, and felt pressured, and I tried to transmit a dream where people could understand or feel that things will be ok and that there's more after our deaths.

I find fun how strange some locations were. It was something like seeing different situations about alternative versions of myself and affecting them somehow, then when they had a good moral I'd share it, in the one about conflicts I think I was fighting a friend.

Then as a gift he made the floor be like a starry sky while in the sky above it was daylight, and I could play around and swim in the floor/night if I wanted it to change from solid to liquid.

I had a vision that the boat was going to be broken by some rogue waves and we would all be lost at shore. When I told my family that didn't believe me and that night it happened. The waves crashed through the boat and we had to create an escape plan. My two younger cousins were on the boat and in the dream I was crying and telling my family to go and I would stay behind with my cousins. My reason for me staying behind was because I felt like my family had more to live for because I myself am not a mother. 

I was the only one with no life jacket as there were none left. I put the life jackets on my younger cousins while everyone else went ahead. There was an island at sight and we were all trying to get there. The waves were still rogue and both of my cousins went underwater, I dived down to save them. We all survived and made it to the island. I saw my mother and I approached her but she would not speak to me.

I spent the majority of the dream trying to help her hide in my house and I gave tearful speeches explaining that she was a wonderful person despite her strange experience but no matter what I did nothing seemed to help. In the end she went into a cocoon and told me to get away from her as she didn’t know what she would turn into and was afraid she might hurt me. After sobbing a lot I realized that in this cocoon state she was a sitting duck and couldn’t defend herself so instead of running I stayed ever vigilant guarding my house. About a week had passed and the government finally found her again and were trying to break into my house when spider girlfriend shows up to reveal that in her cocoon she just grew wings. She picked me up and we flew away, thus it was actually she who protected me in the end. What the ****? Tbh one of the most moving dreams of my life

525,Dreams,Old woman gave me grapes and a pep talk,"Last night, I had a dream that my mother and I were taking a walk together on this sort of nature trail. This is a bit odd, considering that my mother has difficulty walking, and it was just us (I have kids and nieces/nephews, so it wasn’t a kid/family outing). But anyway, we were just walking and enjoying the views. We stopped by a little stream to watch it and rest for a bit.

Nearby was an elderly couple, a man and a woman. I remember the woman was very short — I’m 5’4” and she was significantly shorter than me, and appeared a bit frail but not sickly. The man never spoke, but the woman immediately lit up and approached me. She had some grapes and offered me some. At first I assumed she was somewhat senile perhaps, but she was very friendly and sweet, so I agreed. 

She handed me two grapes, and they had some dirt on them but I thanked her, told her I loved grapes and I’d wash them off and eat them.

She kept the conversation going and though I can’t remember exact verbiage, she told me that I was “somebody’s world” and how much I was loved and how important I was. As she spoke she showed me two white lilies growing near the stream with two apples on the ground beside them. So, two grapes, two white lilies and two apples? What does this mean? 😂

As she spoke it felt less like some random kind old lady spreading kind words to a stranger and felt more like a message meant directly for me. Somebody that I didn’t know, but they knew me. In the dream I remarked to my mother that it didn’t feel like a friendly stranger, it felt like I’d just spoken to an angel or something. (I’m not even religious lol) I remember even this random bystander agreed it was odd.

This wasn’t like the type of dreams I usually have. A lot of my dreams I’m not even me, I’m some random character in whatever plot my mind makes up. When I am me, it’s usually the same repetitive themes of like, losing my car in a parking lot or being late for work or whatever. When I woke up, the odd feeling of “this means something” hung around all day. 

I’ve struggled with mental health in the past, but not currently, so I’m not sure what the pep talk was about, but it left an impact. Still kinda feel weird about it.

       usually if I calm down try to let my body relax and try to jolt myself awake it works after a couple of attempts but for this time in particular when ever I tried to move I would feel my brain tense up and it would hurt a bit and I’m very self aware in these types of dreams so i knew better then to freak out and make things worse and when I woke up my brain was in a light pain.

    The only thing I think about now is that was the one time in my life I felt like that could have killed me had I went about it wrong and was wondering if this type of sleep paralysis dream has like a name or if anyone els has experienced this.",2023-01-31 16:59:10,866,True

539,Dreams,what visited me?,"A few years ago one of my great aunts died.
My relationship with this aunt wasn't very close as I grew older but I knew I would always be welcomed in their home.

Within a couple of weeks after their death I received a very vivid dream involving them and an animal.

The dream itself was simple and straightforward. I was in my room, followed an ethereal looking sting ray out into the front door, and there stood my aunt. She told me she loved me and that I was doing everything right, that she was watching over me. I was baffled because I hadn't seen her in years and almost didn't recognize her.

I woke up and immediately googled the animal, it was said to signify to let go of fear and have faith that you were on the right path. That something new would be achieved soon. That your intuition will guide you well.
I had never really been into this kind of thing and had really 0 knowledge on it, so this felt oddly specific and intentional. I have a lot of conflict wondering if I am just making things worse in my life so this was definitely relevant at the time.

I know this is spiritual in nature but I'm not sure what culture to research more of or how to interpret this dream.
Is this what a spirit animal is?
This is my first time dreaming of an animal that has stood out like this.",2023-01-31 14:56:25,1295,True
540,Dreams,Loud whispers in my dream. Not sleep paralysis?,"F21. I have an OK sleep schedule. Anything from 10pm-12am and then I wake up around 7 or 8am. 

Was just awoken at 4am with a bad dream. It has a long backstory, but I got into bed in my dream and I lived in the same country, but not the same place. Dream was bizarre enough, but not very scary. Just a lot of absurd stuff going on. 

I went to bed and I apparently had seen a tiktok earlier that day about how “witch screams” usually means danger. I didn’t think much of it until I heard a very different scream outside my window. I thought “Ok. Whatever. I live in the city. People scream here” and then I heard it again. At this point I started feeling my covers in real life because I was clutching onto them because I felt something bad was about to happen, but the rest of my state was in the dream only. As I held onto my covers, loud whispers filled the room and I had some dark spirits holding me down. That’s when I woke up and made a weird sounding “aGhhh” sound. Not very loud, but I was obviously terrified.

Now, is this a sleep paralysis or what? When I google anything regarding whispering and dreams, that’s the only result I get.",2023-01-31 14:46:02,1147,True
541,Dreams,Recurring nightmares of self defense killings,"I've been going through a lot of stress recently and having trouble sleeping. When I do sleep I have terrible nightmares that wake my wife. They involve me killing people in self defense.

Last night I dreamt that I was doing field training. (I'm a combat medic in the army)I entered a building trying to clear it to make a CCP. (Casualty Collection Point) I found someone in there, but instead of shooting at me with blanks he had a cross now and tried to **** me. I tacked him. Then I grabbed a crossbow bolt and began stabbing him. He didn't bleed, but holes the same size as the bolt appeared in him and he went down.

I immediately started to treat him. I tried to open a Hyfin Chest Seal, but inside were a bunch of smaller chest seals. When I opened those something was wrong with them as well, but I can't remember what. 

I decided to stop wasting time with them and move on. I saw his leg was hit as well and tried to put a tourniquet around it. The wound was too high up though so it wouldn't fit. I looked for gauze or bandages, but I couldn't find any. 

Then his skin started to turn bright red. Almost like someone who is freezing to death turns blue. I remember thinking that meant he was going into shock from internally bleeding and that I needed to hurry. (It doesn't mean that) I then tried to find a transfusion kit, but I didn't know his blood type or have anyone around to get a donation from. 

I asked for someone to call for a medevac, but they simply refused saying I needed to treat the patient. I didn't have anything to treat him with, so I just watched in horror as he died. People around me kept saying I was terrible for letting this happen. I remember this overwhelming feeling of fear and impending doom.

Another time I was near the armory and someone broke in to steal the weapons. He took a lot of stuff and started killing people. I grabbed my rifle from in the armory and killed him. The military police showed up and thought I was the active shooter and started shooting. I killed them and ran. Police kept stopping me and when I tried to explain they would raise their weapons and fire. I'd **** them and keep running as fast as I could. 

At some point I tried to find my team leader thinking he would know what to do, but when I got there he wouldn't listen. He pulled out an M9 pistol and tried to **** me too. I kept trying to find people to listen, but they would all try to **** me before I could explain.

By the time the dream ended I had killed everyone on post. I was curled up in a ball clutching my M4 like my life depended on it. I felt that same sense of dread and impending doom. 

I have no idea what they mean and I'm tired of not sleeping. Does anyone have an idea?",2023-01-31 14:07:05,2725,True
542,Dreams,Is there a way to dream less?,"I have a pretty long history of weird sleep issues - as a kid I was a frequent sleepwalker and suffered from sleep paralysis on a regular basis (until I found out sleeping on my side gets rid of it lol) as well as vivid dreams/nightmares. I’ve also had trouble falling asleep starting at around the same age. I mention this because I feel like it might be relevant. 



As an adult I still deal with trouble falling asleep (I’m also a verrrry light sleeper) as well as bouts of vivid dreams that usually last about a week at a time, every night. They’re often disturbing (not always) but don’t usually deal directly with any trauma I’ve experienced. 




They’re not the usual nightmare culprits either - being chased, feeling of drowning, etc. but instead just weird scenarios. Most recently, I’ve dreamt about watching all of my neighbors jump off their balconies during a hurricane, going to the grocery store at night and getting lost, and my dog biting my nose really hard lol. I wake up feeling exhausted whenever I have these vivid dreams, especially when they’re of a disturbing nature. Is there any way to dream *less* or just less vividly? I do find when I dream, but they aren’t as vivid, I don’t end up as exhausted in the morning.",2023-01-31 14:06:06,1243,True
543,Dreams,Childhood Night Terrors Strapped to the Front of a Rocket,"Starting around age 5 through around 8 years old i used to get pretty intense night terrors, sleep running and screaming through my house while immersed in a nightmare. In one of my first ones i was running up and down the walls and also on the ceiling and it absolutely terrified me for some reason but irl i was just running up and down the hallway. Another one i had i was convinced that i was Cerberus the 3 headed dog and i was jumping on tables on all fours barking at my parents. This is all after going to sleep,  i was dreaming like my own version of reality. 

In this particular one though that still kinda stumps me, i was completely immersed in a different reality, and i remember it very clearly. I was still sleep walking and running through the house during it screaming and whatnot but i only know that because my family would tell me after i woke up. This dream also reoccured a couple times, but basically it would start with me walking through this seeming nuclear wasteland, dark orange-ish sky, hilly dead grass plains with a winding dirt road going through it, i would always go in the same direction the road was leading but in a straight line not following the winding path of the road. In one experience there was a small wooden fence in my way and in an attempt to climb over it, it snapped beneath me and it induced this super intense moment of fear for some reason, I remember the wood of the fence was very fragile tho it was easy to break like it was freeze dried. Eventually each time i would reach my destination, a big **** rocketship, i dont remember much what it looked like just that it was dark and **** megalithic, i would never stop to admire it or anything and i dont remember experiencing the process of getting from the ground up to the top of the rocket but next thing i know i would be fixed to the very tip of the nose and shot through space at light speed, i remember it being absolutely terrifying beyond anything i could fathom at the time, it felt exactly how i imagine it would feel being strapped to the front of a rocket. Like my skin was being pulled back and my body was just jello being flattened by the g forces.

Never heard of anyone having a similar dream, closest thing ive found is michael pollens description of his 5meo dmt experience, but i dont think there was actually a rocket for him, i think he was just describing that cannon feeling of dmt (which i have not done). Has anyone ever had a similar dream? Im 20 now and i still think about it a lot and remember it very well, just never made since why my brain would conjure such a bizarre and intense experience.",2023-01-31 13:49:24,2631,True
544,Dreams,Reoccurring dream but different last night,"I keep having a dream very often about bears. I have seen bears in real life in my home country in the wild and was pretty scared so that is one reason I think I keep having these dreams. Usually I am pretty afraid of the bear in these dreams, they’re always brown bears or grizzly. Last night I dreamed that I was in my grandparents small town where I spent a lot of time as a child, I saw a huge grizzly bear sitting in the distance and started to run home to get away because I was afraid. Then the bear started to chase me and I was very afraid. I knew I couldn’t outrun and I was terrified. When it catches up to me I look at it and realize it turned into my grandparents dog from my childhood which was very special to me, a chocolate lab dog which passed away years ago. I kept running and the dog was next to me running with me. 
I want to know if anyone sees any deep or profound meaning possibly for this dream especially since I’ve been going through and emotionally devastating time/changing/stressful time in my life and I can’t shake this feeling like this dream has a deeper message. That dog also was important to me so it made me emotional. It made me feel really weird.",2023-01-31 13:41:27,1187,True

Previously to her death in the dream we were hanging out and planning on joining the gym together which is unusual since we have a really toxic relationship in my waking life, but then coming up to us going news came to me and she was killed.

She was shot and died instantly and i felt incredibly depressed, in my dream i went for a walk to walk it off mostly to think, and tears were just poring down my face.

547,Dreams,First ever super vivid lucid dream!,"I had a normal dream at first, but suddenly my vision turned all white. I can feel my physical body laying in bed, but my mind is still in the dream (I hope this makes sense). It is just that I can't move. A few seconds later, I feel like my physical body is in a train, like it's moving as if I'm laying on the train floor surface and I remember seeing black shadow figure in the middle of my white vision. It looked like it was carrying me. 

All of a sudden, I woke up, but it was not my room. Not a place I recognized, but it was super vivid. I was standing in an empty classroom, wearing school uniform and it was a sunny day at that moment. I was scared as **** because I touched my body and it feels like I'm physically there. While I'm still panicking, I heard someone called my name and saw two girls and two guys (classmates/friends?) with books in their hands outside the door, like they're waiting for me so that we could go to wherever class we have to go to. I was still freaked out at the time so, I just made up random excuses that I need to go somewhere first so, they should just go first and ran to whatever corridor I saw, trying to find toilet. 

Well, I ended up running to the end of corridor and found a store with lots of empty boxes. After calming myself down, I just realized, oh this is probably lucid dream. People said, you can do anything in lucid dream so, I tried moving the empty boxes, hoping I have telekinesis power. It barely moves, but it still proved the point that it was a lucid dream I guess. I can even see my energy colour. It was light blue or cyan. I don't remember. Soon after, I heard my alarms and it's like I'm slowly fading and finally opened my eyes here. I had auditory hallucinations when I woke up because I literally heard ocean waves like you heard when you go to the beach at my right ear for a few minutes. It's probably because I slept on my right side at the time.",2023-01-31 12:44:48,1926,True

I asked for a cone of minty hail, but the girl who prepared them said they ran out of said flavor, so I asked for pistachio instead. The hours passed and my ice cream still wasn't ready.

My brain totally skips the part of the process of pregnancy &amp; pain of childbirth. Most recently, I dreamt 2 nights ago that I had twins; a boy and a girl. This was my very first twins dream. 

What does this recurrent dream mean? Inner child work? Something else? I have always dreamt of being a mother. My therapist actually believes that the moment I become a mother, I will heal some parts of myself. I would say that’s true, because I feel it in my soul.

555,Dreams,I have a reoccurring dream that I dont know the meaning to,"For backstory, my first serious relationship was with a guy back when I was 14-15. He (16 to 17 at the time) was manipulative and always talked sh*it about my friends and family, and refused to even meet my family. He wanted our relaitonship to be kept secret (getting angry if I told anybody) and he compared me to his ex frequently and said it was normal to. He also coerced me into having unprotected intercourse with him, and also got me to do multiple favors after we had broken up by saying ""You love me, so do this favor for me."" I haven't seen or talked to him for 2 years.

I'm 18 now and although I have not seen or talked to him for years, every couple of months I have a dream with a similar theme. It starts out as me going somewhere (location and area always changes), and me seeing him for the first time in a while, but he's different. He apologizes for the past and we always become very close, with him acting like a better boyfriend than he once was. We always (as far as I can remember) hug and embrace, and he calms me if I'm stressed. 

I have had far longer and worse relationships than my first, yet I don't dream about any of them and have only dreamt about my exes once. He didn't do any of this when we were together, and while I don't consider this a nightmare, it is a wonderful dream that I wish I didn't have. I wake up feeling neutral and sometimes upset.

561,Dreams,Monster Fight,"This the third dream I had in one night.

This dream was about monsters fighting. It was a mixture of Mad Max and Battle Botts. It was dusty and desolate outside and very hot. I was cheering on a giant. He looked like a cross between a man and a troll from LotR. He was winning fight after fight. The crowd was going crazy. I think I bet on him and I was filling my pockets with coins. It came time for the next opponent to show up. This opponent frightened me to my core. From very far away, I could see the monster approach. It was surrounded by people holding ropes attached to its body. I saw the silhouette of a huge gorilla on the horizon. First it was all in shadow, because the sun was directly behind it. But it was HUGE and I wanted to hide. I did not want to see this fight. I felt that if this gorilla were to lay eyes on me, then I'd become it's prey. I found a spot to hide in an old chicken coop (I guess I'm a chicken, lol). It took forever for the gorilla to get to the fighting arena. I peeked out when the giant and the gorilla were about to go in the fighting cage. The gorilla was scanning the crowd and I felt that it was looking for me. I noticed a few things seeing it up close. It was female. It's furry coat was brown, and she had curved horns on her head that swooped downward then turned back to point straight up. She looked confused as to why she was there. I was no longer scared of her. I knew that she was being forced to fight. I thought ""what the **** am I doing here?"" And I woke up.",2023-01-31 10:25:21,1519,True
562,Dreams,Last night I felt like I lived years in a dream. This has never happened before.,"It started on some sort of military helicopter, flying over seas, then landing in a warzone. The dream was just me and my “squad” (no recognizable faces) hiding in one spot, and then the next, and another, so on… until we came across some sort of town centre with thousands of people packed together and the ground was littered with balloons. I accidentally kicked a balloon, and as it went into the air, helicopters started to rain fire. I can barely comprehend what I witnessed after that, but most of my focus was on surviving. I kept my eyes on the skies and ran, once in a while jumping to the ground for cover, or under someone’s body. I kept hearing “I will get us out of here” from all those who were running with me. My dream ended with me lifting floorboards trying to hide innocent people. Obviously a short summary but this dream truly felt like it lasted years. The part that replays in my head is the balloons. It was like I started a war with the kick of a balloon. I often dream of balloons but never like this. Just had to get this off my chest, I woke up this morning caked in sweat and so relieved to be awake.",2023-01-31 10:24:41,1129,True
563,Dreams,I hit my boyfriend in a nightmare,"So I have really bad abandonment issues and I had a nightmare that involved my boyfriend abandoning me. Basically the the dream was him and I were gonna go somewhere together but he wasn’t there so I texted him asking where he was and he was with his friends instead. I called him and someone else picked up and I could hear him in the background. The person who picked up told me he didn’t want to speak to me and they were mean to me and was mocking me. Then I remembered being really mad and really sad. 

I remember the emotions felt so real. Maybe it’s because my bf and I recently had a fight because of a situation a bit similar to this. Not exactly the same thing at all but the situation had left me feeling like he abandoned me for his friends. So the feelings in the dream were very real. Although, this is something we talked about and he apologized for. It’s still something I’m healing from and something I’m still gaining the broken trust in him back from. But the way he reacted to me in the dream was a lot different than how he would react irl.

But anyways, after the phone call he somehow appeared in front of me in the dream. I told him how mad I was at him and he just kept ignoring me. This is where I hit him. Not hard, but I don’t know why I did it. He didn’t even react to it in the dream. It’s not something I would do irl no matter what emotions I was experiencing. It really shocked me and I really don’t like that it happened in the dream. Maybe it’s just a strange manifestation from something else? The night before this dream I accidentally elbowed him when he tickled me out of nowhere and surprised me. I felt really bad and apologized profusely. He found it kinda funny and kept making jokes about how he was a victim and I just kept apologizing. I really don’t think I would ever hurt him on purpose.

This whole dream was a reflection of my fears so perhaps that was just another fear to make the dream worse. But still, the whole dream has left me feeling weird but that part specifically stands out to me.",2023-01-31 09:58:50,2045,True
564,Dreams,NSFW TW RAPE BLOOD i think i need help here,"So I (19NB) keep having these repeating dreams about being **** in the last couple of weeks. I think It would help me to know what other people think of those dreams and maybe you have recommendations on how I can make it stop.
I wish that dreams weren't connected to what I've experienced but I'm pretty sure I've experienced child molestation back in my childhood although those are repressed memories and I don't really remember the molestation itself though I remember what happened before and after and it really affects my dreams.

So the first dream I had was about me having an ability of travelling in time and I was in 50s or something and there were two men who were my friends/colleagues and we went to work and then we turned out to be in some kind of a corner of abandoned house and one of those men ran away and the other covered my mouth with my hand and started touching me without my permission. The next thing I remember is me running away from these situation and continue travelling in time.

The second dream was shorter than the previous one. I was at home in my bathroom and there were two men and they were **** and one of them told me to take my clothes off and I thought to myself that this kind of stuff is going to happen again right now and when i took off all of my clothes I woke up.

The last dream was the scariest of them all to be honest. I was in a bookshop looking through books I want to read when suddenly the man appeared behind my back and he covered my eyes with something and said that i deserve it and then he took me somewhere else in this building and when I opened my eyes I was laying in some kind of a corridor and it was white and empty and I looked down and I was **** and covered in blood and I started running from floor to floor of this building looking for help when I saw three men and I shouted to them that I'm hurt and need help but they just looked at me and went away and then I woke up.

I noticed some patterns of those dreams the first pattern is that I never experienced the **** itself in those dreams it's always before and after and the second pattern is that I have never seen faces of men who did that it's some kind of a dark figure and sometimes it's just voice that I hear.

To be honest here I'm scared and concerned and I want this to stop but I also want to know why I keep having those kind of dreams. I hope it's okay to bring those kind of topics here.",2023-01-31 09:47:30,2432,True

But when she came back she had a few kids and that’s when we really kicked it off. And one day not long after she passed away but she was still with me in energy form. She kept putting her energy in different body’s so that we could still be together and feel each other emotionally and physically. But every time she did that she would loose a bit of that energy until it ran out, at which point I was already an old man and passed away at the same time. I felt the most insane and intense love. Something I’ve never felt before in a dream or in real life. I don’t think what I felt in that dream can be felt in the waking world.

I had a dream that I went to adopt a cat. And the only cat they had for adoption was a black cat that got his by a car. His head was run over but the rest of his body was still alive. So I went to look at him thinking I didn’t want a headless cat (but why not check him out anyway). Then I found him and it turns out his head was fine but the rest of his body was cartoon flat. Then I walked past him and left the place and looked down to find out that he was attached to my stomach. It was weird but he was soft and cute. But because I have Chester (my irl black cat) I couldn’t keep him so I got in a car to return him, and on the way back to the pet store he jumped out of my tummy and ran away. We tried to find him but he was gone. 

&lt;end of cat portion&gt;

Now in the car, it was being driven by some guy. My husband and I were in the back seat. I was wearing no pants and my husband was ****. I covered his man bits with my hands so they guy won’t know he was ****.

574,Dreams,A heart pounding nightmare that turned into a semi-psychedelic event.,"I will preface this by stating. I am not taking any recreational drugs or prescription medication. I recently joined this sub and want to hear from everyone and take in different opinions.

The dream will be kept short but will highlight major events throughout.

It starts with me in the back of what seems to be a moving 12 passenger van.  Almost in a paralyzed state, I’m laying down almost flat on my back and can see the back of the seat in front of me. Moments later 2 men around my age (28) come peaking/climbing over the seat in a hurry to look at me. The looks on their faces were neutral, almost like they were bored. Every once in awhile they would talk amongst each other and laugh. Then right back to the neutral face. I just lay there gazing and listening, they did not talk to me for awhile and I was still paralyzed. Then the van slowed to take a sharp turn and one of them says “grab the hammer”. This is where I freak out, he grabs a hammer looks at me with no expressions and says “I’m going to crack the top of your skull until you are dead”. 
Yup heart is pouring at this point, I don’t remember pleading with the men, I just remember the swift hammer coming down and me going lights out. 

After lights out is when the dream gets hard to remember. I’m in a state of floating but I don’t take the shape of a human body, I’m something else. There are so many others around me who are similar but I know something is wrong. I felt so much fear in this place and the others were constantly trying to pull me in closer to them as if they wanted to huddle around me. I vividly remember trying with everything in my being to get as far away as possible from these entities. I managed to slowly, very slowly ascend away from them still while freaking out the entire time. Once I was far enough away, boom transported back to the 12 passenger van in the back seat like someone pushed a reset button. Same scenario but this time when I was hit with the hammer I actually woke up.

I woke up in my room, pitch black and all I can see were geometric shapes floating around. Some of them in the shape of detailed faces. All the faces were smiling kind of creepily. This event only lasted 10-15 seconds as soon as I woke up. The only thing I can compare it to is a Psilocybin mushroom trip. Comparatively it was not nearly as strong as what I just experienced.

575,Dreams,my dream last night,"i have recurring dreams about being in public spaces unmasked. i dreamt last night not only that i was in a restaurant unmasked, but that i slept in one overnight. apparently, i was travelling with a family that was my family in the dream. i was also younger, and a girl for some reason (i am a guy). still, i identified this person as me.

some time later, we went into a store to stock up on supplies (again i was unmasked and didnt seem to have one available) and we were going through the cereal aisle. i was sad passing the sweet cereals (because i was young, in this dream) and when my dad picked up a gigantic box of corn flakes.

i don't remember too much else. i remember the place we were in looked like some european inspired city from a JRPG. it was very beautiful, although they apparently had what looked like a costco. given that i live essentially trapped in my home thanks to an unrestrained pandemic, it made me feel both in awe and sad.

dreaming about being unmasked is a frequent theme for me (i have stretches where it is almost every night), because i have successfully avoided covid for 3 years and intend to indefinitely, and i literally have not been in any public spaces in that time. i always feel terrified and disgusted. in real life i will never set foot in a restaurant again as long as i live.

589,Dreams,"Chronicles of my Weirdass Dreams: the ""Altar of Fire""","So...I'm very prone to bizarre, vivid, and overly elaborate dreams. I also don't always dream in first-person, like in this weird (and tbh pretty disturbing) dream I had last weekend.

In the dream, there was this village where every so often, members of a specific bloodline are demanded for sacrifice to their **** via immobilization in a cement-like wall before the wall is slowly wheeled (with the people still alive) into the ""Altar of Fire,"" a small freestanding room outdoors in the middle of the village where you can see literal flamethrowers going off from every angle inside. Family members have to kneel down in front of the horrific scene in a show of respect until it’s over. You’re allowed to look down, close your eyes, and cover your ears, though. Some wise old lady is the religious leader of the village and the medium through which their **** tells the people who needs to be sacrificed. Sacrifices are usually two people at a time. The **** never fully wipes out any bloodline, though - most villagers believe the **** needs sacrifices to nourish him, and that this magnanimous **** only picks sacrifices from bloodlines with a “stable population” every so often so that no bloodline is ever destroyed by the sacrifices. There’s also a tiny “****” subgroup in the village, though, who believes that every couple of generations, a bloodline needs “purification” until its only surviving fertile members are the ones favored by **** - like some weird bastardization of natural selection. The subgroup’s belief is “supported” by the fact that the **** has only ever demanded the sacrifice of fertile people - it *must* be to keep them from breeding any more “non-favored” villagers. Families are also **** *huge* in this village - it’s normal to have at least 10 kids, while it’s considered weird to stop having kids after your fifth child. That’s why this one young woman, the protagonist of this dream (let's name her Protagonist since she never got a name), has a “weird” immediate family in the eyes of other villagers. She’s the second-youngest of five siblings.

One day, Protagonist's father discovers from the wise old lady that their bloodline is being demanded for sacrifice, and that they will learn the names of the first two family members to be fed to the Altar of Fire very soon. The family does *not* immediately pack their **** and leave, because…honor and duty and obligation to your village or something? Anyway, what’s so special about Protagonist is that she has the secret supernatural power to go back in time and “redo” things. The only problem, though, is when she goes back to a certain point in time, she's not the “her” that was there at that point - there’s two of her at the same time now. The first time she ever used her power as a kid, she ended up having to shoot her other self dead to keep things from ending in disaster, and she disposed of the body in the Altar of Fire. From then on, Protagonist taught herself that if she ever suddenly discovers a symbol etched onto her forehead, it means another “her” from the future has marked her for death before unfreezing time and doing whatever needs to be done differently the second time around. Protagonist never knows when she’s going to find the symbol etched on her forehead, but if it happens, she has to stop whatever she’s doing and hide from everyone’s sight until she can reach the Altar of Fire and immolate herself as her “new” self carries on in her place. A pretty terrifying existence, I'd say.

After learning from her dad that people from her bloodline will need to be sacrificed, Protagonist tries to do this thing where she repeatedly goes back in time (back before the wise old lady got the message from **** about needing members of Protagonist’s bloodline for sacrifice) and keeps sacrificing her duplicates to the Altar of Fire in an attempt to satiate the **** so he won’t need any more members of her bloodline. This leads to a lot of reliving the same horrific announcement from her father. She’d be like “dammit” and pick another spot to go back in time and just do it again. I'll be honest, most of the dream is just her doing this over and over again and still receiving the same announcement from her father and getting increasingly distressed. Eventually, Protagonist hits a breaking point and she confides in her only friend about her bloodline being chosen for sacrifice - he’s her friend because they both belong to “weird” families (hers is ""weird"" because her parents couldn’t conceive again after child #5, his is ""weird"" because he’s from that “**** subgroup” I was talking about earlier). Protagonist spills the beans to him about her powers while crying, wondering out loud why everything she was doing wasn’t enough for their ****. That’s when her friend tells her about the **** his subgroup believes in…the whole pseudo-natural selection thing. Basically, Protagonist's friend tells her that **** isn’t satisfied because it’s not her that he wants - she is favored by ****, probably for her superpowers, and **** wants her to carry on such a “favored” lineage until enough generations have passed and the bloodline needs another spring cleaning, I guess. Protagonist gets angry with him and insists he must be wrong, she storms out and keeps trying and trying to immolate more duplicates of herself, but eventually, she realizes he’s right and it’s useless.

When Protagonist eventually catches up to the present again, her family learns that the first two people to be sacrificed are Protagonist’s oldest brother and one of her older cousins around the brother’s age whom she fights with a lot. They have three days to ""make peace with"" their fate before they must report to the wise old lady to be immobilized and burned alive together on the third night, surrounded by their family. Protagonist tells her little sister that she mustn’t look at the carnage and that she must plug her ears when they have to kneel down next to each other - apparently, **** is “merciful” for allowing family members to cover their eyes and ears if they can’t bear to witness the sacrifice. I think it’s also hinted that the little sister may have some sort of secret powers of her own?

Anyway, we get to the actual sacrifice and it is disturbing as *shit*. Everyone in the family kneels before the altar and helplessly watches as these young men, stripped **** and stuck inside a wall-contraption, get slowly wheeled into the altar of fire and burned alive. You can vividly hear their terrified shrieks and screams of agony until they finally die and their remains turn to ash. After the sacrifice, the old lady announces that **** has just spoken to her and named the next two to be sacrificed. This time it’s Protagonist’s older sister and second-oldest brother. Just like before, the pair have three days to make peace with their fate before they too will die in the Altar of Fire.

All of this is just too much for Protagonist to handle, so in a desperate frenzy, she goes back in time again before the news of **** wanting her bloodline. This time, though, instead of marking her duplicate for death, Protagonist plots with her duplicate by claiming to be sent by **** on a special mission. The duplicate waits a few minutes and then goes back to that spot in time, repeating this over and over again until Protagonist now has a giant group of duplicates from slightly different times all together at once (don't ask me how this logic works). Then this group sneaks into the home of the wise old lady at night and kills her, tossing her body into the Altar of Fire. After that, the group works together to destroy the Altar of Fire. Once the Altar of Fire is reduced to nothing but rubble on the ground, the group hides out somewhere and practices reciting the same **** in unison for the rest of the night.

When dawn arrives and villagers come out to see the rubble where the Altar of Fire once stood, Protagonist and her group of duplicates walk over to the scene together like a cult and do a semicircle around the rubble, delivering a speech in perfect unison that **** is no longer interested in sacrifices, and that the wise old lady has failed him, so she is dead. Then the group declares itself the new ruling council chosen by ****. Everyone is like “wow, there’s a whole group of Protagonist clones saying all this **** in unison, this MUST be a sign from ****!” so they accept the group of duplicates as their new religious authority.

After everything is said and done, the main version of Protagonist (aka the only one in the group who saw her family burned alive before going back and starting a duplicate gang and telling them it was a mission from ****) asks another one of her duplicates for a favor: she asks her to go back and bring another duplicate into the group to replace the main version of Protagonist. Her duplicate is confused, but agrees. She asks the main version of the Protagonist what to do about the “****” subgroup - they’re suspicious of the Protagonist duplicates and believe this whole thing to be an evil sacrilegious trick. The main version of Protagonist says, “Deal with them however you must. They cannot upset the new order, or many more people will die.”

The main version of Protagonist then slips out of the village alone and finds a way to immolate herself, because she can no longer bear the trauma of seeing her family members burned alive (even though they're no longer dead now), and she feels too much guilt for committing “crimes against ****” by orchestrating the coup because she was “too weak” and “too selfish” to just let her family or anyone else die for **** anymore.

594,Dreams,Please help me decipher this recurring dream!,"I keep having a recurring dream that I’m back in the city I went to university in and I still have my old apartment. It always has my stuff in it from 20 years ago and I’m always amazed that I haven’t had to pay rent to keep it. 

My apartment closet is filled with nice clothes and shoes, that are presumably mine. At the bottom of the closet is a trap door. It leads to a secret, dusty basement that no one knows about but me. 

Buried there is “stuff” I hid many years ago. It’s really important that I get at it, but I am never alone long enough to get it. I know I’m the one who buried it but I don’t know what it is.

Please welcome principal Schlatt!"" As they said that Schlatt walked in and everyone who knew Schlatt went wild, from that day Schlatt was a really amazing principal until one day he turned cold hearted and he terrorized the school with a robot, we where in my classroom when this happened and he got arrested for it and sent to a insane asylum, and when that was happening all the students ran to their parents/guardian's and I was the last one out and I hugged my parents and before I woke up that last thing I recall is a phone call from Schlatt to me saying ""I will be back Fruity_demigirl!"" then I woke up.

597,Dreams,"Found a dead crocodile, a toucan, and a peacock in my attic","Not really expecting an explanation because it's kind of all over the place and quite bizarre but i still think it's worth sharing.

Dreamed about this some time ago when i was about to move to a new house, my old room had a ""loft"" which was really more of an attic than a loft, made for storing things and whatever but i used it as a place to relax, had some bean bags, speakers and warm lighting.

In the dream i was just sitting at my computer in the lower floor when i heard some noise coming from the attic and started smelling something like rotten eggs, no one should be there so i go up to see what was happening. To my surprise i found a dead crocodile (really bloated, laying face down, really big maybe 8 feet or so), to it's side: a toucan balancing on a walking stick, a really ornamented stick almost like it belonged to a wizard or something, he was just standing there doing nothing, getting illuminated from the side by some sunshine leaking trough the blinds.

I stand there for a good minute, just frozen trying to understand what just happened and as i look to the right there was a peacock with it's tail fanned out giving a really bad vibe, don't know why but i felt like i knew the peacock just killed the crocodile, almost instantly i get freaked out by the situation and at the same time the rotten smell just gets worse by the minute. Once i get control back over my body i take this gigantic crocodile and with all my strength i load it over my shoulder and carry it down the stairs with the intent to take it out to the street (it felt like something really urgent, i NEEDED to take it out to the street, don't know the reason why)

After struggling for some time to carry the crocodile, i get past the dining room and open the door to the entrance hallway which was covered in plants all the way from the floor to the ceiling, looked like an abandoned building in the middle of the forest, the task of carrying the animal on my back just get harder and harder from all the mud and plants grabbing on my feet, after struggling a lot i manage to get to the front door, once i open it there was a garbage collection truck ready at the door almost like they knew i was about to take out something big (usually garbage collection in my city happens at \~9pm, this was during the daytime). They take the body, say thank you, go on their way and i wake up.

601,Dreams,"""2 months too late""","So, today, January 31.

I was in this creepy house with angry birds in them (for some reason) as I explored the house I learned more and more about it. but unfortunately, as I'm writing this, I forgot mots of what I dreamed of from that part. Regardless, someone gave me this small paper drawing that looked like [this.](https://media.discordapp.net/attachments/1049487359919530014/1069832004801142784/2Months2L8.png)

The dream cuts to me in a car with my family, driving to get things for my brothers birthday. but then I thought: ""wait, my his birthday was a few months ago. Why are we celebrating on a January?""  And my mom replied ""What are you talking about? it has always been in January"" I was sitting there confused, when my sister suggested for a strawberry short cake she's always wanted. As I looked outside, watching us pass by the multiple fast food stores. The environment cuts to my *sisters* birthday.

I looked around and it seemed to be in my house. all my ""cousins"" where there. yet they looked nothing like people I know. At that moment I thought to myself: ""I need to post this on reddit 'Stuck in a 2 month time skip: am I going insane?'"" (when I found out I was dreaming, looks like I decided to post it here anyways, hahaha) I was really scared. if felt so real. I asked **** what the heck was happening. But I decided to go back tot he party.

My sister was playing with my cousins with this ""Boba tea launcher"" toy. I dreamed of a whole ad section for that too. anyways, they started mildly arguing and made a mess of the room. we decided to leave, and when we did it seemed like we weren't in out house anymore. we where in a mall and about to pay for some things. when I saw a Kuromi plush bag near the check out center and wanted to buy it for my sisters birthday.

It seemed on sale, 180 to be exact. I knew I only had 70 in my bag (with a handful of coins) but when I opened it, it seemed I had another Kuromi plush in my bag. So I suppose I had already pre-bought  one for her. as I handed it to her some creepy guy grabbed it from behind and started stomping on it. I fought with him and retrieved it, but my dream cuts to me on a giant growing tree screaming for my life.

As I yelled ""GOD, WHATS HAPPENING? PLEASE SAVE ME!"" **** climbed out of the flying tree, and told me ""your 2 months too late"" and showed me the small drawing from earlier. He planted it on the tree and it expanded to the words ""2 months too late"" then the dream cuts to the characters from angry birds on a space ship trying to save me. AND THEN I WOKE UP!

What a weird dream. I hope you like reading it! I usually write down my dreams on the notes app but i'm unable to access it atm. and this is my first time writing here!",2023-01-30 23:36:27,2734,True

603,Dreams,May god help me,"I posted on this subreddit a while back about a recurring dream. I can't find the original post, but if you want to know some background information, I had this dream eight times consecutively when I was ten and it was nearly the exact same, only each night it would become more and more and more terrifying. Here is what happened two nights ago:

It started off with me being at my school, then I open a door and I remember thinking to myself ""shit im gonna be late to language arts"". It took me a few minutes of walking down that hallway to realize that this looked like the hallway to my old schools lunch cafeteria. I look back and the door was gone. I keep walking. I soon realized that not only did the hallway look like the old school's hallway, but it was cold, just like it was in real life. I end up passing by several doors, and finally open one that leads to a set of hallways that looks like the floor of a hotel. But as I keep walking, I see an open door to what I thought was a gymnasium. so I went to check it out, but then I realized that this wasn't a gym. It was a f\*\*ing empty theater. on the stage were the instruments of an entire orchestra, just propped there like that. Not a single soul. i then kept walking and eventually reached an elevator. I went in it and there was only one button and it had what appeared to be a cross inside of a circle. I press the button and I am instantly in another hallway, this time, the walls are all white, and at the end of the hallway is a pitch black door, which I open and i see a massive, ten story library, with each floor having a balcony overlooking this atrium like space. the floors, ceilings, bookshelves, chairs, tables, everything was made of glass, and I looked outside and I saw clouds. I had no idea where I was. I began to climb the stairs. I reach a bookshelf and take out a book and begin to read It. it was one sentence repeated over and over again in black ink: ""I must not fear.Fear is the mind-killer.Fear is the little-death that brings total obliteration.I will face my fear.I will permit it to pass over me and through me.And when it has gone past, I will turn the inner eye to see its path.Where the fear has gone there will be nothing. Only I will remain.""I knew that this was the litany of fear from Dune, which I had recently finished reading. But on top of this repeating sentence was another repeating sentence, this time in red ink and it formed an awful looking smile. the sentence in red was: but what if I dont **** the mind? What if i wont go past? And you have one thing wrong: you arent the one who will remain...I am. When I finished the sentence, I heard an eerie piano song start playing. I looked up and saw a thunderstorm off in the distance. When I looked back down At The book, it was closed, which I had left it open. And on the cover, was the same smile, this time widening more and more And more. The dream ended with me waking up feeling as if I had just fallen from the stratosphere.

&amp;#x200B;

604,Dreams,"First post, Hi!! Horrible dream last night, I cannot escape.","I won’t cloud with a lot of details, last night I had a nightmare.

Me, my son (7) and another family with a 1-2 year old toddler were taking a tour of an old church. The church was about 6-10 floors, all stairs. I have a horrible fear of heights so I regretted taking the stairs immediately. We got to about what I thought was the 6th floor where a portion of the staircase was missing the railing. I immediately grabbed my sons hand and yanked him towards the wall. As I turned around I saw the toddler waddle forward and ended up falling backwards off the side. I immediately woke up and had to spend about 45 minutes before going back to bed.

I just keep thinking about it. I feel guilty for something that isn’t real or didn’t happen. I told my husband I’m feeling guilty I didn’t grab the toddlers hand as well when I turned around. He said he’s had nightmares with similar situations and only time will help.",2023-01-30 22:36:32,916,True

608,Dreams,1978,"I don't know why but all of a sudden I was walking down a highway and it was the year 1978. I was born in 1984 so I have never lived in this time but yet here I was just walking in this different time. I can't remember ever travelling back in time in my dreams like this so it was interesting. 

I ended up coming upon a college/university campus and briefly speaking with some students that were hanging around outside. They asked me who I was and I said I was from the future. They didn't seem to bat an eye at this and perhaps thought I was just in character or something, it was the 70s after all. Some of them asked me what to expect in the future and if there's any interesting things I could say and I remember being a bit stumped and trying to find some stuff they could relate too. I told them about planes flying into the twin towers in 2001 and realized that it's so far away they really wouldn't understand or believe me. I was drawing a blank to be honest trying to find something they may find interesting. I spoke about computers and the such but that was typical. Then I finally realized that they were about to enter a massive energy crisis so I told them about that and then I woke up. 

This dream kind of stuck with me these past few days. I'm trying to understand what the heck it means as I've never gone back in time.

he went into a town were two things had been released in search of his wife, he went into the woods with a search party and found severed broken thighs????, and some weird very tall dear skeleton, with no eyeholes, and a head that's too small, that was somehow walking, around had a very long neck, an weirdest of all it had googly eyes where the eye holes should be,

and it went around spooking the **** out of this guy, eventually he went to a cabin after running away from it, and that's where we found them they ate the other two explorers I was with, it's hard to explain what they looked like but I'll try

they were very short bodied I guess?, with very thick legs that were the size of the body each, had really weird looking eyes, and a giant gaping mouth with thick teeth that were short in comparison to the mouth,

basically they chased this man into the cabin, and they couldn't get through, so he started screaming and yelling at them, and they ran off they're easily spooked I guess?, and eventually he walked back to town, and got on a bus where he meets the female character,

&amp;#x200B;

and then her dream happens basically same situation only she's not easily scared,

she goes into the woods, fights the thing to the death her crew members die, the thing dies, she finds the severed thighs, a tree falls down and she finds out inside of the trees have a bone?, anyway she goes to the field with the cabin, and when the things show up she presses a button on her watch and is now wearing a mech suit, she fires a missile and the things run off, she also kills one of them,

anyway she runs to the town in her mech suit, once she gets close enough to the bus stop she presses the button again, and the mech suit returns to being a part of her normal suit which was all black, she picks a backpack up and puts it on, gets on the bus waits there for a bit and see's the guy get on,

she looks at her watch and see's, that they are about to get eaten by a giant bat thing when she looks out the window, the bus comes to a sudden stop and she pulls out a sword,

and the dream ends.

615,Dreams,I had a dream about World War 2 but the allies are losing,"In my dream, the year is 1947. France and Britain have been defeated by the Nazis. The only remaining members of the allies are the United States and the Soviet Union. The Soviets are losing, losing very badly. Despite the numbers of the Red Army and the material of the United States the Nazis continue to push deeper and deeper into Soviet territory.

I was an American soldier tasked out to a joint US-Soviet contingent to hopefully stop and counterattack against the **** wave. I get shipped across Siberia from Alaska since the US had defeated Japan in the Pacific. I arrive to my unit which consistent of battle-hardened Soviet and American troops and begin our counterattack against the Nazis.

Initially our advance was smooth. However this was a façade by the **** forces. Before we are able to realize this my unit and I became encircled in the fields of what I believe was Ukraine (We were trapped in a flat and very farm like terrain). A few of our guys including myself fall back behind a wall and attempt to return fire against enemy forces. This was the most vivid part of my dream, as I could very clearly feel the weight, texture, and recoil of the M1 rifle I was firing at the advancing Nazis. Every time I had to reload I would fumble with my bandolier and pull out a fresh clip for my rifle. Despite all of our efforts and the supporting artillery from the rear the Nazis continued to advance through our overwhelming fire until eventually reaching us and killing us.

It really felt like I had just experienced a past life or something because of how real it felt. Everything had weight and feeling to it. I don't know though, probably just a dream and nothing more.",2023-01-30 19:49:41,1687,True

I stayed awake and had something to eat before going back to sleep at 2, I then woke up to should of my mom calling my name and opening the door, I woke and found it odd since I remember clearly that I had locked the door before going to sleep, I then realized that my room looked similar to how my room looked like when I first moved into my home 5yrs ago just the furniture was the same as the ones I just recently bought. I looked around and then saw mouses running around to then find a web of mouses behind my desk that against the corner of my wall, I ran to tell my mom and she said nothing but then I just said oh my cat can just take care of it when I knew in my mind that I no longer had a cat since 7 yrs ago. I was very confused so I sat on my bed but then got off to turn to it and saw my dog curled up,she died 1 yr ago. At that moment I said out loud this is a dream, this isn’t real. I blinked, now I’m laying on my bed, I try to get up but I can’t I saw my room as it should be but I still couldn’t get up, then things started to get blurry as I felt fragments of that dream coming back like the yellow paint on my wall when it should be white and my mom opening the door.

I got close to her and felt this sense of love and protection from her and thought, why didn't I get this feeling from mom in my room. Something felt off about mom in my room. Then I woke up.

624,Dreams,Weird Reoccurring Dream,"This is the third or fourth time I’ve had this weird unsettling dream. The details of the previous times are fuzzy, but this time was so vivid. I’m calling it “The Sesame Street Parade.” I know it sounds silly, but hear me out. And for the record, I have never been afraid of the Sesame Street characters at all. 

Basically, I start out walking on this path full of creatures that look like something out of Sesame Street. Things are bright and friendly at first, but they slowly get darker and more unsettling. As I walk, I start to feel eyes on me. When I turn around, the creatures are staring dead into me and seem to be following far behind me. I don’t feel scared really, but definitely weirded out, as if I’ve been here many times and I’m used to it. 

I’ve learned that the creatures stay pretty tame when walking with multiple people, or if I never look back at them no matter how much I want to. It always ends with me making it back to my house, going to my parent’s bedroom where my family members are waiting for me, and quickly locking the door behind me to keep the creatures out. It’s always dark outside, and shadowy figures of these creatures can be seen lurking outside the windows, sometimes coming closer and staring at us. Again, we all seem to be used to this and know not to look back at them for too long. The creature who comes up to the window most often is a raggedy, zombified version of Big Bird with bloodshot eyes. As funny as it sounds, it’s pretty frightening to have a usually friendly 8 foot tall creature staring into your soul. 

A bonus detail of this dream is that my old dog was in the room this time. It’s been quite a long time since he came to visit me in my dreams, so it was comforting :).",2023-01-30 18:01:57,1736,True
625,Dreams,Why are train tracks almost always in my dreams?,"Train tracks (and trains to go along with them) almost always appear in my dreams. I have an irrational fear of trains, but the train tracks show up in dreams as well as nightmares. Just the other day I had a completely non nightmare dream where I was a fox and I had to cross through an active train yard. The trains are almost always freight trains. I used to live in a Canadian province that has a lot of freight trains, so I suppose they could be a symbol of nostalgia. It’s confusing because they’ll appear in dreams no matter how relevant to the “plot” they actually are.",2023-01-30 17:29:10,577,True
626,Dreams,Dream about Mother Going Insane after Zombie Infection,"Hey, first time posting and just joined. I don’t usually have nightmares. Or just don’t remember them. This one involved my being at home, in a house and neighbourhood that did not look like mine at all. The house was bigger. Built of wood but in a suburban area. 

The zombie apocalypse had happened but not destroyed life like in the movies. We had somehow managed to stay organized and manage it as a larger society. But there were still random stragglers walking around. 

It’s summer and daytime, I’m tending to the garden up front. Then my brother screams, a zombie has attacked him. He’s bitten and is sick. His skin colour is changing. We quarantine him and he survives but remains weak. 

I then tell the family to search the house. As I search, I find zombies and lots of doors and windows poorly shut or locked. I try to lock them but some keep failing to. Then my mom gets attacked. She doesn’t get bitten, but zombie blood contaminates her. She begins to get sick, her skin changes colour, she seems to age before my eyes as if her body is nearing death. But my cries and pleading for her not to leave us works and she fights it off. I feel relief and we go watch a movie in the living room after I’ve checked all the doors and windows. 

Everything looks alright while we watch the movie. But then I notice extremely strange behaviour on my mom’s part: she hands me what looks like a piece of skin, brown pigmented skin, the skin of an older woman. She says “here, have some chocolate.” I take it and look up at her face: she’s been mutilating herself. She cut off an eyelid. It’s at this moment that I realize that she may not be a typical zombie, but that the sickness has made her go insane. She mutilates herself and displays joy at doing it. No pain or distress are expressed. She kisses me.

Then I wake up. I’m wondering what such a dream could mean. It’s a very rare occurrence. I’m convinced my brain/body must be communicating something. Thoughts? Please and thanks.",2023-01-30 17:19:36,1990,True
627,Dreams,Disturbing set of dreams bothering me,"Wasn't too sure where else to post this, but this has been bothering me for a week or so now. 

Backstory. For years I'd have the same-ish dream. Started with me flying or in this same airport and it always led to the same giant warship. I'd be flying around it sometimes bad things happen sometimes not. Very 90s action movie feel to it. 

About a week ago I had a dream that started much the same way except the warship was just destroyed. It was off in the distance and I had to run while the rest of the stuff around it was exploding. Then I was flying off and a fire breathing jester kept trying to take me out. He ended up being kicked away and I was flying off just watching this giant sea of burnt out destroyed warship and warship accessories. 


A few days later the flying dream started off quite similar, but there was no warship anymore. It was around and above a cartoon Nintendo style village and a cartoon pelican was making jokes etc. It was a really different vibe even if it started the same way. I was also using a contraption to fly not doing it myself either. I woke up and ever since I've had this kind of weird feeling. I know the warships not coming back. 

The easy answer for this would be I left an abusive relationship and this is just my mind parceling that out I suppose. I just had to get it off my chest because my dreams have never affected me like this or gotten to me so much I keep thinking about them.",2023-01-30 17:00:09,1439,True

630,Dreams,Update: I created a mind-blowing Dream Interpreter,"Update: Since the last post, I received a lot of great feedback from people here and request to support other languages for interpretation results. It now supports many other languages! Please try it out :)

Hello!, I am the creator of a Dream Journal app called DreamKit([iOS](https://apps.apple.com/us/app/dreamkit-dream-journal/id1572753006), [Android](https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=app.DreamKit.DreamKit.dreamkit&amp;hl=en_US&amp;gl=US&amp;pli=1)).

I launched the dream interpretation feature using cutting-edge AI technology. Initially, I was skeptical as dream interpretation is subjective and often lacks meaning. However, the results from my dream journal's AI-powered interpretation were surprising - it offered in-depth insights into my mind. Of course, I am biased about it because I am the one who created the app but I will appreciate it if you give it a try. I am VERY confident a lot of people will love this feature for sure. It's mind-blowing.

1. Write a dream journal
2. Tap the ""book"" button on the dream journal screen, then you will get the interpretation based on your input.

This is an example:

632,Dreams,Help: I have been having nightmares about sex with my brother,"I know I know It's ****. 

For the past few months I have been having nightmares with the same context (different surroundings) In each of these dreams I am having intercourse with my partner in waking life. During the **** encounter I decide that I do not want to partake and my partner becomes more forceful then turns into my older brother. 

Some background; No, I have not had some twisted or traumatic experience with my older brother in waking life. As a matter of fact I have a great relationship with my older brother and my older brother is and has always been quite ****/into dudes. As far as the relationship dynamic with my older brother he has always been quite shy and withdrawn. Leading me to sometimes feel like the older sister. We did sometimes get into physical altercations as kids do. My partner and I used to also get into physical altercations when we were both struggling with addiction. (Since getting sober we have gone on to have a healthy relationship). My (and I must emphasize) **** older brother and I shared a room growing up until we were 12 me and him, 14. Our biggest issue sharing a room was arguing over whose side of the room was messier and arguing over what was on the TV. Other than that it was no different from sharing a room with a sister or a dorm with another female. There were no awkward moments. 

Sexually: Sexually, my partner sometimes likes me to take the dominant role and all that entails. While I'm open minded and sometimes like taking the lead and doing certain .... stuff, some of what my partner says during these interactions leads me to think that he has some suppressed fantasies with men. It does make me feel uncomfortable sometimes and I can't help but question whether or not that has a tie in with my **** brother. There are some days where I don't want to have **** with my partner at all but it happens anyways because I don't want him to get upset. I can't help but wonder if these interactions are causing some sort of suppressed rift in my feelings towards my partner. I still love my partner but the feelings on my end are starting to grow more platonic in nature. 

Back to the Nightmares; In each of these nightmares I feel a lot of disgust and fear. I have looked into the experience of others having similar dreams and they do not mention having such a level of disgust in their dream. Only in waking life. In these dreams I am doing everything I can to get the **** away from my brother who is pestering me. I am trying to seek help from someone, anyone, who could get me out of the situation and separate us. I MUST reiterate that this is laughably NOT at all what my reality has EVER been in waking life. It really makes me feel awful for anyone who has been in such a situation. In the beginning of these dreams (as I mentioned earlier) 

An example from the other night; The other night I dreamt that I was in my childhood room (which I shared with my brother) My partner was there and he initiated a **** interaction. I was hesitant but went along with it until I started to feel a little too reluctant. (A similar level of reluctantance as I sometimes feel in waking life.) Then I looked up and to my utter abhorrance my partner was no longer my partner but instead my brother who began pestering me, questioning why I was so unwilling before making more forceful initiations. I ran downstairs and was chased outside. My **** brother stopped at the door to put on clothes while I started screaming and banging on my neighbors door. They would not let me in and so I broke in through a window and locked myself in their house. My neighbor and childhood friend were cowarding in the corner while on the phone with 911 because they had heard my screams. I began locking all the windows and doors. I didn't want to explain the gross situation to my neighbors. My brother who had now turned back into my partner was now going around the house banging on the doors and trying to gain entry while telling me to ""calm down."" and ""just come home.""  

I have had a lot of similar dreams to this and it has been going on for the past few months. I don't know the meaning behind these dreams. Maybe it is that I sometimes want a platonic relationship with my partner and as the friendzone saying goes ""I love him but I love him like a brother."" I still do at times have **** feelings towards my partner, as one should, but for what I do feel sexually these dreams-Nightmares only further extinguish. I hate the thought of breaking up over this considering how much we've managed to overcome and how close we have gotten over the past 5 years living together as a couple. But I don't even know remaining like this and simply setting boundaries would be the fair thing for either of us. I'd like if there were a way to rekindle things. I've tried talking to him about my situation here. He knew that I was having nightmares that were causing me to grow more distant. This morning he was upset and interrogated me on the matter. He wanted to know what kind of nightmares could be upsetting me that much. He thought that it was the standard dreams of infidelity so he went on a rant that I was punishing him for something he did in my dreams. I explained that it was nothing like that and that I didn't want to talk about it because it was disgusting. He still believed that he must've done something in my dreams that I was punishing him for. So I finally came clean and said the thing that you are doing in my dreams is you are turning into my brother. 

I feel that there is a lot more I need to discuss with him on the matter but whenever I bring up how I feel he goes into a mode of self deprecation. ""it's because I'm ugly"" ""you don't love me"" or ""You don't find me attractive anymore is that it?"" But the truth is I find him quite attractive and I do love him. I just don't feel sexually compatible with him anymore. That being said maybe suppressing these feelings is leading to the nightmares? I'm honestly not sure. But I'm hoping discussing them and potentially finding out the cause might help me stop having these nightmares all together.",2023-01-30 16:31:07,6121,True

I saw it peeking out of the bathroom window, holding on from the roof, then I remembered I was fed up with the BS that just happened yesterday and I don't have the energy to tolerate this ghost, so I continued to slap the heck out of the window glass where its face is on the other side repeatedly, saying, ""Girl, you don't scare me, just get lost already.""

I was walking through our encampment past an old beat up RV, when I hear what I’ve come to understand is a skinwalker sound. I walk faster, but hear footsteps so I look behind me as a creature that looks exactly like a human bolts past me with a human leg in hand and says “mommy and daddy can’t help you here” as he rounds the RV, he looks back and I see his full face, which like I said never ever happens, and his eyes are black.

654,Dreams,Last night I dreamt I flew across the country to listen to a concert by cypress trees,"I dreamt I was in my home state of Florida, where I live, hanging with a small group of friends from my hometown (4 hrs away) 

Some of them were down to fly to Oregon with me to go to a concert called The Song of the Cypress Trees, which I understood to be recordings of the sounds ancient cypress trees made, which were unearthed or something

It was going to be in an indoor amphitheater in Oregon 

There were 5 of us and my buddy was a male and there was 1 other guy, and 2 girls with us, one of whom was my good friend; the others were nondescript.

We travelled up separately and I was on the plane with my nondescript male buddy. When we landed it was dark out and our other friends would arrive a few hours after us 

My buddy and I did some weird pill psychedelic drug and went to a rooftop bar on a very tall building. The city lights looked awesome. They were all gold. 

The people at the rooftop bar looked like business people. They didn’t know or care we were tripping 

Afterward we went to our hotel and the friends from my hometown were there. Everyone else was unpacking but I was on the back porch of our hotel, many floors up, watching 2 guys in the parking lot do sketchy ****. They seemed to be secretly loading stuff they were very protective of into their trunk. I reported the happenings to the crew inside. Each time I went in with a development I could see the reflections of everybody in the v tall glass panels that made up one wall. 

The next evening (skipped right to the next evening), my buddy and I were walking long curved rounded sidewalks to the amphitheater on the way in to the cypress tree concert. The air was crisp and the people-watching was prime. An eclectic bunch was also walking into the show 


That was it. I didn’t hear the concert. I woke up worried I was late for a zoom meeting I have to host IRL today.",2023-01-30 12:54:04,1860,True

658,Dreams,TLDR: Dreamt couldn’t breathe because of chains in my throat,"So last night I had the weirdest dream that I physically couldn’t take a breath through my mouth, I could through my nose but any time I tried through my mouth it would be blocked (like if you tried to breathe through a completely blocked nose)
The other people in my dream took me to a doctor who realised the problem was that I had pieces of chain (like necklace chains) stuck in my throat, at first he was pulling out maybe 1-2 inch pieces, all different colors but mostly gold and then he pulled out a piece that was a foot long. Every time he pulled out a chain I was able to breathe through my mouth again, but if I breathed through my nose I wouldn’t be able to breathe through my mouth and I ended up pulling out the chains myself afterwards.
There was one chain that was purple that was 10 feet 8 inches long (literally double my height) and then I woke up with a really dry mouth…

660,Dreams,I had a weird dream last night,"I had a really weird dream last night, but I guess you could say it's more of a nightmare. Tbh while I was scared of it in the moment, now I'm mostly just confused and intrigued as to what it means.

The beginning of the dream doesn't really matter, it started out like your typical dream, it seemed normal but nothing was quite right, like how most dreams are. At some point, I was walking through my house and all the lights were off. I had a flashlight, and my father was standing over by the light switch, but he hadn't turned any lights on yet. I walk up to the wall and when I look to the top of it, where it's supposed to meet the ceiling, there's a gap. The gap is like 2-3ft wide and it spans the whole length of the wall. Somehow, not quite sure how, I climb up the wall to look through the gap. When I shine my flashlight through, I see another room, that logically shouldn't be there, since this wall is an exterior wall to my house. Inside the room, there are two tall, humanoid creatures. They're tall enough to see over the gap just standing, we're talking 7+ ft. They have pale, yellowish skin and elongated skulls, kinda like the stereotypical aliens you see in media. The worst part is, though, they have human eyes. The creature standing closest to me turns and looks me in the eyes. When it does, it starts screaming and I notice that it's mouth is oddly diamond shaped. The scream isn't human, it sounds more like metal scraping against metal, and as I hear the scream, I feel myself being lifted up into the air. I yell at my dad to turn the lights on, but before he can do that, I hear in my brain,

""You aren't supposed to be here.""

Then I wake up. I didn't scream, but I was breathing heavily and my heart was pounding. I looked over at the clock and saw it was 3:14 am. Somehow, I knew that the creatures were called ""sowers"" and for those of you who don't know what that means, it's a person who plants something, and it's used in several metaphors in the Bible. Two things I noticed was that my body was oddly hot, so much so that I was sweating despite my window being open (it's winter rn, so like 50°F in my room). The other thing I noticed was that, although my room was completely dark, it felt like there were lights on, behind my eyes. They were so bright I almost couldn't see. Idk how else to describe it. I sat there for a few minutes, trying to calm down, but the dream just wouldn't leave my head. So I grabbed my phone and quickly wrote it down in my notes app before going back to sleep. The attached image is what I wrote.

I have no idea what this dream means, but it could be nothing. I have chronic nightmares, one almost every night, and they're notorious for being extremely detailed and extremely creepy, but idk, this one just stood out to me. It felt more like a vision than a dream. If anyone who reads this has any ideas, I'm all ears, and if anyone wants to hear about more of my creepy dreams, I have plenty to share.

662,Dreams,I beat my 'wet' dream,"You know those dreams when you're looking for a toilet, or actually **** in your dream and you wake up, well, wet or barely make it to the toilet on time? I actually 'survived' on of those:

In my dream my mom, a friend and I stopped at a parking lot, I had to ****, so walked to the back of the parking lot and peed against the wall. Then my dream became unclear, was inside a building for a while, started walking down a street to end up walking in a forest, next to a little stream, yeah my brain is really trying to tell me something. It's not until I meet up with people I barely know irl who started up a barbecue, next to the stream I finally wake up. Dry! Not a single drop, I even layed there a couple of minutes thinking of the dream before I got up and walked to the toilet.

So yeah, although from what I remember I peed early on in my dream I kept it dry and I'm dang proud of it to!",2023-01-30 11:11:52,896,True
664,Dreams,I require a dream wizard to explain this dream to me,"so it started off normal right, I was working in a gun store and a dude came in talking about this sick game, I was offered a chane to play a game, and I accepted, and I got to this location and there was a lot of people I didn’t know, but they all were like an individual, they didn’t act like dreambots, and turned out this wasn’t a game but a trap, and we all got teleported to rooms we had to escape from, and each time U escaped the room, 2 rooms were connected to another room, and turned out the way to leave that room was to solve the room together, but the final lock on all the rooms was a blood sacrifice for some reason because we solved the riddle, so U had to **** each other, and the winner would go into a next room, and repeat, I ended up making it through, and these fights were fiiiiiights, I mean detailed, and in all these rooms there was like a strobe outside, but turned out that the “strobe” was the moon and the sun passing cuz the person I was with in that room recorded it on their phone and slowed it down, meaning time was different in this place, and then I got to the last room, and I met the guy who offered me the chance to come, but it wasn’t a man it turned out to be a otherworld being thing, and it was all like congratulations, blah blah, and explained no one had died irl, they just woke up and didn’t deserve the prize, and then gave me this like power up and told me I was free to go until next time, and I just walked through the door and woke up

weird thing is I’m like a dream walker, prob due to my native blood, so I control my dreams a lot, if I don’t like something I change it, if I die or fall I don’t wake up I just respawn or start to fly, if I wake up and I want to resume where I left off cuz I needed to go to the bathroom or something I just go back to sleep and resume, I remember all my dreams, and it’s been like that since I was a kid, I am always excited to sleep because idk where I’m going but I know there is the possibilty of an adventure, but I wasn’t in control this time",2023-01-30 10:59:02,2039,True

And it kept spiraling from there about what I would do about my baby. Like is it too late to put it up for adoption? Well what if I do this or that in order to do the plans I had set? It was a wild panic and I don't really know what to make of it. Either it was just a silly dream or could it have deeper meanings.",2023-01-30 10:44:29,589,True
666,Dreams,I dreamt my husband murdered someone,"This isn’t anything new, surprisingly. We’re newlyweds but for a long time now I keep getting dreams about him either cheating on me or somehow leading me to my death. Just to preface this, he is an amazing man who has done nothing but be kind and loyal to me.

Onto the dream:
My husband was driving us to my job in this new car he somehow found himself in possession of. I was sitting in the seat right behind him. We pulled up to my job and we sat in the car for a few minutes talking before I got out. He then proceeds to tell me the most bone chilling thing.

“This isn’t my car, and there’s someone under your seat.”

I was panicking as this man just told me there’s a dead body under I seat I was sitting on. He was looking at me with a sinister smile, awaiting my response to what he said. I knew I had to leave but I didn’t want him to get suspicious of me.

“Where are we going to hide it?” I asked him.

He proceeded to tell me that he had that covered, but he wanted me to throw out any loose items in the car. I began grabbing things and throwing them into a deep ditch to the side of my job. He then pulls off to dispose of the body.
I didn’t know what to do other than contact the police. When I went to call them their line was down. I was frantic and went to go tell my manager, but then I saw my husband walking towards me. I tried to compose myself and he passed me. I ended up finding a note on the ground telling me how this all came to be. Turns out he had stolen that car and pretended to be a taxi driver. When a young woman entered the vehicle he attempted to **** her. He refused immediately since she was also married. He became furious and killed her by repeated blows to the head.

He was out of sight so I saw this as my chance to reach my boss. I quickly ran over to his and alerted him of everything. He thought I was joking but I demanded that he call the cops to see if it would possibly work for him. It worked and the police had began to make their way over to my job. I went back to my desk where my husband was waiting for me. He began asking me things, trying to figure out if I had told on him. He told me to **** him but I refused and told him I couldn’t just let him get away with that. Bingo, he caught me. He now knew that I did in fact call the police on him. He was internally furious, but was outwardly calm. Almost scarily calm.

He approached me and put his hands on my shoulders. He then began whispering in my ear threats on my life and the lives of other people I knew and loved. He never loosened his grip on me, tightening it instead. The cops never arrived

And then I woke up",2023-01-30 10:40:34,2631,True

Today when I woke up, I just felt different.. I had a dream but this wasn’t like anything I’ve ever experienced dream wise. It was my life playing out at a insane speed kind of “picking parts” of things I had done in the past BUT they were slightly different, something wasn’t right about everything that happened.. certain details or things that happened in “real life” were different in this dream.. but all morning I’ve been slowly recalling things from the dream and how they differ from what I experienced when I was living those moments / awake. I’d like to add I just have a weird like vibe I’m feeling while I’m remembering these dream things and life things. 

So I just was wondering if anyone has experienced something similar, or the same! And what your take on this is, possibly another reality, just my mind playing tricks? I don’t know what to think honestly.",2023-01-30 09:58:08,1110,True
670,Dreams,What does it mean,"So I’ve had a reoccurring dream, I wouldn’t call it a nightmare but it’s not exactly a happy dancing on clouds dream either. Essentially all the dream is, me crawling thru a tight tube that’s completely black and all I can see is a light at the end and all I can hear are just people laughing and ridiculing me for everything etc, (dealt with bullying and all that my entire life) anyway, once I get to the end and get out of the tunnel my girlfriend is standing there and the second I see her all the other noises from everyone and everything completely stop. I’ve had this dream about 11 times now and it gets more detailed every time.

671,Dreams,idk if it counts as dreams?,"Sometimes I have these like half asleep hallucinations that something scary is happening in my room. Idk how to describe them, but a few times I’ve been kinda sleeping then I see a spider in my room, I scream and run out the door in my sleep, then I wake up and check if the really was spider (there never is). This only happens at night apart from last week, when I was taking a nap after being up literally all night. I saw blood dripping from the ceiling right above me, I felt and saw it in my hand and I ran to my dad in hysterics and didn’t realize it was a dream/hallucination until I came back to my room &amp; saw the ceiling and there was no blood. A woman died in the apartment across from me by suspected **** so I think this is what it was caused by. (the scariest one I’ve had) A few other examples are that I’ve seen a person in my bed, a demon going into a portal, and my room covered in spiders hanging from the ceiling. It happens more often if I’m having trouble sleeping like when I’m trying to sleep earlier than normal, and I almost always end up running out or to the door. Im sure it’s caused by anxiety but I’ve never heard of anyone else suffering from this, it’s not like sleep paralysis, anyone know if there’s a name for it?",2023-01-30 09:37:00,1253,True

674,Dreams,Question if anyone’s experienced this,"Not sure where to post this, but last night I had a dream that my grandma who passed in December visited me. I’ve been having a hard time processing her death so this was very welcome and it was a pleasant visit. Now, it’s important to note, that I’m nearly always aware that I’m dreaming (I was in this case), and often control my dreams but only in very minor ways, like I can’t shift the direction of my dream easily but more than that, it’s rare. And I should also note I’m not religious nor do I have an easy time believing in the supernatural. In my dream, my grandma showed me what her and my aunt Neve (her sister who passed two weeks prior) were seeing. And it was beautiful and I’ve never felt more joy. Unfortunately though, she went on to tell me that I’ll pass on with her during my upcoming surgery 😐 so my questions is, has anyone ever experienced this and NOT died? I only ever hear of the ones where they do. But why would the inverse be news I guess. (Sorry if this is the wrong r/ to post this to)",2023-01-30 09:07:58,1016,True
675,Dreams,"I returned to a fictional place in a dream for a second time, two whole months after dreaming about it for the first time.","About two months ago, I dreamed about going to a certain place to fix my bicycle, the one that I use in real life. 

That bicycle place in the dream was run by someone that I'm not familiar with, but in the dream I sorta knew who he was and he was quite popular, receiving a lot of clients on daily basis.

The location of his place was also sorta weird. He worked in a small shack that was essentially placed on the premises of a children's school yard. 

The entire dream was set in an area that I've never been to but it still looked oddly familiar, as if the dream's assets were taken from places that I go to in real life, if that makes any sense. That was the first time I dreamed about that place, and there wasn't a lot going on in it. 

Anyway, a few days ago, I had another dream, and to my unimaginable surprise, I returned to the same **** place. That same liminal looking school yard, same shack, and even the same person who owns that bicycle store. I needed him to fix my bicycle again, but this time my bicycle was almost a total wreck, so I had to wait there for awhile until he finished working on it.

As he's busy working, I take a look around, seeing children running and playing in the yard, seeing the sun up there in the sky, it was a beautiful summer day. But all of a sudden it just dawned on me.

**I've already been here before.**

It took me by such a surprise that I felt like somebody smacked me right in the face. Why the **** am I revisiting a place that I've indeed been to before but **not** in real life...? At that point I guess my consciousness couldn't really take it or understand it, and I woke up. It wasn't like, scary or anything, but still weird enough to trigger an end for the dream. 

There's a good chance that this is the first time in my life in which I revisited a fictional place in a dream, I don't recall anything similar to this ever happening to me in my dreams before. I did have in the past multiple dreams about places that exist in real life, but never fictional places like in this specific case.",2023-01-30 08:58:18,2058,True

I started to grow suspicious, and I said something like, ""Isn't it crazy that we're hanging out still after all this time?"" and I don't remember if anyone replied, but I started touching one of my friends on the arm and he was like ""Wtf are you doing?"" and I said ""Trying to see if this is real or not."" Nothing happened at first but I started to rub at my eyes because of the discomfort and then I woke up.

685,Dreams,I just had such an intense dream &amp; that I woke up crying.,"I’ve never felt a dream so intensely to be very honest. And I think the reason for that is partly because I meditated right before I went to sleep. I’ve been wanting to do that for a long time and when I finally did it, it was kind of an intense experience. 
So this is what happened in my dream: I was initially sleeping and then something woke me up (which made the dream feel more realistic). I go outside my room and I see my boyfriend getting really cozy with someone. I freak the **** out and suddenly I cannot breathe because I’m so so angry. I was still trying to catch my breath when I woke up and then I burst into tears.
Now, the weird part about this dream is, I’ve been having a hard time controlling my emotions, keeping them in check, or just have a grip on them. When this scary characteristic of mine made it’s way into my dreams, it just scared the **** out of me. Like, how ingrained does a thought have to be, that you start dreaming about it? All in all, it was a weird experience but I’m still looking forward to meditating before sleeping, to see what else comes up, so I can deal with it on a conscious level.",2023-01-30 05:43:12,1133,True

687,Dreams,Just woke up from an odd dream where I felt I couldn't wake up; what is this?,"Hey, all. 

At 2:04 AM, I decided to go to bed. About an hour before this, I had a roll, some chocolate, and a couple sips of Diet Coke. For the last couple of days, I've had this sharp/burning pain in my upper left chest that comes and goes. At first, I figured I was having a heart attack, but I feel it might be heartburn/acid reflux/GERD instead. I say all of this because I started to feel that pain again as I was about to go to bed. 

Anywho, at 3:40 AM, I woke up. Officially woke up. But the dream really messed with me. I remember laying on the couch, my mom came in, was joking around, and said goodnight. About a minute later in the dream, I got a FaceTime call from her, but when she picked up, she was at Walmart with a cart full of groceries, showing me a stack of 12-packs that were on sale. I thought this was odd, questioned how is that even possible if I had just seen her, and then realized I was dreaming. I tried to wake myself up by closing my eyes really tight and opening them again, but nothing worked. 

I come from a Christian background, so I remember in my dream thinking, ""Maybe this is Satan messing with me."" Right around that time, I started to feel like I was dizzy in the dream, like the world was warping. I continued to close my eyes tightly and open them again, but nothing. Eventually though, I was able to ""wake up"" only to have that sense that something wasn't right. Sure enough, I still wasn't actually awake. So, the same thought pattern occurred, only this time I started to wonder, ""Am I dying?"" 

I finally woke up for real at 3:40 AM, got on the internet and tried to research what was going on. Can y'all provide any feedback?",2023-01-30 05:12:43,1676,True
688,Dreams,This was my really weird dream from last night. Copied and pasted from when I woke up.,"I have to write this down now so I don’t forget but here’s my dream from tonight.

I saw somebody getting their haircut at a salon by Michael Jackson. I waited until they came out and followed them for some reason because I think I wanted to ask them something about the haircut. They went down the street to some place called “Yips’ chit chat” where people would just sit outside and talk to each other. I got caught up in conversation with these people and had to explain to them what I was doing there. After I got away from them I ended up finding the girl with the haircut but everybody was swarming her because Michael Jackson gave her the haircut. I went to talk to her or something and she ended up adopting me or some ****. I was like reborn again but still my same age. I the dream ended when I found out that because we were both black that I couldn’t get all my birth shots and that I wouldn’t end up living very long.

691,Dreams,Is it just a coincidence? or is there an unknown connection between the dream world and the physical world?,"Is it  a coincidence when I dream of this friend of my mine and when I wake up to check my inbox there is a message from the said friend, it has happened for many instances.

So me and my friend don't usually message each other, messages would compose of them greeting me on a holiday, checking up on me, the usual of them sending me a picture of themselves and then I ask them how they are doing, saying their problems to me, and the most recent is for planning for a hangout.

The thing is, whenever I have a dream about this specific friend of mine I would see myself and them exchanging messages with each other, I usually forget what the messages say in the dreams, then when I wake up, I immediately check my inbox and coincidentally there is a message from them.

Every time without mistake, I dream about them the day before and when I wake up I recieve a message from them.

kinda tempted to go, but it's halfway across the country. anyone ever done this? did you meet who you told or who told you? it'd **** if I flew there and they're like, I have no idea what you're talking about, cause they didn't remember when they woke up.",2023-01-30 04:37:21,593,True

Then he came to the bathroom and started brushing my teeth. My mom came from my parents room and asked what was going on. I was like ""duh, Santa Claus is brushing my teeth and then he's gonna sleep in the attic"". She was like ""okay then"". After he brushed my teeth, he went sleeping and for some reason there was a candle and hay in our attic and I could see him weirdly through the roof. I went to my bed too and then the dream ended.

695,Dreams,The undertaker dream,"I'll begin by saying I'm not a writer, I'm only here because I recently met someone who, after hearing a few of dreams suggested I share them on reddit. So here I am at 6:09am on a Monday. 

Also fortunately or unfortunately the dream goes on for longer then I can remember so I can only share the end. 

I'm travelling through London, somewhere in the city centre in the early hours of morning, it's either a Friday or Saturday. I know this because the streets are buzzing with crowds of **** people and music.

I'm not alone. A girl in a leopard fur coat and short black hair is holding my hand and dragging me through the crowds with purpose as her friend, a blonde blurr, follows behind me. 

Eventually we get to a side road that reassembles more of an allayway, but opens up into a boxed carpark, with one entrance and one exit, the way we came in. As we walk further into the carpark I notice only one other person, a man, standing in front of a car with its hood open, he's wearing a long, black, almost leather looking coat that, despite him being over 6foot reaches his knees, paired with a Wide Brim Open Crown hat, hence the name and title 'the undertaker'. 
The girl let's go of my hand and rushes toward the undertaker, she doesn't recognise him, but I do. I had already heard the stories of what he was capable of, and as those stories rush through my head I freeze in fear. 
She approaches him, taps his shoulder and begins to question him on his intentions, he doesn't respond verbally or physically, he also freezes.

I rush towards her and try to pull her away, she turns to me, and explains that this is her car, and that he, the undertaker, shouldn't be touching it. I turn away, back towards the way we came in search of her friend, the blonde blurr for help. By the time I turn back, the undertaker is gone, and fear takes over me again, this time allowing me to take one step back. 

She, unphased, proceeds to close the hood of her car, and just as quickly as he vanished, the undertaker reappears but this time with a light transparent fog around him. He grabs her from behind and vanishes with her.  This time the fear reaches a new height and brings life to my legs, I dash towards the sideroad. I must have made atleast five strides before he re-appears, but this time in front of me, he doesn't wait to be spoken to or speak a word to me, he grabs me and we disappear....

When I awake I'm in my own bed, partly paralysed as if a drug was wearing off, i try to sit up countless times, managing to reach halfway before falling back, each time I fail my heart rate intensifies. 

Suddenly a burst of erratic, panicked voices shock my ears. I look towards my feet, where the voices are coming from. What I see confirms this is a nightmare and not a dream. 
My legs have been sawed off, only a pool of blood remains, and pass my bed is my wardrobe, I can only see the side view of it and it's doors are open, on the door itself is the source of the panicked voices from earlier, four **** girls, somehow infused with the door, one on top of the other the full length of the door. Somehow, these girls are 2D and 3D at the same time. Only there torso and above remain, there torsos hanging out of the door, like a sticker being peeled off. Each girl is erratically pointing at a corner of my room above my bed, through everything they hadn't stopped shouting, unfortunately there voices had merged together and became one inaudible noise. I turn to where they're pointing, I see nothing, as I look back at them, they're trying to alert me more franticaly, however this time they're pointing in the opposite corner. 
This time I can't bring myself to look...
This time I decide to wake up....

The end 😅

697,Dreams,I dreamed a whole visual novel from start to finish,"Dunno if this is right for this sub, but i wanted to share it somewhere

Anyways.

This starts in a star-wars esk setting where people just casually travel from planet to planet.

MC and a friend are in a party in a mansion in some planet. But we aren't invited, and instead are trying to nick something from it (i think?) I only remember us getting caught redhanded and having to run away by scaling the wall and jumping off.

Following while walking away from the mansion that the friend loredumps that this is a world all messed up and inhabited only by women, some of which were serving at the party, and that most of the planet is uninhabitable (looking at it in hindsight probably because of a war? Few men left and most of the planet is in ruins of what used to be a civilization...)

Until we end up running into a fully functional city where we are welcomed by one of the few men left, the guy running the city, with most other men left being his cronies, who are happy to receive any men who will stay with them since they are in a... Shortage of guys, what isn't great in the long run if you are trying to keep a civilization going.The city itself is again a futuristic-esk setting filled with little robots and lots of neon screens, helped being run by an AI the boss guy bragged about as well.

This boss guy also gives some big vibes of being one fitness gurus, going on about how you have to read lots and work out lots to have a strong body AND mind if you are going to stay (and only MC does, the friend goes home or something? Idk Don't remember what happens to him but he doesn't show up again.), so he tells you you should pick up some books on your way to the new home

&amp;#x200B;

Anyways then we get into the actual dating sim part of the game where mc is taken to what will be his room from now on and introduced to a bunch of local girls in a college-esk setting and has to choose one to interact with, with most of them being overly interested in him since he's one of the few guys they've ever seen, let alone one around their age. With me ending up choosing to spend time with the quiet one, later on learning she's getting bullied by some of the others and actually doesn't like the whole reading and working hard culture

&amp;#x200B;

It's also at this point that the dream shifts fully from being a first person thing into  full on about me playing a character in a visual novel with me reloading after messing things up with her, and later on straight up saving and seeing dialogue options

&amp;#x200B;

Either way MC gets into a relationship with her and yada yada. Most of it is a blur, except for the final part of the story.

MC gets to befriend one of the few local guys left not directly working for the boss guy, and he sneaks MC out of the city for a tour trough the rest of what used to be the country, seeing a bunch of ruins and post-apocalyptic-esk stuff and lore dumping about it as they go (don't remember most of it what's a shame)

But when we get back boss-guy catches us and scans MC and the friend, seeing the items they have on the and where they've been, and declares that we weren't supposed to leave the city because something something history revisionism and stuff his people weren't supposed to see so he's going to punish us.

At what point i see the options to accept it, run, fight, or try to bargain- Choosing the latter after saving in case i mess up, what causes MC to argue he didn't know they weren't allowed to leave the city... Since he was never told so. So boss-guy ends up resigning to that and letting MC go, only ordering his cronie to **** the new friend. And again, I get the options to accept that, try grab him and run away or... Ask for help.

With me again choosing the final one, at what point the friend tries to run away and the cronie sets off after him, but MC yells for the AI to help him- What she does, sending one of the little helping robots to neutralize the cronie. Turns out the AI does have a full-on personality of her own and also likes MC (how convenient). So next I get the option to ask her to take down the boss guy, what she does after a chase scene after him if I make MC claim he loves her.

&amp;#x200B;

After what I get a full on epilogue scene with MC as the new boss, the AI and the girl I choose older and waiting for a child (ofc), and that new friend, all happy with the MC.

&amp;#x200B;

And I get woken up by my dog barking a bit after that, with the last part of the dream being me going even harder on 4th wall breaking straight up googling other scenes and routes with the different girls to see if they were any different.

The second was was about committing suicide. More specifically I slit my own throat. In the dream, I felt the sensation of the wound around my neck and even saw blood around the neck of my T-shirt when I looked into the mirror, the tshirt was yellow so it was a very distinguishing feature.

I get on the bus after exiting a weirdly familiar school building and apparently i forgot something.

Anyways oh **** he passed my neighborhood so i rush to the front of the bus to ask if he goes to my neighborhood. The driver says he just goes anywhere so then we’re on the way to my house without me having to tell him directions. Also the bus turned into a car and theres no more students. We approach my house but he’s not stopping so i jump out into the random pile of snow by the house and go inside. [brother] did something but i cant remember what it was now, mom shows us random papers and then asks us “what should we DO” so then i open this green little notebook i have that barely had anything written on it. The only thing i remember reading rn is “work more well” or something like that.

I then come down and somehow the dream changes a bit and I am able to have a conversation with the eagle and I tell her it was a privallege to have been in the nest with her and the babies. She says of course and maybe (my friend's name) can come too next time. I said maybe but he needs to be ready to meet the family slowly to not scare the babies.

Why might this be happening and is this normal?

Next, I have super vivid dreams and I sometimes fall into lucid dreams and I try to fly.

Since i was 14 years old, i used to have this ""dream"" about someone who came to my bedroom and sat at the border of my bed. I couldn't what he looked like in my dreams. i only remember seeing two eyes staring at me and a black shadow surrounded him 
Now, looking back to this dream now, the only thing i used to see was his eyes. He used to kiss me gently in my bed, at that time, i thought it was just a ""dream"" however it was very vivid. That dream repeated at least 5 times and then stopped happening. 
2 years ago, i traveled to a town for work, it was my first time being alone in a hotel, i was very tired. when i slept that night, i felt the presence of someone in my bedroom, someone was hugging me while i was sleeping. It was so vivid, then he started kissing me, and touching me. it wasn't rude. After this, he got up of the bed (i remember this so clearly), and he practically run of my bedroom (i couldn't see what he looked like). i wanted to follow him, but i felt like something heavy was at my body and i couldn't move. I blinked and i was lying in my bed (the bed looked like it have been moved) and i was unsure if this was only a dream or if was real. i was really frightened of someone had broken into my room. I checked the bedroom's bolt and it was ok. i didn't sleep well after that ""dream"".
the last month, i had the same dream (someone hugging me and then kissing me, etc), but i decided to touched his back and it wasn't there. i mean, i could touch his face and his hair but when i was trying to touch other things apart from that, it wasn't there. like he couldn't have a physical body or a definite shape apart from his face. then i saw him running of my bedroom in form of a black shadow of a tall male.

The most notable time i was visiting an aunt and uncle who live 2 hours away from myself, i was riding in their car and they had been talking about some new building under construction we had just passed and i remember sitting up as i knew exactly what my aunt was about to say word for word just like in a dream i'd previously had ""i think it's going to be a **** mall"" and at that moment it fully rendered in my mind like holy **** i knew exactly word for word what she was about to say. this all being said it's been probably a year or more since i've had a moment in my life that's clicked like what i've described now a days the only dreams i remember are more like nightmares reoccurring one's as well, aliens coming down from saucers in the farm fields behind my house or the world turning to fire all around where my family and i all burn to death. Horrible dreams that terrify me to no end. Is there any way to maybe turn dreams around? maybe saying a prayer or something before bed? what works for everyone else? do you have these weird dreams where you see either a still moment in time or on occasion remember a conversation you've already either had or heard? please tell me i'm not insane! thanks in advance!",2023-01-29 21:31:53,1771,True

Anyone else had dreams like this?,"I kept waking up gasping for breath or like I was breathing really heavy. In the dream, I kept walking and crying or finding a place where I could be alone to cry. It felt so good. I separated from my family years ago, and in this dream, I was with them again at Thanksgiving dinner and everything was dark. None of the lights worked, etc. My mother was there. She had a new car and smart phone and wore all black and I couldn't see her face maybe because I was afraid of her. My mother never reported my father for abusing me even after I told her when I was like 3 years old. She abandoned me and told me to be quiet or she was going to throw me out on the street where I would starve. That wasn't in the dream. That was real life. Then I was at this dinosaur theme park like a real jurassic park and batman an catwoman were there and it felt like a cause for celebration because they had all been off the grid for a long time and I wanted to say something negative, but couldn't. I was so happy. I was limping and crying and so elated to see all of these huge dinosaurs and people like batman and catwoman to make sure we were all safe. I kept running in the snow to find a bush to crouch don't behind so I couldn't be seen crying. I could feel the tears running down my face and my chest caving in as this deep healing sobbing was taking place and i kept waking up and gasping and falling back to sleep to continue crying. Such a powerful dream. I was crying last night with a phone worker on a support hotline and I told her in all my confusion why I thought I was so emotional and she totally got me and that made me cry. I didn't have to explain and I felt safe with her because she was strong enough to hold space for me while I talked and expressed myself. Saved my life.

715,Dreams,Drøm error?,"Did anyone experience what seems to be an error in a dream?  Something that was not supposed to happen and that destroyed the dream? I had this just now and it feels like I experienced a program error that made the dream go wild and I ended waking up, breathing heavily.

Here is the dream: I was in my car driving somewhere together with my wife. It was pretty realistic and I could see the landscape and even remember some road signs. It was in the countryside and August-like weather, sunny, hot and beautiful although a bit dry.
We were late for where we were supposed to be but not a huge problem. We didn't know the way and discussed where to turn and so on. (No gps for some reason).
We passed a sign pointing to a town called something quite short (around 5 letters) which also had a drawing which I found significant: something in between an air sock and a hot air balloon. A bit blurry with broad white and red stripes. 
It seemed that we had to do a long detour in order to get to our destination so we tried what looked like a shortcut. A small road that wasn't paved and looked unofficial. After driving through some scattered trees it opened up into a field where there was cattle and a tourist here and there. Some natural park. We carried on even though we had the feeling that we weren't supposed to drive there. And maybe even should pay for being there.
At some point there wasn't a road anymore and the car couldn't go further. Luckily I had my bicycle and my wife sat behind as I continued further on. It went well an everything was nice. Even uphill I enjoyed how well the bicycle was going.
Then we came to a fence. It was locked, but we examined it a bit and found out that we could squeeze through and get the bicycle with us. 
On the other side we found ourselves standing by a regular road. It was at a 90 degrees turn and slowly it dawned on us that we had been there not long ago when we were driving by car.
We continue and we see the same odd sign with the wind sock/balloon and we pass by some 1800-something buildings named some person's last name plus ""resistance factory"" (Modstandsfabrik in Danish).
And here it goes crazy.
Suddenly I see fast changing pictures in my mind. Many pictures. New pictures pop up in front and the older ones fade to the background and the sides so that they are still partly visible. They change so fast that I can see what is on most of them but some of them are there too short time for me to understand what is on them. I guess around 3-5 pictures per second, but not sure. All photos look like they were taken in 1800 something.
People, machines, buildings, statues and maybe newspaper pages also. Historical photos? 
I begin to wake up and I feel my eyes moving from side to side and are a bit sore. I try to hold on because I find it interesting but I'm almost out of breath (in reality) like I just ran very fast and cannot help waking up. On my way to waking up I jump back to where I am driving the bicycle with my wife and its summer and cosy and nice. Then I'm awake.

I wonder what this resistance factory was all about and this explosion of images. And why was I breathing so heavily? It wasn't really scary or chocking. If felt like something that was an error in the dream. But on the other hand there was some connection in that we saw this road sign and the factory had a name and it was not random images.

716,Dreams,Reoccurring dream,"Every few months I have this dream out of no where. It’s a different location everytime, but it’s my papa coming to see me in real life. He died in 2014 when I was 15. My last dream, I was leaned against my car in a grocery store parking lot and my papa walks up to me, and I cry and hug him and don’t let go. I tell him how much I miss him and try to fill him in on what’s happened in my life over the years growing up. It’s always a short time. We laugh, smile, cry.. after some time he tells me it’s time for him to go again.. so I hug him one last time and just cry my eyes out, tell him I love him and he disappears.

717,Dreams,I had a dream that I was harassed by a demon.,"(Sorry, english is not my firts language).

I was trying to sleep, but he kept hugging, stoping me from moving and putting his hands on my body, on my breats. I was shocked, asking him to stop, to let me go. I tried do invoke satan, most powerful demon, to stop him, I got it one time, but he started it again later. At some time I could not move any way, like a sleep paralysis.

I ran to my mom's bedroom, ansking her to help me, while I held the door so him could not enter. We tried to invoke satan, but he were not responding. The demon tried to fool me to get into the room, saying i forgot my pillows, but I did not believed him.

I had fear, but did not felt the anguish I normally have on my nightmares (which I have a lot). I was more of scared because of being touched and glued on while I could do nothing. He was invisible all the time.",2023-01-29 18:47:51,849,True

A very sad clown in a grey, abandoned circus, and I walk around crying some massive tears
Except those tears are my own blood
As I wander around I find a malnourished lion, you can see it's bones through its skin.
It jumps at me and begins tearing me open
I don't even flinch

720,Dreams,Story about a dream my roommate had.,"(I hope this doesn't break any kind of rules for the subreddit because only the end of it is about the dream directly, I just wanted to give all needed info) 
So, today I was tryna annoy my roommate by giving him hints about him being in a coma. 
When sending him a message I put something like: Sir you've been sleeping for 28 years and your wife is dying, she wants to talk to you one last time. Into the middle of the text for no reason or with no context. 
I was making some jokes about this here and there throughout the entire day. 
When he was half asleep I was silently talking to him for minutes like if I was the doctor trying to wake him up. 
I made up some stories and stuff about how the doctor knew him before he got into the coma at 8 and how he was an amazing person. 
I also told him about how the doctor promised him to one day, go to space with him together.
But sadly it's only possible with today's technology which he didn't get to experience. 
At the end I was literally crying (I have no idea how I cried so easily on command maybe my story was a bit too sad, or am I secretly good at something) 
After that he totally fell asleep and woke up like one or half an hour later from a weird dream. 
He didn't remember anything about what I said, he just told me about the dream. 
He was in a hospital with a doctor who had short black hair, he was on a hospital bed in a room with no windows, only seeing the man and some kind of light. 
He also remembered something about the man saying he would have to **** him if he didn't woke up. 
When talking to him I talked about how I would have had to take him off the thing's that kept him alive. 
I was instantly surprised, especially because he said for some time he actually questioned if what happened was real. 
After that I said sorry and stuff, and made another joke about the thing being real because I'm an awful person and I should rot in ****. 
Then he told me: so Im gonna die anyways? 
Weird considering at the very end of my story the doctor have moved on, and I (now actually me) told him about me only being something in his dream, based on the memories, voice, and personality of the doctor. 
And told him once he falls asleep this dream would end together with his life. 

Pretty creepy story, I would probably not forget this. Hope you had fun reading it if you see this.",2023-01-29 18:15:46,2355,True

726,Dreams,Girl I've never seen visited me for 3 nights,"This story is about 2-3 years old at this point. I'm 18 now, and this happened when I was just turning 16. I had just moved houses around a year before, and the house was brand new- no other people had lived in it previous. One night, I went to sleep, and I had a regular dream. I forgot what it was about, but at the very end of it, I got teleported into this bedroom. I remember everything about it- there was two desks with these big PCs on top. One was themed blue, and the other was obnoxiously bright pink. The walls were gray, and the bed was purple. There was also a minifridge in there, practically overflowing with brightly-colored drinks. There were a few posters too, and the only one I can recall was one of those cheap Nirvana posters that are everywhere. I was sitting at the blue desk, and there was a girl sitting at the pink one. She was super pale-- like her eyelashes and eyebrows were almost white. She had a couple freckles, and super dainty, pointy features. Her hair was a short pixie cut. I also remember she was super tall, like at least 6 feet. We were always playing games together on the PCs.

She would always turn to me at the end of our games, and say ""Thanks for playing, have a good day, sweetheart!"" right before my alarm would go off. I'm talking within SECONDS my alarm would be blaring in my ears to get up for school.

The weirdest part is, to me at least, that this same ending would happen for a full three days. On the last  day I had this dream, she turned to me again. We weren't playing games or anything this time, just facing each other in our chairs. She said, ""Thank you for playing with me the past few days. I need you to come find me in real life. We have to meet each other in real life, okay?""  


I've never had that dream again. I've never seen this girl in real life either, but I have a feeling that when I do, it's going to change my life in one way or another. Has anyone else had a similar experience?",2023-01-29 16:07:27,1962,True

It didn't bother them,  and I could not figure out how they got in my house, or why there were so many of them. They were black with black and white tail feathers... actually really beautiful . 

2. Someone was trying to get in my front door, so I hid around a corner,  and it was a big brown horse... just waddled right past me with not a care in the world right into my living room . 

3. Man came in behind the horse,  I shot him several times with a shot gun,  but he wouldn't die, and wasn't injured

4. I had a vantage-point hiding spot upstairs where I could  point my gun at the front door and no one could see me.... but as I'm holed up some little boy comes up and starts vacuuming and gives away my location.

731,Dreams,"""Stuck in a loop"" dream","Has anyone ever dreamed you woke up, but you didn't? And then your dream starts looping as if you've woken up again, but you still haven't? I've only had this kind of dream a handful of times in my life, and every time it's horrifying. I just woke from one after taking a 1hr nap on the couch and I'm shaking as I type this. Would love if someone with similar experiences wanted to talk with me about this.

At first your eyes are just heavy and you're trying to open them, but you can't. You keep seeing the same image that you would see if you woke up for real. For me, it was my foot (covered in a blanket), my cat, and my electric fireplace (which is on).

You try to move. It's really hard. But eventually, after a few loops of closing your eyes and ""starting over"", you maybe manage to move a leg and you're like ""Great, I'm awake for real, I felt my foot hit the floor.""

Nope.

I went through dozens, maybe even more than a hundred loops. Each time I could move a little more. Usually my eyes were very hard to open and once I got them open a little, I knew that things would ""reset"" if I tried to close and open them again.

After actually getting off the couch (I threw myself off and bashed my shoulder into my living room table over and over. I felt it every time) I started getting up and walking around. Sometimes I made it further than others.

Finally, I started being able to see more of my house. I felt like I was jumping through different realities. In one, our kitchen was beautiful and recently redone (and also much larger). In another, my parents lived in my house with me. They came running down when I started screaming for help. In every successive loop after I first started yelling, I kept going. Kept calling for help. It started out as just a croak, but then kept getting progressively louder until I was yelling every time. In one loop, my dad was watching TV on the opposite when I ""woke up"". He was started by my pleading for help and kept asking me what was wrong. I think this was the last one before I got up for real.

I finally woke up just now. I'm exhausted. My brain feels wrung out.",2023-01-29 15:41:34,2125,True
732,Dreams,Having dreams about traumatic events,"Normally, my dreams are already pretty traumatic (mostly when I'm pmsing), but I've recently started taking an SSRI and they seem to be a lot more frequent. 

Just last night, I had the same dream multiple times (very slight differences) where I was at a hospital with my brother and it had multiple shootings. In some of the dreams he got shot but in others it was mostly strangers or no one. 

The other night I had a dream that my dogs got out of the house and I found out that the vet decided to put all 3 of them down for no particular reason. I'm unsure why, but that dream had more of an impact on me than the others. I was sobbing uncontrollably for hours and could actually feel the pain in my heart. 

A week or 2 ago, I had a dream that I went to a private all-girls school where the teachers forced us to have **** with them.

733,Dreams,I've spent a decade visiting people in their dreams and making sure they die peacefully.,"Hey guys,

I'm turning 27 soon and ever since I was 15, I've had dreams of being sent to someone and making sure they die peacefully and not in pain.

They have all been very graphic and felt very real and I could feel/smell everything and still remember them to this day. 

Each one of these dreams - Itd be someone who was going through an incredibly traumatic death (like, their limbs have been cut off in combat, or their Dad committed suicide, people being burnt alive - mostly people dying during wars) Sometimes I dream I'm the person dying and I feel the pain of being stabbed or being shot.

But, I know myself, that I will die peacefully at my desk while writing something. 

I don't know if it's a manifestation of schizophrenia but I wish these dreams will stop. Especially since my Mum has been diagnosed with terminal illness and I always hear **** knocking on the door and I always tell him its too soon. 

The first dream was a woman being burnt alive by a man and I had to watch her going away because I was just helplesssly hovering over her. She said she wanted me there because she wanted someone to know what had happened to her. After he left, she was still alive and asked me to make sure her case gets solved. It was an Asian woman and she died in a rural Southern state and that's all I remember.

The most traumatic one was being stationed in Thailand during a civil war and this man with infected decapitated wounds was dying and he knew he was going to die right there. He spent his last minutes telling me about my future and we were joking and laughing - and I just held him close and he left during a deep sleep. 

The most recent one was a man in Afghanistan who committed suicide. I joined him and his daughter on a trek up the mountains and had to convince him not to do it. I left when he committed suicide and joined his daughter up to the point she told her younger siblings, up until I had the faith to know she will be fine. 

I'm your average mid 20s YoPro who's obsessed with skincare and makeup and preoccupied with dating. But as a kid, I always dreamt about being part of Doctors Without Borders and maybe that's why my dreams are presenting like this, however I've given up on that career. 

I don't know if I have a mental disorder but I do believe in a spiritual world, mainly because of how vivid my dreams are. I guess, the main thing to take away from this is that Noone ever truly dies alone. Maybe **** assigns jobs to living people like myself and sends them to others to make sure they die peacefully and make it home.",2023-01-29 14:53:40,2572,True

735,Dreams,My dream characters started ignoring me after I told them I recognised them,"Hi there, this is my first time posting and I’m word vomiting whilst I can still remember what happened. I want to know if anyone’s ever experienced something similar. 

After work this morning I came home and got really sleepy. I fell asleep on the couch and I remember it started off in a pub. The scene plays out and once it got to me leaving the pub I start to realise I’ve dreamt this before. The next scene starts and I’m in another location, it was an urban building and this scene was bright with lots of white walls, there are lots of people and I’m walking towards a group.  They’re talking and laughing, the girl looks up at me and says “don’t I know you from somewhere?”
Now in my old dream this doesn’t happen, last time she asked me what took me so long and for me to come with them. 

So I replied back “yeah wait I recognise you”. She looks down quickly and looks at the other person to my right and then they start ignoring me.. 
the scenes play out how I remember, same places, same order and it’s not like they’re running away, I’m always where I’m supposed to be except they don’t talk directly to me and if I try talking to them it’s as if I’m not there.

737,Dreams,i had a lucid dream that i cant stop thinking about,"TW: child loss

so today i fell asleep at work. all of my duties were 
done so i had anout an hour break and slep for around 30 minutes of it. i dont know what triggered this lucid dream. its also important to note that i barely ever remember my dreams in this much detail, usually just the main idea of it. but heres how it went:

i woke up in a beautiful bedroom. the color scheme being red and gold. there was a lovely fireplace and two chairs near it. i was sleeping on a window seat with expensive feeling fabric. as im looking around confused, i hear a voice. ""good morning, baby""
i look up and see my boyfriend sitting in one of the chairs facing me. ""where are we??"" i asked.
""we're home.""
""no, we are definitely not!""
""this is your dream world. this is our home here. go ahead and have a look around.""
i jump up from my seat and frantically look around. i frequently have hallucinations in real life, so i did not trust this version of my boyfriend.
""youre not my E!""
""just go have a look around. ill be right here when you come back.""
so i decided to have a look. my curiosity won. as im walking down this long hall lined with closed doors i see the kitchen, the dining room, and finally, under the table, my cat Precious. she passed away a few years ago and ive missed her everyday since then and with her were the two kittens my boyfriend and i got together that passed away due to genetic liver failure. the more i looked around the more passed pets and loved ones i saw. they were all here. alive and happy and thriving.
but i think the best thing of all is that my daughter was there. across from our bedroom was a door. i saw light coming from inside, so i opened it slowly. i peeked inside and saw a white and pink bed, loads of toys, a baby pink fuzzy rug with little bears on it, and, in the middle of the rug, a little girl. she had her back turned to me and was playing with her dolls. she had long dark brown hair and she looked to be about 7 years of age. 
""V?"" i asked with a shaky, barely audible voice.
the girl whipped around and stared at me with wide green eyes. ""Mommy!"" she yelled as she jumped up and ran to wrap her arms around me, abandoning her dolls on the floor.
She looked up at me without letting go of my waist, ""I missed you."" 

i miscarried my daughter at 27 weeks. i never got to meet her, hold her, tell her i love her. the dream ended abruptly, but my waking didnt, as if i was trying desperately to cling to that world. to my baby.

i havent been able to stop thinking about it since, i want to go back. i want my daughter. my pets. my home. i want to know what or who was behind the other doors. i want my world back.",2023-01-29 14:19:13,2664,True
739,Dreams,Does my recurring romance dream have meaning?,"Hi everyone :) so for maybe 3-4 years I’ve (f23) been having romantic dreams of the same guy I knew in high school over and over again. We had classes together and would talk there but weren’t ever super close, although we had really easy conversations. And now I haven’t seen him at all since graduation years ago. The dreams are different flavors but all with the same tone of romance. They’re also close to lucid dreams, the kind where it feels like I’m living life right there in that moment. I’m wondering what y’all might think this means, if anything. Do you believe in the spiritual connection, are we connected in some cosmic way? Does this mean he might also be having dreams about me in this way, too, if there is such a thing? Should I do anything about the dreams I’m having or just leave them be? I like having them honestly so I don’t want to get rid of them but I’m curious what everyone thinks, as I don’t know a lot about this stuff. And tbh I feel connected to him now even if none of it means anything so I just… idk, I’m curious",2023-01-29 14:06:44,1049,True
740,Dreams,Dimension hopping reality shattering wild ride,"Last night I was taken on an out of control wild ride through some form of “multiverse” that I almost didn’t make it through with sanity intact… and I think it was my fault. 

It all started with a sleep paralysis episode. I’ve had them before but it’s been while. That feeling of dark shadowing “otherness” pervaded the room but I managed to break it relatively quickly by trying to rapidly tap my fiancés thigh and also praying for help (to no deity in particular). 

I was able to fall back asleep and was immediately in a deep lucid dream. As always when lucid, I chose to fly. But this time it was far more powerful and fast and I barely had a grip on the feel of controlling it. I was flying faster than the dreamscape could manifest itself. This obviously was extremely exhilarating and empowering and, as I often do while lucid, felt invincible. 

That when I got an idea that would take this to a whole new level. “What’s beyond even this? Let’s go deeper, let’s break the code!”

And so I flew straight into and through the ground into darkness. What happened next is hard to describe and I’m still putting the pieces together.

It started out easy enough to understand. I was experiencing stable slices of my life in what must be different realities. At the grocery store buying yogurt with my fiancé, at the movies with her, at a bar, hiking and swimming, each scene shifting into the other rather smoothly. I should say that time passing didn’t have that weird dreamlike quality but rather every minute was a felt experienced minute. Hours passed. Also, my fiancé was the constant element that was there 95% of the time. 

Then it started to speed up and complexity. The reality shifts grew quicker and more jarring, giving me less time to comprehend and react appropriately to the found situations. It started with making simple, almost typical “man brain bonehead” mistakes. Trying to put my key into the door of the wrong car (fiancé is laughing like “****”), sitting in the wrong seat at the movies next to random people because she’s now up a few rows (fiancé is now more seriously like “****”), brushing with the wrong toothbrush. 

Then it got more serious. I found myself in the middle of fight and trying to not be stabbed, kissing the wrong girl that isn’t my partner, now I’m buying more yogurt and trying to explain to my fiancé that my single consciousness is being split between realities (she’s understanding in one slice, angry and resentful about me not being able to keep it together in another). As my single awareness moves through each slice I’m trying to explain this to her and/or my family and my sanity is being questioned, now people are angry at me for walking into the wrong house. 

Now as the speed exponentially increases, so does the divergence of similarity between slices. It’s gets jumbled here but now I’m a famous theater actor on stage dressed in a full suit of metal armor, now I’m at the park with my fiancé and kid (who in reality isn’t even conceived yet), now I’m surviving alone on a deserted island and haven’t seen a human in so long I’ve forgotten the sound of my own voice, now my fiancé is breaking up with me and taking our kid because I’ve thoroughly lost my mind, now I’m jumping off stage and punching a critic in the face with my armored fist because he didn’t like my last production titled “Thursday Night” and I scream in his face “I’LL PUT MY THUSRDAY IN YOUR NIGHT” (I should say I’ve only been to a couple plays in my entire life), now I’m being abducted by aliens, now I’m back surviving on the island frustrated at how annoying it is to open coconuts without proper tools. 


I wake up in my bed but it’s a dream bed, I’ve been stabbed and am bleeding out, I’m fishing with my Dad, now my fiancé is saying it’s okay and she understands my insanity, I wake up in the dream bed again, I’ve been institutionalized for psychosis, I’m playing with my child, wake up in dream bed and try to tell fiancé that my sense of reality has been shattered and I need help… this goes on and on.

741,Dreams,Dimension hopping reality shattering wild ride,"Last night I was taken on an out of control wild ride through some form of “multiverse” that I almost didn’t make it through with sanity intact… and I think it was my fault. 

It all started with a sleep paralysis episode. I’ve had them before but it’s been while. That feeling of dark shadowing “otherness” pervaded the room but I managed to break it relatively quickly by trying to rapidly tap my fiancés thigh and also praying for help (to no deity in particular). 

I was able to fall back asleep and was immediately in a deep lucid dream. As always when lucid, I chose to fly. But this time it was far more powerful and fast and I barely had a grip on the feel of controlling it. I was flying faster than the dreamscape could manifest itself. This obviously was extremely exhilarating and empowering and, as I often do while lucid, felt invincible. 

That when I got an idea that would take this to a whole new level. “What’s beyond even this? Let’s go deeper, let’s break the code!”

And so I flew straight into and through the ground into darkness. What happened next is hard to describe and I’m still putting the pieces together.

It started out easy enough to understand. I was experiencing stable slices of my life in what must be different realities. At the grocery store buying yogurt with my fiancé, at the movies with her, at a bar, hiking and swimming, each scene shifting into the other rather smoothly. I should say that time passing didn’t have that weird dreamlike quality but rather every minute was a felt experienced minute. Hours passed. Also, my fiancé was the constant element that was there 95% of the time. 

Then it started to speed up and complexity. The reality shifts grew quicker and more jarring, giving me less time to comprehend and react appropriately to the found situations. It started with making simple, almost typical “man brain bonehead” mistakes. Trying to put my key into the door of the wrong car (fiancé is laughing like “****”), sitting in the wrong seat at the movies next to random people because she’s now up a few rows (fiancé is now more seriously like “****”), brushing with the wrong toothbrush. 

Then it got more serious. I found myself in the middle of fight and trying to not be stabbed, kissing the wrong girl that isn’t my partner, now I’m buying more yogurt and trying to explain to my fiancé that my single consciousness is being split between realities (she’s understanding in one slice, angry and resentful about me not being able to keep it together in another). As my single awareness moves through each slice I’m trying to explain this to her and/or my family and my sanity is being questioned, now people are angry at me for walking into the wrong house. 

Now as the speed exponentially increases, so does the divergence of similarity between slices. It’s gets jumbled here but now I’m a famous theater actor on stage dressed in a full suit of metal armor, now I’m at the park with my fiancé and kid (who in reality isn’t even conceived yet), now I’m surviving alone on a deserted island and haven’t seen a human in so long I’ve forgotten the sound of my own voice, now my fiancé is breaking up with me and taking our kid because I’ve thoroughly lost my mind, now I’m jumping off stage and punching a critic in the face with my armored fist because he didn’t like my last production titled “Thursday Night” and I scream in his face “I’LL PUT MY THUSRDAY IN YOUR NIGHT” (I should say I’ve only been to a couple plays in my entire life), now I’m being abducted by aliens, now I’m back surviving on the island frustrated at how annoying it is to open coconuts without proper tools. 


I wake up in my bed but it’s a dream bed, I’ve been stabbed and am bleeding out, I’m fishing with my Dad, now my fiancé is saying it’s okay and she understands my insanity, I wake up in the dream bed again, I’ve been institutionalized for psychosis, I’m playing with my child, wake up in dream bed and try to tell fiancé that my sense of reality has been shattered and I need help… this goes on and on. 

Eventually I actually wake up. I can feel the normal feeling of base waking reality but can’t be too sure so I wake up my fiancé and ask her if this is real. She says yes of course and we snuggle until the sun rises but I’m too afraid to go back to sleep. Now I’m here writing this…",2023-01-29 13:45:26,4338,True
742,Dreams,23.01.29: My car key &amp; remote was also opening a nearby car,"2023-01-29

Short dream, not sure how to interpret it.

I have a BMW and looked like I was observing as it was lifted up and getting some fluids changed. When the oil change was done, I walked outside to the parking lot to pick it up (my oil change won't be until May/June since I barely drive, so might be an indicator of timing).

But when I opened the trunk with the key remote, both my BMW's trunk opened, as well as the trunk of the Audi next to it.

Unexpected, one or two other people came over to investigate with me.

We tried it again, and it looked like the remote was unlocking both cars.

Then I compared the keys, and could see they had slightly different teeth cuts.

But when I took my BMW key to the door lock on the Audi, it unlocked the car too.

It seemed like the manufacturer was using ""security through obscurity"", giving us the perception that these keys were unique and impenetrable.

But really they were mostly duplicates and anyone paying attention could see that the keys are swappable.

---

On a side note, my insurance is up for renewal, and this year the replacement value of my vehicle actually increased from last year. I was thinking it might actually be nice if it was totalled, then I could buy a newer model with the cash. Maybe a premonition that my BMW will be stolen.",2023-01-29 13:25:36,1309,True

It was so detailed. I thought of it today because I wanted to watch it again. I remember everything about the film but not how I watched it, laik if it was on my phone or something.

744,Dreams,A dream or something else?,"
I don’t know if something like this has happened to anyone? It’s been awhile since the last time it happened to me. 

I woke up in the middle of the night with a sense of dread. Like I wasn’t alone in my room. And then I had something like tunnel vision as if I was being **** and then I heard a muffled scream. 

When this happens to me I stay still, scared to move a muscle and debate on either turn on the light and go to bring my dog to sleep with me or pretend like nothing happened and keep sleeping. 

I’m always scared to turn on the light because in some dreams the lamp is dead and when that happens I know that whatever that is with me is aware of me and my movement and knows that the light brings me peace and makes me feel safe and it doesn’t want that. 

I ended up turning the light on and brought my dog to sleep with me and I guess I ended up falling asleep. 

I was lucky that what happened was short. Normally it last longer and it **** terrifies me. 

When I woke up I was unsure if I indeed turned the light on and went to get my dog but when I saw my dog on the carpet it downed on me that I was awake back then. 

I don’t know why it happens. I just hate it",2023-01-29 12:58:29,1182,True
746,Dreams,Dream about getting shot by a stranger,"Hey all, I just found this subreddit and wanted to mention a weird dream I had a few months ago. But first, some facts about me: I'm a young gamer who lives in the UK, and am housebound due to severe anxiety.  

Anyway, in this dream I don't know why but I was being pursued by a man with a handgun, a situation both very rare in the UK, and one I doubt I'd ever find myself in. Anyway I attempted to flee, and managed to jump over a few fences but he quickly caught up with me. I then heard and felt at least two gunshots hit me in the back, maybe more. I fell to the ground and I saw blood appear over my vision and the words **GAME OVER** like I was in a video game. I woke up afterwards and thought that was very weird, never had a dream before and never had another dream like it. I do play video games but I haven't played any games that involved seeing a game over screen in years, so I found this to be quite a peculiar dream/nightmare hybrid.",2023-01-29 12:40:37,951,True
747,Dreams,videos and photos of my deceased soulmate (reoccurring character),"This dream is messy because it clearly overlapped with another one so its hard to write down without making it sound like nonsense. I'm going to write them both down in one go.

My dream starts with me being very young, like 14-16 and we needing to go to a flea market in the kreade, an old community centre we used to go to, especially for the flea markets. My sisters and I were angry at my mom because we arrived at 6pm instead of the usual 9am. We went looking for toys and cameras and I found a silver Sony one with super zoom and an extendable flash that's waaaay cool. Like this thing could be extended up to a metre. Totally useless in hindsight. It wasn't digital though. Which was weird because the lady at the stall told me the wi-fi ones were more expensive, didn't have those in 2006 I was also interested in an unmarked film camera with a boxy design that reminded me of a canon range finder I personally own now that I think about it. Only it had weirdly digital features. Like it was made in the 50s but with 80s features. It was weird. I found a camera bag filled with unused film both 120 and 35. I remember being surprised finding it like it was under my bed or something. 

Then my soulmate pretty much showed up and the surrounding dream seemed to dissolve in to a blur. this is where the transition happened between dreams. We hanged outside where the kids used to play basket ball and near the skateboard ramps. She was a Japanese girl with short blackish brown hair. She was like 14-15 too and was wearing baggy pants with a red hoody with a yellow shirt underneath. We hugged and kissed a bit, and then she wanted me to take photos with the new camera. I told her I couldn't because I didn't have film, then she said to use my phone which I remembered could capture video, but it wasn't my old nokia I grabbed, it was a smartphone. And I didn't see myself taking the footage instead my dream cuts again, this time to me showing my mom and another lady my photos on another phone. She basically looked the same but had different clothes on. I had filmed her in the giant grass field next to the kreade and near some building I don't recognize. I do recognize one of the photos being the wall near my school though. In one photo my mom said, but you can see her shoulder is hurt, pointing to a bloody wound on her right shoulder. 

Then I woke up and as soon as I did my deceased soulmate who I channel told me she landed on her shoulder when the plane crashed and that she sent the dream to show herself more to me.",2023-01-29 12:40:00,2539,True
748,Dreams,I had a dream about robot mimes.,"So I'm trying to figure out what this all means, essentially I had a dream that I was turned into a (feminine) cyborg mime and was thrown into a group of several other (feminine) cyborg mimes. We had a new addition and she was really nervous and quiet (more quiet than your average mime) so I decided to help her out. Her and I slipped out of everyone else's view, under an airplane. She was having touble with lighting her little flame. All of us had a small hole in our stomach where we were to stick a lighter in, then light a little flame. She ended up lighting herself on fire accidentally. So I told her I'd help her and ended up pulling her into my arms and dancing with her, lighting her flame with my own. Like, her and I were slow dancing together. It was really quite strange. So I've got two questions from that which are, why do I romanticize mimes and what does my dream mean?

TL;DR I had a dream about lesbian robot mimes and I'm trying to figure out what it means.",2023-01-29 12:30:42,981,True
749,Dreams,(TW)multiple dreams about dying animals and abuse,"So I'd love if anyone had some thoughts/interpretation of a couple dreams I had this morning. 

The first was set in a kind of farmers market. Lots of people who I recognized as people I'd met in a group meetup thing I'm a part of in real life and there were some friends there too. After hanging out and getting vegetables, I saw puppies and decided to wander over to that. It was kind of a multiple tent setup. In one corner were puppies but for some reason they were taped together like a lot of duct tape in two groups of 3. I looked on in confusion and horror and kept walking until I saw a stall with mama dogs but they were chained in a way so that they were exposed on their sides so the puppies could drink milk. Again shock and horror and confusion. I kept going and saw cows. One perfectly fine and I gave her some scritches. I looked on and saw two others. The farmer standing there explained they were grade a premium whatever and went to get something (?). The cows were alive but had chunks taken off and had ""meat"" exposed like they were just like big parts of a chunk of meat. No blood, no organs, no separation of muscles. I was thr most shocked by that but in my mind who was I to come and tell a farmer how to raise his animals. I don't know it was horrible. 

Next dream: I had small chicks of some sort and they wanted to run around on my bed but I couldn't see them well so I needed to put them back in their bag and turn a light on. I did that and turn back to them and one I deduced was overheating in this bag and took it out and brought it outside to cool down. Trying to revive it I thought to myself I don't care if this is a dream i have to save this animal. Woke up before knowing if I had revived it.

Things to note, between the dreams I started a lucid dreaming meditation on youtube that I *thought* didn't work so I turned off midway through. I'm also pretty spiritual and have been working to develop my abilities and work on myself. I've also had covid for 2 weeks now (I'm not like sick anymore but I keep testing positive so I've been stuck in my bedroom and at home for waaaay too long). I'm going back to work in about a week after having 7 weeks off and there's some uncertainty around whether I'll be in the same position or get the promotion I've been angling for for some time now. I also love animals often more than people and I think a lot about getting involved in the spca and helping animals suffering abuse/ neglect. 

Thank you for reading all this if you had i would love your thoughts.

TL/DR: I had a few separate dreams about animals dying and being abused and don't know what the **** to make of it.",2023-01-29 12:24:07,2658,True
750,Dreams,"Holy Shit, had a brutal dream last night.","Hi this is my first time on here but I felt like I wanted to share.

It started out as I was applying to Cal Poly **** for some reason

I aced the SAT and ACTs and I wrote a great essay

when the day came, the school gathered everyone who applied in a circle and slowly named off the names of who got accepted.

The names wore down slowly and more slowly, I began to worry as the last few names were called.

Then it was only me, only me. At that point I had a full panic mode and as the official was leaving I ran up to him and asked him why was I not accepted.

He brought me up to his office and showed me the results.

I was the only person not accepted in a total of 20 years.

At that point I began melting down and the official began ridiculing me and so did all of the other staff members.

I looked down below my classmates and my friends were also ridiculing me in all of the same monotone. Everything began blending in as one and I desperately tried to change my results by trying to hijack the officials computer. He slapped me and declared I was never going to get into a college and I was to die like a little ****. At this point I pulled out a gun from my pants and I shot everyone in the office and then I committed suicide by jumping 40 feet from the air.

Then I woke up.",2023-01-29 12:10:50,1289,True

What stands out the most was his perfect smile, his warm hug and the T-shirt I remember him wearing the most. He also mentioned a memory with my 2 bothers. It felt more like he was visiting me to let me know he was happy/ok and that he was proud of me and wanted me to let my brothers know as well.

Is this because I can't accept something deep down?

I haven't shed even a single tear since the relationship ended. We didn't fight much and loved each other more than anything. But I think my brain buried all the pain away.

757,Dreams,I was Spider-Man and had to face a demon invasion in a foreign university. Could this mean something or is it just a weird recollection of things?,"I don’t remember where exactly this university was, but it was somewhere in the Middle East I think. 

Anyway, I was Spider-Man and I was swinging across town to get to the university while I saw a couple eating pizza at a restaurant. Then I got to the university and I had to use some type of app to find a roommate. I’d already asked a friend to be a roommate but he ended up declining because I wasn’t “supernatural” enough so I started looking for a new roommate in the app.

While I was waiting, the demons from Doom started invading college so I had to fight them because I was Spider-Man. Also during that time the pizza guy (who was also at school) became Daredevil after consuming a berserk pack from Doom but he went insane and started to want to **** everyone so his girlfriend had to calm him down. The invasion was now over and my roommate arrived and he seemed pretty chill (I also suspected he was someone I’d met on Twitter for some reason). 

Then the next day we had lunch but before that I went to a parking spot below the university to meet my family who had brought me an old philosophy book with a cloth cover and some ink spots. I ended up trading it for a blue Diary of a Wimpy Kid book which had a lot of swear words. 

While reading the book I started getting extremely tired and wanted to fall asleep so I opened Reddit on my phone to prevent that.

That night a lot of classmates including me started sneaking out and chatting about Star Wars Clone Wars but we were heading towards a secret Donald Trump club where his followers hung out

In the Trump club one of us disguised as Obama and we told security that we wanted to talk to trump but then the real Obama entered and we were kicked out.

763,Dreams,multiple dreams of dying all night just now,"i just woke up from the loudest explosion i’ve ever heard and felt. but it’s been a chain of nightmares all night where i end up dying and that was the last one.

my first nightmare:
i had just graduated and was looking for a new home to move into and kept running into people i’ve known all my life in real life. but all along the way i had been discovering body parts buried in the ground.
 i found a small 1-story apartment i wanted to stay in and moved in simply by just walking in. i noticed everything was already set up and ignore it and lay down on the bed and invite my boyfriend over and he decides to spent the night with me.
we’re planning our night and i hear someone open my front door. it’s a man yelling saying he knows there’s someone inside and he’s not here to hurt anyone he just wants to sort things out. i tell my bf to hide in the closet just to be safe in case anything happens and i’ll be right back and i say “i’m so sorry, i’m in the bedroom” which is unusual for me since i’m a very safe person. anyways, i wait for the man to come toward the room. he comes, opens the door, and tries to make sweet talk about how he never expected such a pretty face to take over his apartment anytime soon, but that he wasn’t ready to move out yet. and just as i’m about to call my boyfriend out, the man walks over to lock the bedroom door and pulls a gun on me and he makes me undress myself for him and then r-words me. after it’s done i look over to the closet door sobbing only to see nobody in there, just my boyfriend over me telling me he’s so sorry for doing this to me and the cold barrel meets my head and i’m in my next dream.

second nightmare:
i was at a school event as a 6th grader all over again and we were having a scavenger hunt with the whole grade divided up into small groups and whoever won got some really cool prize.
after the entire scavenger hunt had passed, my group realizes we’re going to win. we look for the teacher in charge of the scavenger hunt, but we’re on this complex amusement park-like grounds that it’s hard to regroup. it took us so long to find our teacher that some other group had claimed the prize. 
it was a concert on a small grassy lot with these super steep 20 foot hills all around you couldn’t climb over to watch. we wait outside for the concert to be done but hear panic and everyone starts climbing these hills to enter. people are climbing and falling back down because it’s so hard to cling onto. i make it over and hear screams behind me but just enter the show area and the music stops and you hear are screams and loud bangs. i look behind me toward the hills and bodies around me start dropping dead and i’m standing there frozen unable to process what to do. then i fall over too clenching my head trying to figure out what could’ve caused this massive headache only to look at my hands and see blood. i lay on the grass staring up to see a shooting star only to see it land next to me and a ticking noise. then i’m transported to my next dream.

my third nightmare:
i was in a shopping plaza with my entire family, mom, dad, brother, and newborn baby sister. they’re grabbing smoothies and fruit cups meanwhile i check out a new clothing store that had just opened. it’s a dimly lit environment with only a few racks of clothing in the entire store. i manage to look through them all and decide there’s nothing of my interest.
i head out to see everyone in panic telling me to look for cover. a man in a convertible points a small pistol at me and says not to worry, he’s got us covered but that there’s a gun threat. he says he’s there to protect us and i hear someone call me across the smoothie shop counters and i’m pulled over and i see my family hiding with the vendors.
my mom hands me my sister to tell her bye if anything happens. i say nothing will happen but my brother decides it might be best to put my sister in a secure fruit drawer. we set her inside and the man from earlier with a pistol asks if we know the gunman and i say no of course not and he smiles at me and tells me not to trust people so easily. he kills everyone inside and points the gun at me and i’m in my next dream.

my last nightmare:
i’m shopping in a clearance section of a giant store and after a half hour of only finding 3 things, i go to check out. i walk past some overalls for snow i’ve been needing and check the price tag and it’s way too much. so i make a last trip around the store and hear a snobby girl talking about how half the people in here shouldn’t even be inside because they can’t afford it unlike herself. i roll my eyes and continue walking.
as i’m about to pay, the snobby girl puts her warm jacket over my bare shoulders and i thank her because ive been so cold. she looks me up and down and says “what-everrruh” and smacks on her gum and continues texting. that made me realize she’s just using me as a coat rack so she can use her phone. i notice a small quiet girl forms in the line behind the snobby girl. she’s looking around panicked and twitchy.
i turn to tap my card to pay and i hear a loud thud and as i’m turning around my left shoulder i’m blinded and deafened on that side and i only process a bright white image and my ears are ringing super loudly realizing i had just been bombed.

i wake up super quickly feeling exhausted like someone had been sitting on my chest all night. my left ear felt extremely muffled but it takes me a more to realize it had only been my dreams’ effects.

what do these mean? i always have nightmares every night since early childhood. i’m 19",2023-01-29 09:12:05,5575,True
764,Dreams,the most disturbing dream i’ve had,"hello everyone i’m here to talk about this dream? nightmare? that i just had. now i’ve had some pretty gruesome nightmares but nothing has been more gut wrenching than this one i just had a few minutes ago 

in my dream, i was in a foreign country along with a few of my other friends and i’ve been texting and calling my mom throughout the trip. 
TRIGGER WARNING THIS IS THE DISTURBING PART 
but while im in the shower she facetimes hysterical and she flips the camera to show herself over a bath tub with her blood dripping into it. then i began to see flashes of her head being submerged under water. then her thrashing around with my brother holding her…..

im gonna give a bit of context so maybe people will understand how this nightmare came about. my brother (who appeared holding my mom in the dream) is currently in jail. he’s in there suffering as a result of someone else’s actions…. this hit my entire family pretty hard given the nature of the crime and the expenses for his case have been absolutely insane. my mom is a single mom. the job she working could barely pay for my college expenses, the house bills, and literally anything else. She lost her job about two days ago and last night she texted me that she would probably “disappear for a couple months”. 

i’m constantly worried about my mother’s mental state and things only seem to be getting worse for her and i honestly don’t know what she’s capable of doing if pushed too far.

766,Dreams,bubble tea from a court house and blue hippo tang (dory fish),"The first dream,  I got bubble tea that was being sold at my local court house.  I stood in the crossroads in front of the courthouse and seeped a tea bag in the cup.  I used instructions with pictures to know how long to seep the tea.  The color was a dark, unsaturated  purple. I don't like tea and didn't really expect to like it,  but it was actually nice and sweet. The drink was both hot and cold, as if hot tea had been poured over ice.  I thought there was not a lot of boba for this to be bubble tea, but then I drank one bubble.  

In another dream, I'm looking at a a fish tank.  I notice that there are salt water fish in a fresh water tank. The salt water fish were blue hippo tang,  the fish Dory is, but in the dream I mistake their name for Moorish Idols. The fish aren't doing well as they are in the wrong water. I ask a caretaker about it, thinking she would move them,  but she puts salt in the water.  Now I'm worried about the freshwater fish,  but they seem to be okay.  The salt water fish are still not doing okay.  She put more salt that sunk to the bottom.  Now there is only one salt water tang left (the others vanished) and it swam to the salt so it could breath better.  There was a disturbance in the water,  and bubbles began to move like a tornado. It got chaotic by I don't really remember the rest.",2023-01-29 08:40:50,1334,True

769,Dreams,Recurring dream about neglected tank pet,"Hi everyone,

I’ve had almost this recurring dream since I was in high school (currently 23F.) The dream consists of me stumbling upon a neglected pet tank (it used to be fish, now it’s usually a snake or other reptile) that apparently I haven’t cared for in months-years. The tank is always filthy and the pets are half dead and emaciated. It fills me with guilt and sorrow. In the dream, I try to find a way to care for these pets or bring them to a veterinarian but I wake up before I can do that. When I wake up, I feel extremely relieved that I don’t even own fish or reptiles and my 2 cats (my babies) are doing just fine. I can’t describe the extreme guilt I feel after having this dream. **** does this mean?

For context, I suffer from anxiety and an eating disorder. As of the last 3 years I am a registered nurse who is responsible for taking care of others. 

I was searching Reddit and I found that this recurring tank neglect dream is common with other people as well.",2023-01-29 08:15:38,982,True

And they eventually got sued and shut down because of a crypto scam. I think they had NFTs and cryptocurrency and their company was shut down because of it.

Then I had another dream about a pool which taught you how to swim and there was a nice guy there with me and I saw a lot of nice people there about 20 or so walking past me.

And then I had a dream about losing a coat at a university and I went to go find it and didn't find it.

772,Dreams,Insanely vivid dream - help with interpretation please.,"I dreamt I was outside in green fields on the edge of a town, with red brick houses near a road. I never fly well in dreams, but in this one I seemed to be able to take large jumps, then slowly float back to earth. This went on for some time with me jumping over the road or from one side of a field to the other.

Suddenly I felt an immense force lifting me.  It felt connected to my core and began to pull me away. I felt the most tremendous sense of acceleration. Forests, towns, cities and fields all seemed to fly by in an increasing blur.

I slowly began to become aware of my new surroundings and realised I was in my childhood bedroom.  Near the desk was a Zoltan machine. I placed a coin in it. The machine spat out two pieces of paper. I couldn't read the first, but the second said the words ""Hello hello hello"" in a dot matrix pattern.

I’m standing in front of my grandparents old house, it’s summer time and there’s a light breeze as I look over I notice my grandfather in a wheel chair rolling across the lawn. I think it can’t be him since he’s passed away but as he gets closer I realize it is him. I yell to him, he can’t hear me and keeps going. I run over to him and say “grandpa?” He looks up and smiles. I hug him and say “grandpa you’re here your not gone?” We hug. He says “no I’m not here for long… just wanted to say I love you.” Then the dream faded away and I was riding a train through the mountains.

776,Dreams,I recently read ‘Tipping Point’ by Malcom Gladwell and it’s all I’ve been dreaming about. But the book is non fiction,"I hadn’t read a book in a while so I decided to pick up a random one from my shelf. Ever since I read Tipping Point- a sociology book about social epidemics- all of my dreams have been about it. 

I am subconsciously obsessed with Tipping Point to the point where it is all my brain will let me think about when I sleep. The book is non fiction though so I dream of percentages.

I keep dreaming about “the stickiness factor” and the “20 80 rule”. Gladwell organises people behind social epidemics into three categories. The mavens and the connectors and the salesmen. And they won’t leave me alone. 

I keep seeing crowds getting sorted and weird re-enactments and diagrams of Gladwell’s arguments like one where one person in a colourless crowd turns into a colour and it’s passed on and changed throughout the group and the further it is from the origin the more differently it changes. And then the Mavens and the Salesmen and the Connecters are highlighted to show their impact on the colour spread/change. 

Or the 150 rule and it’s a crowd of 150 people who are all green but then it adds more people and it all turns red because it’s unorganised until it’s split up and sorted into groups less than 150 instead of just one big group of over 150 and they’re green and happy again.

777,Dreams,my reflection killed me,"Disclamer: I'm someone who suffers from anxiety and depression, and waking up from my sleeps because of my loud heart palpitations has become the norm to me,
Anyway what happened is that I dreamt of being somewhere like a market where there was a lot of people and a lot of noise, I had a headache and tried to go out from there, but something was telling me to look back and so i did and that's when I saw her, my reflection not in a mirror or something, it was a humain being that looks like me but that have every trait that I despise in me, it' not our first encounter, i've met her many times and I always fear her and runaway from her, but this time it was different, i stayed where I was as if I wanted her to hurt me, and she looked sad something that I found strange, she took a gun out and pointed it out to me, and I just surrounded to her, not a scream nor a tear, i just stood there waiting for her and from all the noise that surrounded me i heard the gun shut and I saw the bullet in slow motion coming to me, when it reached my forehead, I felt it, I felt the pain in my head  and it started spreading all over my body. Once my whole body felt that pain I no longer heard the noise, it was very peaceful, the quietest it have ever been in two years, I opened my eyes to find my self drowning in the bottom of the ocean, i could see the light in the surface but I didn't want to reach it, I couldn't hear my heartbeats, but I didn't mind it, it was so peaceful and I didn't want to leave, suddenly I heard her, my voice saying it's not your time yet, don't leave them behind( my parents), I teared because I knew I couldn't stay there and I knew I had to go back I swam and swam to the surface and when I was about to go out I closed my eyes so I can get used to the light, and when I opened them this time I was in my room, sleeping on my bed with my heartbeat back to normal.

778,Dreams,My doppelganger tried to assasinate me.,"I’ve had such a blizzare dream last night and I just have to write it out somewhere because I can’t stop thinking about it.

Now, I’ve had my fair share of odd dreams ranging from not being able to wake up all while knowing that I’m dreaming to my dream leaking into reality when I have sleep paralysis etc. These things rarely shake me up because I am **** to them by now, but last night’s dream really, really creeped me out.

Throughout the whole dream my lookalike was actively hunting me in an attempt to assasinate me and I was actively running. It looked just like me, it was so uncanny. The way I dress, my hair, eyes, almost everything. But one thing that disturbed me most was the expression it had. There was something about that face that creeped me out to the core. It was calculated, cold and emotionless, soulless even. It was as if it had one goal and that was all that mattered. There was a weapon, a long knife which it used to attack me, but I ended up attacking it and actually slicing its wrist. I think I managed to escape before I woke up.

Is this my brain subconsciously sending me signals that something’s wrong? A bad habbit maybe? Fear of something? I’ve no idea. I did have a hard time in uni this past month and was under a lot of stress, so perhaps that factored into this. What do you think this might mean?

Ps. I quit Reddit some time ago but I had to make an account just to post this. That’s how much it disturbed me lol.",2023-01-29 05:27:47,1457,True

I go downstairs and find my cousin (who is now 1 year old) and who looks between 15 and 26 years old and I am surprised because he is taller than me. He looks at me and then bows his head, he looks gloomy.

From the stairs I hear my uncle talking but I don't see him. I go back to my room and my brother says he has something wrong (like illness) in parallel I hear a little voice but I don't understand what it means.

780,Dreams,Strange prophetic? Alternate reality type dream,"So I am pregnant and have strange dreams. Particularly because I have stopped smoking (though that's months ago now) and hormones. Yet when I was young and didn't smoke I also had absurdly vivid dreams. Perhaps that was a reason for smoking to block out. I'm gonna share my dream but will change/omit names.

I dreamt last night that I was in an emergency situation. Like an evacuation/refuge gathering in a town hall or hotel. It was quite big with lots of different areas. Everyone was there. Thousands of people. 

There was a woman there who had curly hair. She kept falling on her face. I was certain that she was the sister of my real life baby dad's stepdad. However I do not know the stepdad enough to have known if he had a sister or what she looks like or what her health situation is. I was also not introduced to her in the dream let alone real life, I just knew it was her.

Later I saw babydads stepdad and mum and told them that stepdad sis was unwell, there were coins everywhere. I had brought the sister to an area for someone else to help. Then I saw my babys dad. He was working in a shop area on the ground floor or next door. A bit away from all of this. I approached him and it felt as if we were only acquaintances... Like early days... He asked me if I wanted to go to a gathering at Dolly's* house. I was interested to go. Except irl my name is Dolly*. He said even though her house was far away in ...(and named a town which is actually closeby irl) he would love to go. 

irl I know one other lady with my name and she lives in a neighbouring country. Not a neighbouring town. It makes me wonder where we were?

Anyways... The strange thing was. When I told the dream to babys dad, he told me that his stepdads sister had been unwell. He asked me what did she look like and when I said she was fairly short with curly hair he said that SDs sis has curly hair and is short. Tears came from my eyes as he told me this. (Could just be pregnancy hormones)

781,Dreams,Could you intepret my dream about a snake?,"So, since a long time I've had a dream that I wanted to remember this badly. 


I remember dreaming a completely red snake that I took in my hand, it tangled around my arm and I was kinda playing with it and turning it around and then it was going crazy and turning itself around and I had a little fear it would bite me, but nothing happened. I put it down and just went on. 
Later I saw an old friend of mine with whom I don't have no more contact in Real Life and I saw him being bitten by the same red snake on the finger. 
We didn't know if it was poisonous or not but he had pain and we tried to go to the hospital. Another Friend that should have come, didn't come and also me suddenly, I took another path and left my friend alone even if I didn't want to. 
Thats the dream. 

The thing is that I kinda know with what this dream is collegated: Yesterday I should've met with an old friend of mine (not the same in the dream) and after waiting on her for almost 2 hours she just disappeared and dind't come, so I realised that she's a false friend.
So I think that this dream is representig what happened yesterday, while the snake might be my emotions. 
Still wanted to ask you guys, shat do you think about it?

784,Dreams,Weird creature.,"I had a weird dream or nightmare about a creature that was kinda like giant snake but it looked more like a giant hammerhead flatworm crossed with centipede and snake. It was kinda flat, spiky sides and segmented scaly body. And with tongue that extended out of it's mouth that also had grabby looking mouth. It's face looked like it had two mouths for some reason And it also had some extra tendrils for more grabbing. Spiky teeth that were seen at all times, big flat mouth. I think head was not that flat.

 
Part I remember best was about this creature going around some city centre and people noticing it and running. Old school looking bus stopping in the middle of the street. People running out of it. Basically chaos but people didn't notice it right away. I was at city square when it came to my view. It lifted half it's body up and swiftly grabbed two people. It was scary seeing how it bit a man in half while holding another one. 


Before all that I also remember at the start of dream that it was grown in a lab but they were unable to contain it because it grew too fast. Then it had to consume to grow gigantic.",2023-01-29 04:12:13,1129,True

788,Dreams,An Odd Place,"I don't typically remember most dreams; however, this particular dream stood out to me as nothing short of a pure oddity. From what I can remember, I'd gone just below the surface of the planet -- Primarily under the ground, in a field, via an old broken, wooden staircase. Once below the grassy field, I was met with the sight of a brown, stone ground with an immeasurable amount of stone pillars that varied in size and shape, a large gap that dropped down into sheer darkness, as well as an unfathomable amount of holes throughout the ground that too dropped into nothing but a pitch black Void -- This place also had a decent gust to it, wind eerily whistling throughout the landscape, shaking this little wooden/rope bridge that hung over the ravine/gap between where I stood [Near where I entered] to an area that looked the same as I'd described. [To give more outlook into what this place looked, it was large enough that I was unable to see if this place, well, stopped -- It seemed to go on forever; moreover, despite there being no lights, natural or man-made, the place was oddly bright.] The oddest thing about this, at least to me, were 2 things: There were 2 man made structures down there [The Bridge, and the Staircase that worked as an entrance] and it felt as though I wasn't alone, somehow within this dream, I had the overwhelming feeling that I wasn't alone whatsoever. Past that, I don't remember much else, just what this place endless, laminal, nonsensical place looked like, as well as how I'd felt whilst in this place.",2023-01-29 03:16:23,1546,True
789,Dreams,Recurring dream theme: unconventional toilets with no privacy,"For all my life, as long as I can remember, I've had this recurring dream theme centered around toilets that can't be used for very weird reasons - never because they're dirty or broken like I hear from other people, but because their layout is so weird that if I used them, I would be exposed in some way. The situation I'm in changes from dream to dream but the idea of a weird toilet is always there and me spending way too much time trying to figure it out that I wake up before I even got to do what appeared to be the main purpose of the dream when it first began.

It usually always starts with me wanting to do something else but telling someone ""I just need to use the bathroom first"". Once, it was before an exam at school and another time it was before I went into the pool at a country club (I had to change into a swimsuit first and when I change, I usually always ****). But when I get to the toilet, there is always a problem.

Most of the time, it's that the layout of the toilet or the door of the toilet has so many holes in it (almost like a jigsaw puzzle) that if I tried to ****, someone outside the stall would be able to see. The bathroom is always either really full or completely empty. One time, all three walls of the stall were just a bunch of rectangular holes and it freaked me out so much. 

This is the true recurring theme of the dreams: I'm always worried I'm going to be exposed or people will be able to see me **** because the **** toilets are NEVER normal. This usually results in me trying to find a way to use the bathroom so I can have some privacy but it takes soooo long that I wake up before I can do what I originally wanted to (I never sat for the exam and I never got to go swimming)

But sometimes, the script changes. For example, in the dream about going to sit an exam, I started off wandering around looking for the bathroom. I even went through a supermarket (that randomly popped up in the school) looking for the bathroom and had a whole other dream plot before I finally found the bathroom. When I got to it, it was huugeee. Like a whole two story spa. And there were toilets for ""little girls"" and ""women"". The ""little girls"" toilets were tiny so I had to use the women's ones. But for some reason I couldn't open any of the doors to the stalls even though all but one was vacant. So an old lady comes out of one of them and I ask her how to unlock the doors and she tells me to unlock a stall you had to first **** yourself with a ****. It was sooo strange. I had never done anything like that before (I'm 15) so obviously I failed to and I never got to use the bathroom. The dream ended with me trying to jam a **** into myself??

There's also another one where I went to use the bathroom during a family function and ended up having **** with three grown men under the staircase to the toilet - bizarre right?

There's so many other variations of this dream but it's always so frustrating that I can never use the bathroom in my dreams. Whenever there is a toilet I get a little anxious because of it. I've never been able to use one. There's always some weird catch to do with me being ****/exposed or having ****/doing something ****. I hope I can figure this out someday but for now, it perplexes me.",2023-01-29 03:08:32,3263,True

The dream started off with me on a beach. I was alone, until my family just randomly spawned. The beach seemed to be on an island, and behind me was a small city. 
I remember it being burning hot on the beach, so I decided to get into the water. However, when I got in, the water felt like a hot tub and made me even more uncomfortable. I was dreaming, but I felt the heat like it was real. Me and my family were like, “let’s get out of the water it’s way too hot for this.” 

Fast forward, we walked to the city and got hotel rooms. My hotel room was on the very top floor, and it was again, very very hot. I opened the door to my room, and my sister and I shared a room. When I opened the door, the room was all red. Literally nothing but red. The lights, the walls, the beds, the windows, everything, and it was SO HOT! It had been even hotter than before and I remember dropping all of my bags and trying to fall alseep but I couldn’t because of the unbearable heat. I ran out of the room down to my cousins room and when I opened his door the whole room was blue, just like my room….It was cool this time though. He seemed relaxed and I asked him if i could sleep in his room because my room was too hot. He said sure. My sister then came in and slept in there on the pull out couch.

798,Dreams,A group of us were selected by an AI to save the future,"A Teacher, a Doctor, a Librarian, a Lawyer, and a Construction Worker from around the world: these were the five individuals chosen by an artificial intelligence system in a dystopian future to time travel to different eras in the past for the sake of saving humanity. Their HQ, located in a dimensional space only accessible through time portals found in their homes, contained waypoints into the past that they would use to complete the missions given to them. These five people banded together and used their ""time keys"" –small, special devices– to access these waypoints. 

However, an evil organization with the goal of maintaining the dystopian future was determined to destroy the AI system and its 5 members. The dream begins with the first attack on HQ by an alien octopus-humanoid from the future. This highly renown bounty hunter had captured Construction Worker and used him to enter the AI’s HQ. The group was quickly alerted that HQ was invaded and everyone rushed into battle but the team quickly faced defeat as the bounty hunter shamelessly used Construction Worker as a shield to their attacks. Lawyer, who was dating Construction Worker, developed a plan to separate him from the bounty hunter’s grasp. She succeeded but lost her life in the process. The group did not let her sacrifice go to waste and quickly finished off the bounty hunter using their futuristic weapons.  Although the team was able to **** the humanoid, it reduced their number to 4. 

Several weeks after the first attack, HQ was attacked for a second time. However, this time, a hooded enemy tried to enter through the portal in the late Lawyer's home. The team successfully sealed the portal before it was breached but the reality of the situation quickly crept in-– they would continue to be attacked and targeted as long as they were members of this group.  Fear grew within Doctor's mind. Arguments broke out between him and everyone else. Eventually, he decided to quit for own his sake. On his walk home, he began to feel like he was being followed. He became fearful and paranoid. He walked into a crowded area thinking he'd lose the stalker. Suddenly, everyone started screaming. Doctor found himself staring at his back while his headless body fell to the ground.

The same hooded enemy that tried to breach HQ walked out of the crowd with the head of the doctor in hand. The killer dumped the head in a trash can and looked at their reward: two time keys. The killer dropped the keys on the ground and walked away as they removed the hood that was covering their face. 

The scream and fear caused by the public decapitation quickly alerted the remaining three members. Construction Work, whom was still recovering from losing the love of his life, quickly reached the scene only to find more despair as he laid eyes on the remains of the doctor. Teacher and Librarian soon followed. Construction Worker showed them the time keys and asked why there were two. These highly advanced devices contain the information of those that touch it. One of the time keys had one person logged while the other had two. The latter had the Doctor's ID logged as well as the killers. The former only had the killer's ID. That’s when they learned that the killer was their late friend, the Lawyer, who sacrificed herself during the 1st attack! But how could that be? She was dead ! A flashback to the killer unhooding herself revealed that she was a blue-skinned zombified version of the late Lawyer. She walked away from the body and into a time portal she created.

So after Teacher, Librarian, and Construction Worker realized that the killer was zombie-Lawyer and that she was somehow able to create time portals without the use of the AI system, Teacher came to the conclusion that if they captured her, they could use her time portal creation technology to bring their friends back to life by taking advantage of a time travel paradox known as time remnants. This is when you travel back in time and change an event without changing the conclusion of the event. For example, if the conclusion of the 1st attack is that Lawyer dies, they can travel back in time and replace her past living self with the body of the future dead self and bring the past living self into the future. That way the history won’t change (she’s still dead at that point in time) but she’ll be alive in the future. Then the dream ended.",2023-01-29 00:40:43,4401,True
800,Dreams,What is this called?,"Is there a name for this, when I was younger I would have weird night mares that were similar to sleep paralysis but I don’t think it was because I’ve had sleep paralysis before and it wasn’****. It would happen randomly during the night sometimes many times, I would wake up or be trying to sleep and my mind would focus on a random noise, either it being a neighbour dog barking, the fridge buzzing noise or even that loud ringing in your head when there is no sound.  My body would go in a paralysed state and I wouldn’t be able to breathe, then it felt like whatever noise that mind was focusing it would be 10x louder like it’s right next to me, I would eventually wake up, but when I tried to go back to sleep sometimes it would just happen again, so some mornings it would be like 5am and I would just stay until I had to leave to school because it would just happen again if I tried to sleep. Eventually I grew out of it, What is this?",2023-01-28 23:40:36,943,True
801,Dreams,I solved a murder mystery but the killer got away,"The dream started with a series of dramatic events. A high school kid was killed in his trailer, and a Muslim girl was assaulted on her way home. I was playing the part of a high school student who was secretly investigating these cases. The school gossip was that the principal was jealous that his wife, a high school teacher, was cheating on him with the student who was suspected to be the dead kid. So the principal confronted the student and killed him. However, evidence began to build up against the dead kid’s girlfriend. The police decided to arrest the girlfriend thinking she had found out her boyfriend cheated with a teacher and killed him in a confrontation. But their evidence was weak. Eventually I spoke with the Muslim girl about her assault. She was hesitant to speak to anyone because she feared the attacker would return. She was also friends with the victim and mentioned how she witnessed a confrontation between him and his girlfriend sometime around the guy’s time of death. I convinced the Muslim girl into testifying but she would only do it if I did her the favor of finding her favorite CD album. I found the album somewhere in school and the Muslim girl agreed to testify. Come the night of the trial, I had an epiphany after connecting all the information everyone gave me about the Muslim girl, the guy, and his girlfriend. I realized the Muslim girl was the killer. Before the dead kid and his girl were dating, he was seen a lot with the Muslim girl. Everyone suspected they were a couple and this upset her parents due to their religion. So they stopped hanging out and the guy began officially dating his now girlfriend. Meanwhile, he was actually secretly seeing the Muslim girl. During the time of his ****, the Muslim girl and guy were arguing because she was jealous of his real girlfriend. Then, he tried to force himself on her but she refused so they got physical, she grabbed something, hit him, and killed him. She panicked and faked an assault near her home to explain her injuries. She wanted the CD because it was actually a mixtape that the guy made for her. I went to confront her with the truth but woke up before I could. So maybe she got away with the ****, haha. Also, the rumor about the teacher cheating on the principal with a student was true...but that student was me.",2023-01-28 23:30:12,2328,True

803,Dreams,First and only team I got paralyzed,"I was having a funny dream about trying to find a public bathroom with no one inside so I could **** in private (lol) when a strange noise in my bedroom woke me up. I had two dogs sleeping on the floor so my immediate thought was that it was one of them snoring but then I heard a third voice. I was confused and closely listened to confirm that what I was hearing wasn't one of the dogs. So I counted: ""that's 1 dog, that's the other, and that's... A THIRD VOICE?"" The voice was whispering something around where the dogs were laying. Immediately, I saw an opportunity as this *was not the first time I've heard whispers in the dark*. I tried to listen and make out what the voice was saying. The whisper sounded deep and ominous. It was a little far from me but I could tell that it wasn't English and it was more of a chant. The whispers were slow and I could hear all the syllables. It was something like ""ika nao ta shi ash -- ika nao ta shi ash shiiii."" 

After I noted that the third voice was chanting something in an unknown language, I acted to protect the doggos from further nightmarish happenings. I moved to confront whatever was there (as I have done in the past) but suddenly my entire body went numb. I could feel the numb tingly sensation pulsating throughout me (ugh!). I could feel my ""soul"" attempting to move but my body wasn't following. Like pushing up against a wall with all your strength expecting it to budge. My vision then started to fluctuate. The clarity of the walls in my room had suddenly become emphasized (like if some drugs just kicked in). I was losing my grip on reality. I tried calling out to the dogs but my voice didn't reach them. So I pushed side to side until finally I was able to move and everything appeared normal again.

side note -- When we sleep, our parasympathetic system takes over. Blood pressure and heart rate decline, and pupils become smaller. When we are awake, we are more accessible to sympathetic responses (active/fight or flight mode). During fight or flight, heart rate increases, BP increases, and pupils dilate. This sleep paralysis happened around 6:10AM - 6:20AM. According to my sleep tracker, my heart rate went from 55 BPM to 91 BPM during that time. At around the same time, my vision became blurry and it was difficult to focus (symptoms of dilation). Sounds like my sympathetic nervous system kicked in hard once I realized I couldn't move, lol.",2023-01-28 23:11:35,2424,True
804,Dreams,I scared my sleep demon,"I was at a dream friend’s house sitting on their sofa and conversing when the entire atmosphere of the dream changed. It went from calm, cool, and collected to gray and melancholy. As my dream friends continued the conversation like nothing was happening, something behind them caught my attention. From one of the doorways came a tall, gray skinned woman in a white tulle ball gown. I remember she walked rather rigidly – almost robotic with her arms straight down her sides – and had beautiful long black hair. Then, I started hearing whispers. She was saying something but her voice was so low that I couldn’t quite make out what it was. I kept trying to focus on it but, before I knew it, I was awake, turned on my side, and facing my bedroom wall. Even so, I could still hear the whispers! And that wasn’t the only thing. My body felt extremely heavy as if it was being pushed down onto the bed. It was then that I felt a presence on the other side of my bed. It reminded me of the many times when I was a kid in bed and too scared to turn around and see what was lurking behind me. I became determined to finally answer the age long question of “is anything actually there?”. Like pulling off a band-aid, I quickly turned around to face the supposed “boogeyman”! On my bed was a shadow creature with its arms’ stretch out towards me and shaking its Slenderman-like fingers. It had a snake-shaped body and its head was elongated with no actual face though you could still see the indentations of eyes and a mouth. When I turned around, I had almost headbutted it. The creature – not expecting me to be awake and moving - froze with a silly flabbergasted look on its face. A second later, it threw its hands up in the air and screeched in fear. I just stared at it completely surprised at what I was seeing while the creature jumped off my bed and proceeded to fly through my bedroom walls.",2023-01-28 22:56:38,1894,True
805,Dreams,I chatted with a girl at God's Valley,"I was once inside a hotel at a bar called “****’s Valley” when I noticed a group of people having a fun conversation. There was a girl in the group that would change appearance every time she expressed an emotion. I was intrigued and decided to approach her to ask why her appearance changed so much. “I have my emoji feature on” she replied. I didn’t want to follow up with another question to not alert anyone and simply said thank you and walked away. I walked out of the bar and headed towards the entrance of the hotel. The concierge saw me walking by so I politely smiled and nodded in their direction. As I walked towards the door, the blinding light shining through made me realize how poorly lit the inside of the hotel actually was. I pushed to open the door and walked outside but a moment later I was awake in bed.",2023-01-28 22:43:07,826,True
806,Dreams,The first time I started questioning my reality,"I woke up in a townhouse in the downtown of some unknown city. Thinking it was a dream, I started exploring my surroundings and checking my physical features. Normal, as far as I could tell. I walked outside to see a busy street. Out in the distance was a unique looking train station with an enormous dome that towered over all the surrounding buildings. “What’s that place over there?” I asked a person passing by. “That’s the station” they said hesitantly. “To where?” I asked. “The other worlds...” they mumbled. Intrigued by their response, I decided to explore the station next. I arrived there and walked into the first train I saw. It was very crowded but the people around me slowly started to back away and stare. I didn’t really know what to make of it but a second later someone placed their hand on my shoulder and an immense pressure of gravity overcame me. It was so strong that it forced me onto my knees. “WHAT THE F\*\*\*!!!!!!!” I shouted in anger at the forced submission. I struggled as I used all my strength to stand back up while everyone just stared. I turned my head up to see the person that touched me. It was a police officer of some sort. “You’re a feisty one, huh?” he said, “Alright, let’s get you out of here”. He put his face close to mine. I remember it being blue and definitely not human but not unfamiliar. His face then unexpectedly changed into that of a demon's and quickly back to normal. I didn’t get scared but the surprise sent a chill throughout my body and before I knew it, I was safely back in bed.",2023-01-28 22:38:38,1547,True
807,Dreams,I stopped to watch two summoners face off,"I was exploring a metropolis and stopped to see a standoff between two summoners in a plaza. “What’s going on?” I asked a nearby person. “They were arguing about who was stronger and now they’re going to fight” they said. Just then, one of the summoners raised an open palm and then closed it into a fist. A red and gray door rose out of the ground behind him. It opened and a fog came out followed by a gorilla-like robot the size of a tank. The summon had enormous blades as hands that stabbed into the ground as it walked. It jumped forward with incredible speed and slashed the enemy summoner in half. The enemy fell to the floor but soon disappeared and reformed a couple of steps away from the robot. “Great. Now I’m one life down” he said. The second summoner took in a deep breath and clasped his hands together. He exhaled into the clasp and a mist started coming out the crevices between his fingers. The flow of mist continued onto the ground where it quickly formed into a line of ice. An ice door then rose from it and slowly creaked open. The air that came out was chilling. The ground around the area froze along with some of the bystanders watching. From the door walked out a beautiful woman with light blue skin, and long platinum hair. The gorilla robot moved to attack but it hadn’t noticed that its mechanical joints had frozen, too. The woman elegantly moved her hand from left to right, instantly freezing everything in its path. It was only a couple of moments later that I woke up.",2023-01-28 22:28:22,1506,True
808,Dreams,Munchkins and fairies called me Master,"I was invisible and watching a story unfold in what I remember being a world that was like a cross between The Wizard of Oz and Candy Land. I was in Munchkin town where the munchkins were in some drama involving the neighboring fairies (don’t remember the exact details). I remember becoming frustrated with the developments and ignorantly interfered by proclaiming that what they were all doing was **** and wrong. Suddenly, all the munchkins and fairies jumped back completely shocked to see me. It was then that I realized that they had no idea I was there. “Could I have been invisible to them?” I thought. They all carefully started to surround me and mumble words. One of them grabbed my hand and said “Master! You’re here!!”. All the munchkins and fairies became elated and began pulling me towards their city center. I was so confused. “Why are they calling me master?” I thought. “Why are they so happy to see me? They were literally about to start a war”. It was only a couple of moments later that I woke up.",2023-01-28 22:16:32,1019,True

814,Dreams,I was a Sea Witch's zompire slave,"Me and a couple of friends were traveling the world together when we decided to stay overnight at a local rundown church in some random town we were passing by. While getting ready to call it a night, one of my friends suggested we go exploring for this old attic entrance that a church caretaker told us about. We were able to find this small hidden door in one of the hallways which revealed a passage behind the walls. Following the passage lead to stairs that lead to the hidden attic. Pleased with our successful exploration, we headed back to our rooms to sleep.

When I woke up in the morning, all my friends were gone. I walked around the church looking for them but they were no where to be seen. I found one of the church caretakers praying with a group of people and asked him if he's seen my friends. He said he hadn't seen anyone around and then I told him about our nightly adventure to the hidden attic. The caretaker looked at me strangely and said no one should be able to get in there. We decided to go investigate the hidden passage. I showed him the secret door we found but upon further inspection I noticed it was completely bolted shut. Dumbfounded by this discovery, I turned to the caretaker only to find him gone as well. Confused by his sudden disappearance, I turned around to find the small secret door now open. When I looked through the door, something on the other side scratched my face and got my eye. I screamed in pain and tried running away when I bumped into another person who grabbed me and bit into my neck. The thing behind the hidden door came out too and joined in on the fun by biting into my arm. They twisted my neck and I died.

From there, I entered a ""3rd person view"" and witnessed what they did with my body. These things resembled grotesques zombie vampires that could hide their appearance at will by looking human. Their pale blue skin rotted from their body exposing the layers of muscles beneath. Their teeth bulged out like those of piranhas and their eyes were black with red centers. They walked openly during the day and behaved like everyone else. But at night, they revealed their true form and they hunted prey to devour. Those that couldn't would be struck with a hunger so bad that only eating their own rotting flesh would quench it. They took my body and put it in a coffin where I was transported to a local dock. My body sat in the coffin until night time when someone came to open it. Suddenly, I came back to life. I, too, was no longer human. My body had morphed into that of a grotesque zompire, too.

At the dock were several other zompires waiting in line for something to happen. The one who opened my coffin told me to stand up and prepare myself. I did as I was told and moments later, a ginormous, yet beautiful, ""Sea witch"" rose from the water. Her plump body was a light blue color with a beautiful round face and long blonde hair. Her lips were a bright red and her seemingly kind blue eyes were wide and shined with a sense of godliness. I was captivated by her beauty. ""My children,"" she said, ""have you brought me what I desire?"" One of my new brethren stepped forward and hunched over. He began to puke everything he had eaten. Fingers, toes, hair, eye balls, all sorts of body parts came out. The Sea Witch leaned over and began inspect the pile of partially digested human flesh. She opened her mouth and her purple tongue slithered out. It wrapped itself around the pile of flesh and brought it back to her mouth. She chewed and moaned pleased with the offering. She looked at the next person in line. The frightened zompire stepped forward and puked a much smaller pile of flesh. The Sea Witch looked down in disappointment. Suddenly, her jaw unhinged from her mouth exposing her large sharp piranha teeth. She quickly chomped down on the zompire, completely devouring it in one fell swoop. I could see the bulge of the once human being slowly making its way down her throat. I stood in terror.

The next in line was a zompire with a zompire baby. She leaned over with delight. ""My! What a cutie!"" she said. The zompire stretched out it's arms and offered the zompire baby to its ****. The Sea Witch took the zompire baby with two fingers, lifted it up into the air, and dropped it straight into her mouth. She did not have to chew for that one. The next was an extremely large zompire. He must have been close to 300 pounds. The zompire did not offer anything to the Sea Witch. She became furious. She chomped down on the **** zompire but even he was too big for her to swallow in one bite. She lifted him up in her mouth and chomped down multiple times. His guts and blood sprayed out painting the entire dock in his color. It was my turn next.

She looked at me already angry at the **** zompire's lack of offering. What do I give her? I had nothing! I froze and could do nothing. She leaned over and looked at me intensely. She waited for me to do something but when it became clear that I had nothing she lifted her head once more in disgust. ""Here it comes!"" I thought. Suddenly, a portal opened to her right. She turned to it with delight. ""Ah! Finally! You have arrived!"" she echoed. Out of the portal came three blue-skinned zompires but they were different from all the ones I've seen before. Their eyes were still black with red centers and their teeth sharp as ever but their flesh wasn't rotting. They did not look rundown but instead as if they were from an elite class. Furthermore, I knew these zompires. They were my missing friends.",2023-01-28 21:30:38,5541,True

1/21 dream

I was in my grandma's old house. It was dark. I was **** and playing hide and seek with a mystery man. There was just enough light to make out shapes of things. I was excited. I waited crouched down in the living room by her old corduroy feeling couch. It was a bit chilly and I had goosebumps everywhere. 

Mystery man found me and I ran down the hallway. I knew that by going down the hallway there was little chance of escape. It's a big house, but this hallway just leads to bedrooms. I bolted into the first room, the guest room. It has always been the guest room. With one big bed, one vintage dresser and a big window with lace curtains. He was right behind me. He grabbed me in a hug and we fell on the bed laughing. I looked at him. It was still very dark. I began to see the outline of a face. Hair, and maybe **** hair, but I turned away from him in his embrace.

We laid down with me the little spoon and got under the covers to get warm. I could smell my grandmother's house in those sheets. I could feel his warmth. It was comforting. I fit, laying my head on his arm as he brought both arms around me. In that moment, somehow I knew we had been intimate before, even though I had never met him. Feeling his **** body pressed against my backside, I wondered if we would be again. My heart still pounded like he was chasing me. I scooted my butt just an inch away, and I woke up. I laid there trying to decide if I scooted away so that he'd get the hint that I wasn't ready, or if I was giving him the room he needed to slide into me.",2023-01-28 21:06:31,1560,True
819,Dreams,We were ambushed and I was taken,"My friend and I walked into a gated area that resembled a graveyard with the hope that the local spirits would protect our bodies. We found a nice flat spot somewhere and laid down to sleep. The spirits began watching us walk around in astral form. We entered a portal right next to our bodies and emerged in a familiar safe house. We took off the pendants that protected us, placed it on a nearby table, and walked upstairs where we found a group of friends waiting. We were all talking and enjoying each others company when a sudden explosion destroyed part of the house. Humanoid enemies and dark creatures started making their way through the smoke. Our gathering turned into chaos. We didn't have our pendants so we couldn't protect ourselves. We tried to escape but they caught my friend and dragged her away. Some of the others tried fighting back however they could. I ran downstairs to get my pendant but soon realized it got blasted somewhere in the explosion. The dark creatures started coming after me too so I started screaming for helping. That's when another team appeared. It was a group of allies already in full gear. They started using their skills to destroy the dark creatures and the other humanoid enemies. They tried making it to me but the creatures had dragged me away far enough to take me through their portal. We emerged in a stone room and they threw me into a dark pit. My body suddenly felt like the skin was melting off while some liquid slowly replaced it. I screamed in pure agony and woke back up in the graveyard. I turned my head and saw my friend was still asleep. With tears running down my face, I whispered to her: ""I'm sorry! I'm sorry."" A group of unknown men appeared and lifted me off the floor. I screamed and resisted as they pulled me away from her. My vision began fluctuating and I could see the spirits still watching us. I tried asking them for help but they just stood there silently. No one should have known our location. Someone betrayed us. I was taken somewhere and the dream ended.",2023-01-28 20:57:08,2041,True
820,Dreams,I flew around with my dragon brother and found a city on the back of a large beast,"I'm in a war-torn planet fighting off an invading army. I was at a base when I ran into one of my brothers. In the past, I've dreamt of 3 older brothers who did not exist in real life. This was the 2nd youngest. We talked and he tells me we should get out of there. He proceeds to turn into a dragon and encourages me to hop on. I excitingly do so. He was a rather long river dragon. I wrapped my arms around his neck, locked my hands, and we took off. He was fast. He flew up higher and higher into the sky while making holes through the clouds. I was getting scared from the altitude and started wondering how high he planned on going. I felt the air pressure sliding me down his scaly body so I tightened my hold. We flew all the way to the planet's outer atmosphere. I could feel the cold pressure of space and see the light from the nearby sun reflecting off the curvature of the planet. It was beautiful beyond belief. He then decided to be a troll and started freefalling. The sudden shift to downward gravity and the quickly approaching ground had me crapping my pants as I held onto him for dear life. He eventually stopped being a **** and readjusted his body towards the horizon. While casually cruising through the sky, we noticed an entire city on the back of an enormous creature traversing a dessert.  I wasn't sure what kind of creature it was so I told my brother to get closer. He started flying around the slow beast's large legs while I curiously inspected it's dark, rough, and dried out skin. My brother got close to its eye which was now obviously larger than his dragon body. The eye looked at us and blinked slowly. I gazed with wonder and waved hello.

823,Dreams,Recurring dream about a house-- not sure what it means,"I used to have a recurring dream about a certain house fairly frequently, but I hadn't had it for probably at least 10 years, until now.  I've never seen the house in real life, but it's always the same in my dreams, except last night it was a little different.  

It's a very large 3-story house, and in the dreams, I've lived in it for at least a few years, but I almost never go upstairs.  The first floor is very **** and familiar, and I'm happy living there, but the focus of the dream is never on that floor.  It's always about the other two.  It's also never about the people I live with-- that doesn't seem important at all-- it's about the house itself.

Sometimes, the point (in the dream) seems to be simply that I'm wasting money paying to heat and cool a 3-story house that I only use 1 story of, and I should either move to a smaller house or start using the rest of it.  

More often, the point seems to be more about why I've been avoiding those floors.  The 3rd floor feels somewhat ominous; I'm afraid of it to different degrees from one dream to the next.  Sometimes, I think it's haunted and I refuse to even go up there, but other times I'm just a little afraid of it for no apparent reason, but I'll at least go up there to check it out.  In one dream, I decided to face my fear and finally arrange furniture in one room on that floor into a cozy living room, and hang out there and watch movies by myself when everyone else was gone, but then bad things happened (I don't remember what), and it made me not want to use that floor anymore.  The second floor doesn't seem ominous, but I still seem to not want to use it for some reason, but then I periodically think it's silly and/or wasteful to have all those rooms and not use them, so I start to think about using the second floor, but then I end up just going back to the first floor and forgetting about it.

Last night, after at least 10 years of not dreaming about it, I dreamt of the same house, with the same situation (not using the 2nd and 3rd floors), and my mom said I should block off the stairs and turn off the heat vents to reduce my heating bill (a practical suggestion, which is typical of my mom), but instead, I went exploring to remind myself what was up there because it had been a long time.  This time, I found all kinds of cool stuff that I didn't know was there, especially musical instruments (I'm a band director, and I play many instruments in real life), and board games (which I love to play irl).  It made me really want to start using the whole house, even the 3rd floor, which wasn't as scary this time (I was still a little wary of it, but open to the idea of starting to use it).  

I also realized that the 2nd floor had everything people would need if they wanted to live on that floor-- a kitchen, a bathroom, living room, and at least two bedrooms-- and the 3rd floor had at least 3 rooms that could all be bedrooms, or one could be a living room, den, game room, home office, or playroom for kids.  It occurred to me that I could let my brother live there (he's currently staying with me irl because of financial difficulty), and maybe my sister (who is also going through hard times irl), or start a bed-and-breakfast or something, so, if I'm not going to use it, at least other people could be using and enjoying the otherwise unused parts of the house.  

In the dream I had last night, I was excited about fixing it up (dusting cobwebs and furnishing/decorating the rooms on the 2nd and 3rd floors), unlike other instances of the dream, when I just kind of shrugged and went ""Oh, well-- I guess I just have 2 extra floors for no reason.""

Any thoughts on how to interpret any parts of the dream?",2023-01-28 18:58:32,3713,True

825,Dreams,home is filled with ghosts,"last night, i had a dream about ghosts. i’ve never dreamt about ghosts before, so would love to hear your thoughts. 

i was living in an apartment with my family that i don’t recognise. in fact, everything about the apartment block we lived in is unrecognisable, down to the car that was featured in my dream. 

so the dream started with my family and i gathering our luggage to put into the car and leave for some sort of road trip. 

i am then suddenly by myself, going back to the apartment to pick up some clothes that i’ve forgotten.  my family is waiting for me in the car. 

as i enter the apartment, i realise all the lights are still on, and i think, “ah good thing i came back, or this would have been such a waste of electricity”. i turn off a few on the way to my bedroom. as i turn them off, the atmosphere starts to become really creepy, and i start to get a little scared. it’s almost as if the color in my dream drains to black and white, and everything gets colder and darker. 

at this point, i start hurrying up, pick up my clothes, and then start to head out (downstairs), but then i remember i’m still missing some clothes, so reluctantly i turnaround and start back up the stairs. i’m getting more panicky with each second, and i’m trying to stay calm and not leg it from my home. i dash up the stairs and then bump into a woman. my hand brushes up against her shoulder. but immediately, she fades to the side. i’m freaking out internally but move on to grab more clothes, before running out of my apartment. 

i could tell that there were many more ghosts inside my apartment. they may not have hurt me immediately, but i was potentially in danger. 

in the elevators of my apartment building, which was a mix of construction site-looking panels and walls, there are many people. the hallways of the building are also filled with people, and there’s a stark contrast between the inside of my apartment and outside. it’s warm out here. the strangers aren’t necessarily kind though, and i feel suspicious about some of them. but at least they aren’t ghosts. 

realising i’ve forgotten yet another piece of clothing, i suddenly bump into a friend of mine, one i’ve not spoken to in a year or more, but friendly all the same, and ask him to accompany me back to my apartment. 

once again, i enter, and am overwhelmed by the quiet, negative atmosphere of my apartment. i run around grabbing clothing, a mix of stuff, and likely not what i came back for. it doesn’t matter, i just need to get out of here. 

finally, i make it out. i don’t think i have everything i went back for, but i’m scared, my family is waiting, and i’m sure i can just buy any clothing i need. 

as i try to close the door, i realise it’s not locking, and the double doors are no longer aligned. i’m afraid the ghosts might make it out. i ask my friend for help and he magically fixes it. 

he comes with me to my family car (on the way, i explain what i’ve just experienced, and i feel relieved to share) and gets in. i’m trying to explain to my family what’s happened, but they just seem apathetic and uninterested. i guess i’m not making much sense either. 

and that’s when i wake up.",2023-01-28 18:13:44,3180,True
826,Dreams,Weird dream about a book snoop dogg wrote.,"Ok so I had this super vivid dream a few weeks ago. 
Snoop dogg was on tv, I’ve been a huge fan since I was a kid so I paid attention. He was on one of the 24 hour news channels doing a promo for his new book called “ how to survive the hood as a **** man” 
Snoop was promoting this book that looked like a children’s style illustrated book and was saying that he had been a closeted bisexual his entire life. 
He even had a “hood” term for ****, he called it “skating” 
I don’t know what the **** I had eaten before bed to make me have such a strange dream but it was so vivid that I was convinced I had seen it for real and brought it up in conversation with my wife. She of course thought I was insane. 
It made me question reality so much that a few weeks later I was unsure if the Burger King promotion about the “ long cheeseburger “ was real. I had to Google it before I brought it up with anyone. https://i.imgur.com/czVPHsP.jpg",2023-01-28 17:53:12,936,True

(I had mo idea what we where doing or why I was there.) Everyone was chatting n stuff, meanwhile I’m just sitting on the floor observing everyone. Then Michael (black and white era.) suddenly starts crying out of the blue. I go up to him and I ask: “Are you okay?” He says: “Oh. Yes I’m fine. My mother just passed away..” “I’m so sorry!” He looks at me empathetically and says: “It’s okay sweetie.” Then I hug him and he hugs back. He pats my back with one hand while using his other rubbing his thumb back and forth. I think he was trying to comfort me? While my head rested on his left shoulder. **** I did not want to leave! I relaxed realising how safe I felt with him. We stayed like that for a while until we parted the hug. We where both hesitant, almost like neither of us wanted to part away from one another.

829,Dreams,Dreamception (NSFW),"I had a dream within a dream last night, and I was having trouble deciphering whether or not the dream within the dream was real because it felt very real.

So in the dream within the dream, there was this woman who was advertised on tiktok or something for providing some type of service, I don't exactly remember what it was but it was something professional. I ended up in a zoom meeting with her which was pretty professional yet low-key at the same time, but at the end of the meeting she started exposing her **** to me. At first I theist was a nip slip but then she was just full on showing them. She was very attractive and they were very nice and pierced, so I got pretty turned on and showed her mine and was like mine are pierced too. So things are getting hot and heavy and we decide to meet up in real life (""real life"") and it turns out she has a boyfriend and they bring me to this party that has all kinds of food and there's drinking smoking, and there were scattered pills that I'm assuming we're drugs but I didn't take any. The food was arranged very strangely too, like there were dessert items on top of pizza almost covering it, and the pizza was definitely from Pizza Hut. I vaguely remember becoming a third for this couple and having a good time with them.

At some point, in the ""original"" dream, I was with friends and was telling them about this experience and trying to determine if it actually happened. I was trying to describe who the woman was and looked through my phone to try and find our texts and looked her up on social media but I couldn't find her or our texts. All I remembered about her name was that her username was ""Uh-nuh"" or ""Uhnuh"", I didn't get her real name, but I couldn't find her or the texts and that's when I realized it was all a dream but it felt so real. Waking up from the original dream was trippy. And then one of my friends in actual real life (well on discord but in real life not in the dream) started telling me about weird Pizza Hut menu items which I got deja vu about when writing this because I completely forgot about that detail until just now so there's no way he could've known, and it was unprompted.",2023-01-28 17:28:31,2176,True
830,Dreams,I Had a Nightmare with a Dream Demon," 

Is this a lucid dream? I awoke at 4 am and tried to sleep again. I slept then awoke again but paralyzed. All of a sudden, something was touching me and physically it felt real. While tihs was happening, I wasn't it some random place, I was still in my room. Then I awoke and stopped being paralyzed.

I slept again and within 5 seconds, I was paralyzed again and to my left there was a little creature stretching its hand towards me. Arm was twice its body length. It was making a sound just like the girl from the ring continuously. I thought it was my brother who was sleeping next to me but it wasn't. While the creature was making this distinct noise, my brother made a loud snore and I knew the two weren't the same. I tried immediately waking up, I could feel myself moving my neck, trying to scream but on able to make soft grunts, and moving my leg. When I awoke, I looked immediately to the left and the little creature was completely gone and my brother was still asleep and made another deep sound snore.

Never had I experienced such a dream and I was wondering if this is something that really happens? Why did it feel so real and why was it in my room with no changes? I really thought it wasn't real until I heard my brother snore. It seemed like there were three of us in the room in that very instant until I completely awoke. Can transitioning into dreams from being awake in the real world be unnoticeable, especially if the dream you enter is set in your exact same room?

I haven't watched anything scary or anything relating to imps and dream demons for years so this wasn't fresh in my mind.",2023-01-28 16:44:06,1617,True

832,Dreams,A horrible nightmare inside a hallway.,"I wanted to share this weird vivid dream that I had today. I (male) found myself inside a hallway walking alongside 11 women following this 1 person, he was leading us down the halls (if i had to describe the hallways, it's like a decrepit subway halls that have been abandoned) towards somewhere deep inside it. 

Moments later he started to sped up his pace and me and the other follows along and then suddenly the walls of the hallway became distorted and disfigured like reality is bending. I remebered i was so scared and i hold hands with one of the women and started pulling her as to not lose her, and she did the same towards the other so on and so forth. The pathfinder then pulled my arm and said ""hurry"", we were like 1 chain of link following and running across the disfigured hallways until we turn left and reach this narrow pathway / hall with dead end that looks normal. 

Exhausted from all the running we rest for a while until I realize 1 woman was left behind. She soon showed up but seems to unable to enter where we are and just stood there, crying. Then, she looked left and........ **** man.... That face she made, I can't describe it well but the look of debelief and denials, whatever she saw was TRUE terror. She shake herself on the spot and vibrating as if trying to move but glued on the spot, moments later she got yanked to her left, her screams echoes so hard my ears are ringing, blood stared to splatter in my point of view (for context, the rest of us were in this narrow 1 way hallway on the dead end), me and the others hug each other, cover our ears, and shut our eyes. 

Then it stopped, I opened my eyes and cheked the others, still shocked from the horror not brave enough to find out. But then I looked at end of the path where we came from, stood there a figure malform, looked at me, it started to scream, then yelling and cursing and swearing at me for ""letting this happen"" and ""just watching"". I cried and then I woke up.

I remeber it so clearly and just found myself dumbfounded after, and I wanted your opinion on it. Thank you for your attention.",2023-01-28 16:02:13,2099,True
833,Dreams,I keep dreaming about attending a university I've never seen IRL,"I(26F) am a college dropout turned bodywork practitioner; I have no desire to go back to college, but for two nights in a row this week and several more before that, I've been dreaming of being a sorority sister within this fancy uni I've never seen before.

One of the main buildings is super tall and covered in mirrored windows. There was a botanical garden w/ a big granite slab waterfall fountain, separate from this, but still somewhere on campus. Whole place looked to be in a really busy college town, like it was fixed on the main street so you could walk to restaurants, bars, and theaters. Somewhere nearby, without ever being seen, there is a beach. 

1st night; I was dressed up by my sisters ""as a goddess"" and had to invite as many people as I could to our sorority's night time event(whatever that was). A mob was protesting on the steps of the main building of mirrored windows, (what they were protesting the day before Spring Break? I have no idea). They threw food and trash at anyone trying to get into or out of the building, including at a homeless man and his dog who were just walking by, so I shot pretty rocks at the protesters w/ a slingshot I didn't know I had.

2nd night; The protesters are gone, Badfish by Sublime was playing on a loudspeaker in the morning, and I found the garden. I had a friend breakup there with one of my sisters at the sorority. It reminded me a lot of Banshees of Inisherin where I went through too much to try to understand the breakup, despite her being abundantly clear that she simply did not like me anymore.  

Besides maybe 3 people I saw in passing, I don't know anyone I see in the dreams IRL, but it's all the same ""cast"" and they all come w/ a backstory that I never LEARN. I just ""wake up"" in the dream and have intrinsic knowledge about them(sisters, profes, friends)
I even have a whole Will-They-Won't-They situation going on with my favorite professor's nephew/T.A that's been going on since my freshman year. 

I wonder if this means anything? or if I'll find this place, like is it real? it's pretty fixed in what it looks like, but because the campus itself is so big and open I get lost in the city sometimes.",2023-01-28 15:49:36,2186,True
834,Dreams,What does it mean? (Trigger warning posted at top),"This will be a long post, also adding a trigger warning for blood, suicide, and infidelity. 

So, small background story. I’m working through my husbands physical and emotional infidelity that took place over a year ago with an ex that he reconnected with on Tinder. As well as digital/online infidelity from others on Tinder, and other websites. I fell pregnant shortly after discovery of the affair(s). I gave birth on Jan 13th to our fourth child. 5.5 years after we decided to be done having kids. I have been in great emotional pain the entire pregnancy and attempted to have an abortion early in the pregnancy, RvW was overturned 2 days before my scheduled procedure. I was very suicidal during this time. 

About myself, Ive always been a vivid dreamer and have made predictions and have had premonitions based on dreams. I worked with a psychic and medium for 4 years as an apprentice training with the tarot and palm readings/past life connections. 

My dreams are very apparent when they’re “important” they often contain smells, and physical touches/tastes. If a dream lacks a sensory ability, I usually write it off as nothing more than my mind creating funny/odd scenarios or situations. However yesterday I had a dream without any of my senses, but it seemed apparent. I’m trying to interpret the meaning.

I was in a “place” that lacked color. The rooms were white. I could not stand in this place. I was sort of crawling around like an insect, it was uneasy. I stumbled upon a dining room table that was quite nice. A dark wood, with a crest on each chair. My family was there but they were seen as toys or pieces that I could hold. I set the table up with the family, my husband at the head of the table. The protector. I began bleeding, I couldn’t tell where from, but it appeared to be from my ****. The blood pooled around this table. I started to cry and curled up with the “toys” as if I was grieving. I talked to a friend about it who suggested maybe it was a doll house. 

I can’t make sense of it. I had it night before last and am still thinking of it. The heaviness I felt in my heart in the dream washed over me like a shockwave. I’m still carrying some of it today. That is why I feel the dream may be significant.",2023-01-28 14:58:36,2243,True
835,Dreams,Dreamt of the same imaginary guy years after the first dream.,"Back in 2019 or 2020 I had a dream where my brother and I were walking home from the store. When I had gotten home there was a tall blonde boy that was my age in my house and was worried for me. When he saw me he immediately ran up to me and hugged me. We then went outside and sat by my pool and cuddled. This dream wouldn’t be weird except for how accurate it was. I am no stranger to vivid dream but what was confusing when I woke up was how nothing about my house or the neighboring places was distorted. When I dream of a recognizable place or somewhere I’ve been before it’s usually very distorted and I only know what it is because it’s my dream and my brain. I had written this dream down and said I wanted to dream of the boy again because the dream made me feel really good and really safe. I didn’t dream of him again till last night. Last night I had a dream that a tall blonde boy had given me a series of cards when all read together would reveal his confession to me. When I had finished reading them he had wrapped his arm around me and I leaned into him and told him I really liked his cards. He then pulled me closer and hugged me tighter and kissed the top of my head. This hug had that same feeling the first dream had where I felt safe and warm. My only theory is that I had a crush on my best friend when we’re freshman, I’m a senior now, and maybe it’s still lingering.

843,Dreams,On The Run,"New to Reddit, so you may see me several times in the next few days;)

Alright so this dream happened my first semester out of high school. It started with me picking up my high school best friend 'G' by pulling up in another friend's, 'C', late eighties sedan- his name was Chester. I yelled to G to get in the car, we had to go, no time to waste, etc. She got in, confused, and before she even had the door closed I was burning rubber. She questioned me, and I was telling her that I... maybe did something but, uhhh, she probably wouldn't like it. I told her we needed to stop for supplies at a grocery store, so we stopped and went in.

This is where my attitude changed. We ran into another friend, 'A', who also came with us, but as we are going around looking for rations since we are trying to get out of town, I apparently decided I didn't care if we got caught? At this point, I still don't actually know what I did that would have the cops on my tail other than stealing Chester. We got around the store, and A and G are putting practical things in the cart- first aid stuff, rope, bread, canned goods, duct tape, etc- while I'm putting in Oreos and bubbles. A pulls my items out of the cart, telling me we can't get those, we are already shoplifting, so we have to get as little as possible so we won't get caught. I keep putting Oreos and bubbles in the cart, because clearly they are so needed and who would notice- A and G certainly didn't. We made it out, I got my extra items.

We sneak back to the car. It's around this time that I realize- I'm on the run because I *murdered someone*. Hmmm, sounds a bit out of character for me but pop off I guess. G gets in the driver's seat, and we fled for the outskirts of town. Sidenote: This is a dusty, desert town, while I live in cornfields. We almost make it, before I see something out of the corner of my eye: Another friend. Two of them, actually.

My token **** friend 'T' of high school is sitting on the ground in a back alley sort of place, with our last friend 'S', laying in his lap. She is his girlfriend, apparently. To clarify- his being **** was not the only reason they never dated. She was there, though, because she had been stabbed (Not by me, I'm 95% sure) and was slowly bleeding out. We had stopped to see what they were doing, and when everyone realized how bad off S was, they looked at me, to see if I could help her, using my extensive medical knowledge. I agreed to, kneeled beside her, and made everyone back up.

I looked at her wounds; I could fix this. Then I looked back at T. Back at her. And I started to fix it, but I was going too slowly, and I knew it. I knew she would only slow us down, she would take up space in the car, and, most importantly, with her gone she would be out of the way with T. So I let her bleed out. I sat there for a moment, then got up and went back to the group, apologized, and made us go on our way. The last thing I remember is remembering that the person I murdered? ***C***, Chester's owner.",2023-01-28 13:10:51,3019,True
844,Dreams,Weird/Scary dreams when sleep-deprived half awake half asleep.,"Alright so yesterday was the second time this has happend. First time was a month back, it was late, 2 am, i had been listening to some scary movie stories on youtube for about an hour or too, when i decides enough is enough and try to sleep. When i turned off my phone i wasnt feeling too tired, but when i closed my eyes i felt like i was on the verge of falling asleep, my body became so immobilized, and when i was halfasleep i kept having this weird/uncanny feeling and i rolled over to the other side, again and again until finally i tried not to roll over and stay put, and then out of nowhere *BANG* Everything turned bright for a split second and it sounded like too metal pans getting smashed together, and that seriously freaked me out i bolted up and turned on my light. The weird thing is that i wasnt even really dreaming anything i just had this seriously uncomftorable/scary feeling all the time.



Fast forward about a month, i stayed up reading opm chapters untill 5 am on my phone, when i had this amazing idea that i should probably go to sleep. And i felt that same feeling, my body felt so relaxed, but this time i was dreaming. I was dreaming of a figure climbing on my roof right infront of my window, emergin from nowhere this dark figure and i thought i was awake, but i couldnt move, i tried to open my eyes with my fingers forcefully, now at this point i was half asleep half awake and totally disoriented, but when i finally woke up i just darted out of my room, an hour had passed but felt like a minute.

So I’m back at my old school in one of the container-esque portables but the only people I remember there in the dream are classmates of 2nd school. A girl I knew named Shaila is using one of the computers doing work or gaming I can’t recall. I feel like she said something to me but I can’t recall what she said. 

Now it is lunchtime(?) and I’m worried as I didn’t bring any lunch with me. This worrying of hunger seemed to be a theme here as in the dream, I remember worrying that I might not get to eat but remember my luck when it comes to acquiring food. My lucky stars align and magically appears an esoteric pizza vendor there, selling only strange pizzas such as Mayonnaise pizza contained in one of those let’s-go-to-the-beach-but-first-we-need-to-make-a-futile-journey-to-get-ice coolers. I buy one and he shows me my receipt and informs me of its cost. He warned me beforehand that the pizzas are expensive but I’m hungry so **** it. Twas $22 but the receipt informed me it was only $14. I shrug and give him his money. I don’t recall eating it though. Some other stuff happens at school but my brain has abstracted it so much that I can’t recall or explain it easily.

FADEOUT

Fast-forward and I’m now in an empty Subway restaurant food-chain but specifically the one that I work at.  I’m playing Ocean Man by Ween on a mandolin but I was playing it in G instead of its original key of E (*It has now come to my attention that I recall getting the mandolin at my school. I remember messing with it and being blown away by a sort of tone-switch that is on it. The switch has 4 options and the higher up I go with the switch, the brighter and tangier the tone gets. I don’t even know how to play the mandolin but utilizes the knowledge I have of music theory and how the mandolin is tuned, I **** my way through Ocean Man.).* Strange enough I played I V even though the verse of the song is I IV. I also attempt to sing Dean Ween’s tasty solo but I feel like I’m off key and croaking it. Some strange hybrid of Ocean Man and Take a Walk On The Wild Side occurs. My only audience, a shy Asian girl who applauds and compliments me after I am finished. She does the cliche thing that people do after the performer is finished and tells me how much that song means to her but she does the classic I’m-nervous-and-don’t-feel-exactly-comfortable-talking-to-strangers-but-what-you-just-did-was-so-cool-that-Introverted-Me-must-say-something.

I’m still at the Subway but it seems that the mandolin has disappeared and now I’m in some slapstick Bruce Lee karate fight with some guy. I kick his **** efficiently and with precision.

I’ve become a camera filming a movie that involves a young Brit spy who’s on some mission and involved is some dame that looks like Carol from the Walking Dead. The spy does spy stuff and successively seduces the aforementioned dame. Before the let’s-make-out or the **** part of ****, she gives the young spy 2 propositions and he agrees. Personal stuff like ‘don’t mess with my father’ or something of the sort. 

Extremely quick cut to the next and the spy and either the same girl or a different one are making love in the river of a marsh. You can tell that there is tender and loving emotion in the act. The way he wraps his arms around her back yells embrace. She is receptive to his love making as she throats out sweet loving but quiet moans into his ear. Further evidence of their sweet and calm love making is obvious when you realize that there is little to no movement in the river where they have decided to commit coitus in. Post-climax they let go of their romantic embrace and she falls into the water and floats for a bit. The water under her starts to bubble up and she is given the time-to-cook-then-eat-a-lobster treatment and goes under. At this point, the spy is watching this scene unfold when he realizes that a certain point in this film he’s in is that the water is messed up (via radiation or the sort I don’t know. I didn’t catch the exposition or background information of it. Must have been asleep.) and he cries out and goes to grab her but a friend of his already has taken hold of him as if to comfort  him and says with his body language: *let her go.*",2023-01-28 12:56:37,4252,True
846,Dreams,Any interpretation from this strange dream?,"So, last night i had a dream where out of context, I saw two trees, no branches, with an almost red/orange color. I have no idea why, but I was frightened and terrified on the dream, and I woke up just as frightened as in the dream, and I was left really confused about why. I was recently reading a lot of alchemy and symbology, but I still can't understand why it disturbed me so much, it was like I could feel the presence and energy of the trees, and for some reason it felt really uncomfortable and disturbing.",2023-01-28 12:54:30,515,True
847,Dreams,Weird Tom and Jerry/Knockoff Horror Game Dream,"NSFW due to gore-y imagery and general creepy stuff.

&amp;#x200B;

Okay, so, the dream started with a TV Screen (with a grainy filter and in black-and-white) with a cartoon playing with a Lion character who wore a ringmaster-type costume with I think an elephant? And Tom and Jerry were there as well chasing alongside the knockoff toons in a painted background with grass and a weirdly colored sky until they reached a barn. Then, the scene changed to Jerry inside a garage with very weird lighting. Like, it was super dark except for a large spotlight on him. And beside him, there was the corpse of Tom with organs spilling out and flies. 

There were also cameras filming Jerry and the corpse and Jerry had to eat a ghost pepper for a scene. Once he did, he started to give a wide smile (think the smile from Invasion of the Body Slammers) and his eyes started to become redder and bulged. In the dream, I think it meant that Jerry couldn't handle the pepper and was about to die. Jerry then looked at me and started walking toward me, and I kept backing up as he did so, and as he was about to reach my leg, probably to either harm me or something, I woke up. I think this dream was based on me watching some Tom and Jerry stuff and my brain mixing some Creepypasta stuff in there.

&amp;#x200B;

""Fun"" Fact: In the dream, it was implied that the Jerry and Tom that were being filmed were not the original Tom or Jerry, but from long line of other similar-looking mice and cats that would be replaced after every slapstick stunt (anvils, being shot, etc.) that killed them.",2023-01-28 12:48:34,1579,True

I asked them what they meant and pointed to my ear cuffs (which I wear irl, but not to bed) and said I was wearing triskele...why would I wear those if I wasn't part of a clan. They didn't feel like they were part of my dream, like they didn't belong there at all. They looked like...Vikings? Prob best way to describe them, but like they were straight out of skyrim. 

When I woke up, I knew I had heard that word before or something similar. I looked it up and sure enough...it was the 3 swirls. My ear cuffs are a different version of them and were advertised as triskelion.

I had fallen asleep in a chair somewhere on the second floor and when I went to get up and go to my room, floated to get there and face planted on the floor. I got up and finished floating to my bed. I was groggy so it didn't really register that I was floating at first. I got up and floated around the corner again. However, this time, my cat was backing up and hissing. Then it dawned on me...I was starting to become possessed. I landed myself and faced the apparition trying to take my body and told it wasn't allowed to have me. Then strange faces started to appear in cracks in the doors. I then realized...this was a dream. I told them I knew and they had no power here. Off to the side was a blue painting of Pete Davidson in his dream. I said to myself, if I am going to be lucid...I want to dream hop. I touched the painting and was pulled into his world. He was dreaming about the press or something. I wanted nothing to do with it and decided to explore the other parts of the dream. I was able to fly around and noticed that there was a fire that someone left to get out of control. I used magic to put it out and turned around to notice...a clover fairy.

I forgot how but the nests broke open and the ants started spreading wildly and creating more nests. Eventually my family started to build a bridge to the outside for the ants? For some reason? And the ants build a beautiful magical kingdom. (The forest is miniature and you must shrink to enter the kingdom) Now this is where the dream starts, but my memory becomes fuzzy. There was a girl who lived in the forest, I think she was a family friend I’ve never met but she decided to live in the forest in a little hut.

I was looking into this map but couldn’t find her.. so I visited some other people and did some side quest until suddenly World War One started to break out in the forest. I was Scottish and on a huge British boat fighting the Germans on land, the Germans sink the ship, and I sink into the cold Atlantic. I don’t know the fate of the magical forest but I really wish I could, or find the girl.

872,Dreams,"I keep having a recurring dream that I've killed someone (a man who I knew briefly 10 years ago) hid the body, and now I'm effectively on the run each time I dream about it.","Not sure if it's very related but context: I'm 32, female, live in Europe. Avid traveller. Never killed anyone. The man who I have killed in the dream is someone I knew for about 4 days while on a trip 11 years ago in Singapore, he sort of became an impromptu guide to the place for myself and my friend who was travelling with me at the time.

The dreams are always similar, I don't dream of the actual act of murdering this nice chap...but I know I've definitely killed him back in 2012, I know I buried his body near the Peranakan museum, I know I'm on the run effectively from the Singapore police, but as far as I know nobody is on to me yet. But my guilt within the dream and the feeling of dread is so real that I always wake up, shake my husband awake and ask him if this ever happened. I even occasionally text the friend who went with me to Singapore to doubly make sure it never happened. Then a few hours pass in the day and I'm pretty sure that I've properly returned to my reality, and I forget the dream until 6 days, maybe a month later, and I have the dream again. This started happening in 2015 and hasn't stopped.

About 2 years ago I got to the point where I thought I was going mad and my psychologist started to work on unpacking the dream with me but then some worse life stuff happened (sibling died unexpectedly) so my therapy became more grief counselling and the dream interpretation fell by the wayside. I'm now definitely nowhere near as emotionally affected by it, but it still recurs and always makes me think. It's happened so many times now that I've considered writing  a story about it.

874,Dreams,House Dream," 

I keep having dreams about this house that I went to when I was very young. My aunt lives there with my cousin and I haven't been there in 25 years. I haven't talked to either of them in over 5 years.

Last night I had a dream that I was renovating this house because for some reason I was the last person in the family capable of doing this. In the dream portions of the floor had been haphazardly replaced with duct tape. I jumped on the floor and sank an uncomfortable amount into the floor because of this. I was insisting that the repairs be made correctly and tore out the duct tape floor where it needed wood replacement. There were two square sections like dining room sized that needed replaced because of the improper repairs. The second floor was sealed off with caulk because of a malevolence that noone wanted to face. Yet behind the windows I could see two black cats that lived there. I wondered who fed them and thats when I woke up after sticking my head through the window to look.

This is the fourth dream about this house that I have had in the last two years. The other dreams revolved around something being in the walls and something being underneath the house. In each dream the second floor where my grandmother used to live was sealed off because there was some malevolent spirit there.

I brushed the previous dreams off as possibly my own hang ups or fears manifesting themselves. Now I don't know what to think. Is it possible that this house is calling out to me for some reason? I was wondering if someone else had a similar experience or had any ideas about this.

The house itself is over 100 years old and is severely dilapidated I looked it up on Google maps.",2023-01-28 08:55:21,1698,True

877,Dreams,I had something similar to a possession,"Setting: I use to do a work experience at my old school as a maintenance assistant, the layout of the school was, 1 main set of stairs a folded wall that has the assembly hall and lunch hall inter-linked, a general overview not the complete layout but just so you can understand the where you are.

I had just finished doing a task in one the rooms that has cctv and I looked if anything or anyone doing something dumb when I see a mass of dark black mist on one of the closed off stairs that right near the science Wing and decided to go and have a look as I open the door, the large mass somehow ran towards me at a demon like speed.

 next thing I know it I end up lying on the ground and as I get up, there is no one around the bell hasn't went and the building looks bigger than usual, I try to find the exit, I have no look when I can usually find the main exit with my eyes close so why can't I find it now.

I keeps searching no one around but every now and then I feel like I'm being watched.

As time goes on I see a figure on my back looking into window like we both know what we were looking at, I jump but it's still there, it's face us contorted with a huge big **** grin on it and a oddly shaped skull and large lidless eyes and sharp claws, I then went to a class room barricaded the door and slept and kept reliving the moment the dark mass came towards me.

 I woke up I don't know how many hours and seen a image of something a dark skull protruding from it somewhere of unknowable thing on that dreaded sheet of paper.

I kept searching and searching and would have random black outs now and then and end up completely somewhere else till eventually I had found a light and a golden hollow orange hu of iridescent threads of a evening before it falls into night and made a run for it seeing 2 of the strange dark masses what might as well being flying towards me and managed to reach the light before waking up.",2023-01-28 07:04:27,1931,True
878,Dreams,weirdest dream of my life,"the first thing i can remember is i was driving  an atv around with my girlfriends sister, who i supposedly got pregnant, and we were visiting some random people in my town. instead of stairs, they had like a 15 foot wooden ladder to the second floor, not the four legged ones, the ones you just push up against something

i had bunny boots on and kept going back and forth up this ladder bringing a little kid up, and then a bucket of something, and every time i went up or down the ladder would wobble like crazy and feel like i would fall. and i was wondering why am i almost falling every time, then the father of the house went on the side of the ladder and pulled out a sign that said ‘no bunny boots’ because somehow the sign got hidden behind hanging jackets. then i said “ahh that must be it” and took them off

we then sat down at a table to talk; me, my gf’s sister, my bro irl and his baby mama, and the dad. and for some reason the dad just kept saying all these mean things to the baby mama, then she started crying and i looked at everyone and they just dismissed it as normal so, we move

then the cops come in and give me like a paper or something almost like a warrant. it said because earlier in the day i beat up a little kid (which is weird because in my dream mind i was thinking no, i beat up my gf’s brother who was not a kid) anyway, they read out the paper to me and said because i beat up the kid, every morning i have to make the kid a bowl of cereal and call him cereal man. as they were reading this the kid came into the room with a suit, cape and mask on and said ‘you shall call me cereal man’ 

i couldn’t believe what was happening so i got up angry and said ‘am i in a dream??’ and turned to the right and saw a book on a bookshelf and that’s what made my dream self believe it isn’t a dream. so then i go outside to the patio and jumped into the water because i couldn’t believe the bs that was happening 

i can’t swim in real life and apparently also in my dreams and realized this too late so i’m just slowly going down flapping my arms and legs but nothings happening. i look up and can see cereal man standing on the patio with his hands on his hips in a classic superhero pose. i think to myself ‘cmon man save me don’t you want me to make you cereal every morning and call you cereal man?’ but he just stands there so i just close my eyes and thankfully that’s when i woke up. closest i ever been to lucid dreaming but hands down the weirdest dream i ever had!",2023-01-28 07:01:58,2504,True

None of these dreams were lucid. 

Last night I had a dream and this small scrawny Mid 40s dark hair lady came into my bathroom while I was showering, turned to me, and outstretched her hand like a zombie. I did the same, and as soon as we touched fingers she jolted and all life left her body and her eyes went white, her jaw hung open unnaturally wide, her face became sunken, her hair was matted and tangly and thin, and all this was accompanied by a ghastly reversed all encompassing scream. My only reaction to this was immediately lunging, mouth open, at the ghastly figure with intent to rip her face off with my teeth. I woke up making the same growling/gargling noise I made as I attacked her.

882,Dreams,Dreaming of being in a drug induced psychosis? Plz help,"To add context, I dont do any drugs or take any medication, which makes this dream strange.  I was at work, just like any other day waiting for customers to help out. 

Then suddenly I feel a shift in my consciousness, time starts moving in slow motion, &amp; I can feel myself slip into this drunken state. I begin to have trouble keeping balance on my feet, &amp; my vision starts to have this low frame-rate effect. 

My coworkers notice that I'm behaving slightly abnormally &amp; get suspicious as I struggle to maintain my senses. I try to tell explain to them I'm okay &amp; I never took anything but at that point I'm slurring my words. Later I can hear coworkers whispering amongst themselves contemplating calling police/ambulance on me. 

I put a heroic effort into trying to keep my senses intact but whatever has taken ahold of my brain is slowly turning me into a mentally handicapped person. Eventually they do call for help &amp; that's where my dream ends.

884,Dreams,Son having nightmares,"Hi guys, my son has had 3 nightmares within the last two weeks. Wakes up not remembering it but is super scared, shaking and breathing extremely heavily, heart beating super fast. He also sometimes is saying “I’m sorry, I’m sorry” for no reason. Also says “this is why I need it” - we have no clue what he is talking about. **** walk around the house putting on all of the lights around the house, and he tends to go to his middle brother instead of anyone else (perhaps feels he is safer with that brother?) just tonight he also kept quickly brushing his fingers on his head as if there was something on his head that he was trying to get off. At one point he even almost punched me in the face, but immediately said “I’m so sorry” - clearly not meaning to throw the punch. The closest thing I can compare these things (brushing the fingers on his head and the thrown punch) to would be tics, but I’m not educated enough to know if it is anything like that. At times when he tries to explain the dream it is as if he can’t form proper sentences, like he wants to say what it was but he can’t bring himself to.

886,Dreams,I'm just want to know what my dreams mean. Long post. Dream help.,"Edit: WIll no one give any advice 🥹😢😭? I don't mind if it's only on one of the dreams, or should I split them into multiple posts? I'm still confused and worried till this day 😰

Ok, so I'm just gonna start off by saying that I didn't want to post or write down any of my dreams because I believe strongly in manifestation, and I don't want them to some how be attracted by me speaking or writing them into existence. I'll never say these out loud or tell anyone close to me, ever. But lately I noticed a change in my dreams and I just want an idea of what they could mean.

This will probably be long and if I'm not formatting correctly or something since I'm new to reddit, then please tell me. Of course any help/insight into what my dreams mean would be awesome since I'm legit freaked out.

I have insomnia so the times when I sleep and dream deeply are far in between of each other but the last couple of dreams, starting back in December, I've had have woken me in cold sweats and I just want closure, like maybe it'll help me figure out from an outsiders perspective what the root issue is. This isn't the first time I've had dreams like this but I'm just over not being able to share them and find out if they have any meaning.

So the first dream I've had, that set this whole thing off, was of me with my dog. It was fairly calming, I was making tea, watching tv, getting comfortable on my couch with my dog when suddenly there was a knock at my door. I remember telling him to to calm down, that it was alright and getting up to go towards the door when I fell and landed in a chair in front of a desk. I was now in class. I was confused, because I was aware. I knew what just happened and I made the conscious decision to look over and there was a table of people just watching the class. A spotlight was on their table and I remember a woman sitting there behind a computer with red hair and glasses just looking at me. She had stopped typing and was now staring. In the background the teacher was speaking, going over a math problem and I had turned back to him to watch what he was doing as well as glance over the class to see that no one else was paying attention. Everybody had their head down, except this one girl who was blowing this huge bubble of gum. She was sitting right next to me and no one seemed to notice the people watching. I was legit starting to get anxiety. So I looked down and decided to take notes. The girl next to me popped her gum, and what she said scared me shitless. ""You see them don't you."" I dropped my pencil and just blanked. She got up, grabbed my collar, dragged me over to them and said, ""Do you not see them?! This isn't real, This whole thing is fake, that doesn't bother you?!"" She's practically getting hysterical and the woman with glasses simply states in the most dead panned tone, ""So?"" That woke me up and I threw myself up out of bed, from the violent shaking. I sat there because it was so vivid, all of my dreams are but I remember her voice just shouting at me to not accept that false reality. None of the people in my dream were people I knew. They were all strangers, no likeness to anyone.-end of dream 1

The next couple are long. If you have opinions on just one of my dreams you can ignore the others. I wasn't going to include these since they end with me dying, as usual, but the way they happen has differed from my usual dreams and these are recent so here they are.

I live in a 2 story house, if you were to walk through the front door, there would be a living room to your right, a closet on your left and stairs to my room straight ahead. My room has no windows except to the right of my bed. If you go through the living room you end up in the kitchen with my parents room on the left(across from the sliding doors) and the garage on the right. This is important because it takes place at my house and the dream changed the interior slightly. In the dream, there's windows all along my wall to the left of my bed going up to the ceiling, with the ceiling also being all windows. Also when I go through the living room I come into the kitchen but the only way to get to my parents room is suddenly outside the sliding glass doors and connected to another glass door on the deck to their room. The dream starts with me waking up in my bed, I'm just laying there and I turn to my left to look at my phone and see the time. It's 3:45 am. I'm tired so I put it back down and just stare at my ceiling except I take notice that there are windows. Confused, I follow the windows to my left and notice the windows that make up my wall. I pinpoint a small flashing light in the distance, it's blue and red with bright white lights. The lights are getting closer and with it a rumbling roar. The closer it gets the more the house is shaking and so is my heart. Practically ready to burst out of my chest. The adrenaline is pumping and I scramble to get out of the bed to stand and just figure out what the heck is getting closer. The roar is deafening at this point and I'm screaming thinking about how I'm witnessing a plane heading right for my house, my room. The biggest, **** plane and I'm about to just accept that it's going to hit me. It's approaching, approaching more, even closer, and just barely flies over the roof and towards the north or the right of my bed. The thing I remember most, is being so thankful that it missed me. And I'm just taking in every detail of this plane flying over my head, I could see the lights from earlier, landing gear out, the huge wings, it feels like forever as its passing overhead.

I'm ready to scream again and I just take off. I'm running down the stairs to the kitchen and take notice that the only way to my mom's room is outside. So I open the sliding door and just turn to my left and start banging on the glass door since it was locked. All this to wake her up and tell her about the plane. I wanted to know if she felt it too. I was hyperventilating and it started to thunder. I can see her sleeping and she won't wake up. I keep banging, yelling ""MOM!"", to open the door. She finally opens her eyes. She's groggy, sluggish even, and just yells ""what?!"" I point at the door and mouth ""open"" when she chimes back that it's already open. I'm visibly confused but slide the door open anyway when she snaps to attention, just struck by the horror of whatever she's seeing. She's sat rigidly upright just pointing, when lighting strikes and a growl breaks out behind me. I flinch, can feel the heat behind me, the drool dripping down behind me. Once again, I'm shaking and I don't even turn around. The glass door closes and I can see the bear's reflection in the glass door behind me. My mom starts screaming, jumping up and down, and I kind of just accept it. The bear dips down and I wake up feeling like I just had my head, neck and back crushed between 2 powerful jaws. I was dripping in a cold sweat from this one. This one unsettled me so much so that I got up and had to walk down to my moms room just to make sure it was normal. I was so unsettled from the feeling of being there and dying that I needed a cold shower, I got super paranoid of letting my dog out. I now look to make sure there are no bears around before I open that door.-end of dream 2

This next one was really short I just remembered being so horrified by the feeling that I woke up. It's a dream where I'm sitting on my couch eating a sandwich when something gets stuck in my gums. I put my food down and hesitantly touch my bottom row of teeth and try to **** it out. I'm struggling but it's within reach enough that I feel like I can get it out easy. So I continue trying when I feel a wiggle. The wiggle intensifies because I'm in disbelief, I'm like there's no way that's loose. So I keep playing with it, like I'm trying to deny that it's happening. The wiggle turns into my tooth coming lose and I just roll it around in my mouth before popping it out and onto my lap. I'm sitting there speechless, my anxiety is rising again and I just hold this tooth, my tooth, when I feel all my teeth suddenly become sore. I shut my mouth tight, but my tongue lightly taps each one to make sure they're still there. They all loosen, my heart drops and I feel a lump in my throat. I slap both of my hands over my mouth to try and keep them in. I can feel my saliva pooling and my teeth falling out 1 by 1 to swish around in the drool. My jaw is tightening, the teeth feel like rocks and my spit keeps leaking out the corner or my lips. I wake up once I choke on them. When I wake up though I'm watching myself on the couch choke on these teeth. I watch my hands drop, and the rest of my teeth come flowing out. I wake up again -end of dream 3

This next one starts out in america, on the west side, in california. I don't live there, so this dream was the weirdest one especially because of how it develops. This one probably confuses me the most. I become aware that I'm in a parking lot, it's vast, feels like it could belong to a super mall. There's cars but they're all far away except this jeep. For some reason, I have a job in a place I don't know, and I recognize that I'm on break, hanging out in this parking lot. The wind picks up, the clouds come in and the objects from the sky fly in. They're attacking everything. They look like flashes of light streaking across and someone shouts, ""Aliens!!"" Everyone tries to take cover and I run towards the jeep I saw earlier. I get in the back seat, duck down and try to hide and hope everything just blows over. When a silver intricate ball flies through the window into the back seat with me. For some reason it asks for help to hide too. It twists and turns, talks kind of like a robot, and asks to please not be given back. That 'they' were coming for it. I tuck it close and stay down. The 'aliens' come and try to break in through the door of the jeep, on the ceiling, and the windows. The car is shaking and I open the back door to jump out but realize it's raining. I looked down at the sphere, and remember deciding to not jump out because then it would get wet and for some reason I knew it couldn't be wet. So I just stay in the jeep until other 'aliens' came and shoot at the ones on the jeep. They were fighting over it, it had stopped raining so I made a run for it. I was running through this parking lot when I saw a group of people running towards this forest and hiding from the 'aliens'. The people were nice and let me tag along. We had been hiking up a hill through the trees when we stumbled on to some tracks. They were train tracks. It was a mass group. The longest of lines where people were making this journey to somewhere. No one knew where, just that it was safe and we were all together. It was steep, on the side of a mountain. The walk was so long, I recall days passing. I had slept outside, made a fire with the group that took me in, and the ball I decided to take along was quiet, asleep the whole time.

It had been almost a week when we stumbled upon a house, it was my house, in a place that it didn't belong and my family was there. The whole thing felt like a dream at that point, I was so tired, but the group I was with wanted to stop and we all decided to spend the night at my house to stock up. We were about leave when my mom handed me some books and told me to go pick what I wanted to take along since this would be the last time we could come back. I had a back pack, I could only fit so much and carry so much. For some reason though I was stuck. I couldn't decide what to take. I was struggling between the books I was given and my computer. This decision was so conflicting that my mom and the group started to plead with me to leave. They were yelling at me to just pick. They were screaming that the train had arrived and we needed to go. I could see people getting on this train and time was running out but I couldn't pick. Everyone was running towards this train and I had decided to shove the books into my backpack. Just as I got up and started towards the train, the horn sounded off and people were fighting to get on this train. Out of no where the 'aliens' return and start shooting at everybody, with it the rain rolls in, and a huge crashing roar rages as it rushes towards us. It's this huge tsunami, I'm watching as it sweeps everyone up behind me. I'm running, thinking about how I never pictured myself drowning, how a devasting event like this wasn't supposed to happen in my lifetime, how I would think to myself and be thankful that the movies of people being swept up didn't involve me. I remember realizing I wasn't going to make it, all because I couldn't choose. I finally felt the water crash into me, quickly rising until I got swallowed up, all warmth left me and I took my last breath. I woke up gasping for air, I clutched my throat and took huge breaths to calm down. The feeling of suffocation, was so strong I needed fresh air and went downstairs to let my dog out. -end of dream 4

Lastly, this also takes place in america, specifically ohio. Again, I don't live there, I just knew that's where I was, and also half of mexico, and texas. I don't remember much just that I was driving on the highway surrounded by corn? wheat? fields. Anyway, I'm driving with my family in the car when I see this bright streak of light stretching across the horizon of the night sky. It was so brightly lit that I thought it was day time. It becomes dark again, but now there are tons of tiny little dots falling towards us. I remember one fell right in front of me, barely missing, halting my driving, and realizing it was a rock. I turned to my family and they yell at me to drive, don't stop. I put the car in reverse, the tires squealing, when a deafening boom resounds. I'm thrusted out of my body, into the air and look around to figure out what happened. I see the car, the rock and notice a naval ship in the distance, another boom resounds and I see a crater form where the top of mexico is and all of texas. Another boom goes off from the ship I noticed behind me. Following the line of the boom, california is gone and with it a crater forms. Glancing back towards the car, the land morphs and it becomes board game. I see lines appearing, the ground turns to paper, and I'm thrown back into my body to continue driving. I head off road and just try to steer clear and figure out where the rocks will land. A letter &amp; a number are called and I realized this felt like battle ships but the ships were targeting the land. I'm hyperventilating at this point, scared that I'm gonna get squished when the ground begins caving in around me. The ground starts trembling beneath me and I fall in. I look up only to watch the sky get further away and soon be covered by a falling rock. I wake up, again in a cold sweat, with a pounding headache. -end of dream 5

888,Dreams,She Keeps showing up,"Here I am again. For the second time in exactly two weeks I had a dream about Danielle. I very seldom dream of people like this. I mean I still occasionally see my gorgeous Latina goddess who traipses through my dreams on no discernable schedule named Eliana Delmyna Rubio, who is real and will one day be my perfect lover in the waking world. But that's beside the point. I have had two dreams within one month about a woman I have not seen in seven years and counting. She was dressed very nice in this dream (out of character for her in real life) she had her hair in a sort of folded over ponytail on one shoulder and wore a brown jacket over a white shirt with a navy blue knee length loose, flowing skirt. WOW, she looked stunning and she was even more overtly flirtatious with me in this dream (which is unusual as she is married with children, but who knows she could be divorced by now, I mean it's been seven years since I last saw her. ) She couldn't stay away from me very long and just smiled and laughed as long as her eyes lay upon me. It was a very positive dream and I am happy to have had it but , why do I keep dreaming of her? We were getting fairly close by the time I graduated and I can only come to the conclusion that she misses me a lot more than I will ever know. I hope that I meet her again one day in the waking world. I venture out for necessities tomorrow, perhaps the dreams are preludes to an emotional reuniting . I sure hope so. She has returned to my mind, and my heart. 😭😭😭 I miss her and replaying her voice in my mind brings tears of conflicted feeling to my eyes. I cannot even hold it together writing this. Only she and Eliana Delmyna have ever been able to give me dreams that make me so emotional in the waking world. Is there something bigger in store for us that I haven't taken into consideration? I am beginning to wonder. She and I had a good relationship and I would even visit with her on her off time. There was two weeks though back in the end of 2014 to beginning of 2015 where I couldn't bring myself to be near her. Around that time I had a dream where I died due to Stomach Cancer and she was with me when I died. During those two weeks even the thought of her made me cry. My mom was also using a perfume from Bath and Body Works that Danielle used too. I recently found a higher end wax melts at Walmart that smells just like it , so maybe the smell is playing a part in triggering the memories that are being rehashed through my dreams. I miss her so much and I now really want to see her again but I don't know if she even lives in the town I live in anymore. I am keeping my fingers crossed that she does, for I would be delighted to reunite with her. Just wanted to share this update on my previous post about my dreams of beautiful Danielle.",2023-01-28 04:11:31,2806,True
889,Dreams,Coma music......,"

I had a nasty grand mal seizure a few years back and conked my head/face on a curb. Coma lasted 32ish days and the entire time, I remember one song playing in what I thought was real-time (I heard the people around scream for help, the ambulance sirens, the paramedics talking to me.

Even the hospital staff talking but not knowing what they were saying because the song was so loud with a mind shaking drum beat and guitar riffs that howled and were amazing to hear. 

When the song finished, my eyes opened and I had no clue why I was in a hospital or why I had IVs in my arms, a tube down my throat and another up my **** and why the **** did it smell like **** in here. 
(It was me)

After a few more days of tests and surprisingly great food (Celebration Hospital in Florida, nearest to Disney World), I was discharged with a boatload of aftercare instructions and a myriad of meds.

When i finally made it home, that song bothered me because I couldn't remember who it was by. I listened to everything I already loved, then stuff I was indifferent about and even genres that I really dislike.

Nothing. Not one handful of notes that even came close. 

It bothered me sooooo much, I started to hate the muted echo I still had of it in the back of my mind at all hours. I thought I was going to start pulling out my hair and chewing on rocks just to distract myself. 

Finally, after about 2 months or so, it started to dull and fade out. Coincidentally, I was able to start playing some of my instruments more and more again and I felt more like myself than I had in quite some time. 

Fast forward a few weeks after the noise was gone I'm just chilling out on the couch with my acoustic, playing a few old original songs and I start zoning out. Next thing I know, I'm playing the lead to that fn song, a lead riff that I've never played before but I knew it was the one that haunted me. 

I grabbed my les paul and hit record on my equipment and just kept going until I felt like I got the lead. Then I immediately knew the rhythm guitar chords and made it through that as well.

(For me, i always write rhythm first, then find and write the lead....this was assbackwards)

I called a buddy of mine that's an amazing drummer and ask if I can send him 2 tracks to see what he could do...

Half week later, he sends the individual tracks and also a mixed track with all 3 instruments going in time.

IT WAS THE SONGS BEAT. FML?!?!
HOOOOW?!?!?

I told him nothing about where I heard it or how I came up with the lead and rhythm guitar lines. 
Nothing. Just asked him to listen and put down a beat. 

It freaked me out so much, I asked him to delete my tracks that I sent and the mix down he made but to keep his beats. 

I deleted that mix so fn fast. 

Now, years later, I have no idea what it was and I'm incredibly grateful for that. 

Waaaaay to close to the Sun for me...

The song is gone but that weird awkward feeling creeps up a few times a year whenever I think I'm getting too close to it again In the real world or dreamland.

890,Dreams,dream that mom died,"i am severely worried, so much so that it is 2 am and i can’t go back to sleep
 because i read a little into precognition.

 last night i had a big argument with my mom about how my dad was narcissistic and didn’t want me to drive because it meant i wasn’t going to rely on him anymore and become independent. 

i also have very bad anxiety so any emotional thing spurs some intense dreams about my worries.

891,Dreams,Attempted Break In Dream,"I was in my house sitting in the living room. I got up to go to bed when I noticed I had left the porch light on in the front. I flipped the switch inside and it shut off. Almost immediately afterward someone started banging on my door, turning the door handle. I looked through the peephole and saw an adult man and a boy child, maybe 12 or 13 as the perpetrators. After there fists became exhausted the man started using a crow bar to bash there door in, but on my side there was no damage and they could not make headway.

After a few minutes of this they both ran toward a windowless white van parked across the street, where the man handed the child the crowbar. The child ran back to my door to begin striking again, but then the man drove off, leaving the child behind. The child stopped assaulting my home and stood there in disbelief that he had been abandoned. The dream ended here.

From what research I have done it has been suggested that break ins tend to represent an agressive trait or personality that is trying to break through. I can understand the adult representing the agressive behavior, but the presence of the child perplexed me. The only representation I can think of is that the child represents my baseline personality, often accompanied with angry or agressive flare ups. That I potentially use my aggression to get myself into situations where my baseline has no impact, and when I need that passion it abandons me. That's my pretentious take.

However, I was staying a little bit far away from the fight and was watching it thinking that I shouldn't meddle in it.

Suddenly, the yak spoke the human language saying that all the tricks learned from the octopus are futile. In the next scene, I tried to escape the yak by climbing onto the small house (2-sided house) and resting over the other side facing a frozen lake. However, the yak too climbed and was sitting on the front side.

(there was one stone wall about 20ft high and 2 gates the one that was locked behind me and the second gate which it was standing in. There was a open doorway which i ran through which led to a cliff at the end of it outside the castle like building. I was able to get out of its reach by moving along the ledge of the cliff hugging the castle wall. Alot of people saw this and it gave up and jumped down the cliff into the forest. It came back once more in this second dream but we set a trap this time and ended up blowing it up with gunpowder barrels.(this one took place over multiple dream days)

Then the horror started. In my reality, I received word that a nuclear attack was imminent and began to make my way to the shelter only to find we were being invaded also!

So, I was frightened and I suppose some part of my subconscious realized I was dreaming so I tried to wake myself up (which has happened to me before).

I looked around for a while but nothing was happening and I wasn’t in any danger. But I realized I was still dreaming and tried to wake myself up again.

907,Dreams,Dragonfly,"TW: Discussion of pregnancy loss

For context, last year I had two miscarriages. My second pregnancy was incredibly stressful. I bled for three months and was told it was something that can happen during a normal pregnancy and not to worry. Because of the bleeding I eventually talked a nurse into scheduling an Ultrasound to confirm the pregnancy was healthy. At 8 weeks and a couple days I saw my baby's heartbeat.

A few days after the ultrasound, I came into my bedroom after taking a shower and a dragonfly was sitting on my pillow. At the time I was living in an apartment on the 11th floor. There is a window that opens in the bedroom but it only opens out a crack. I panicked and had my husband help catch it and release it back outside but I was baffled as to how a dragonfly ended up flying through my tiny window 11 stories high. Fast forward five weeks, I went in for an ultrasound at 14 weeks and they couldn't find the heartbeat. By measuring the CRL they estimated the baby passed away a few days after I had my first ultrasound, around the time I was visited by the dragonfly.

Two nights ago I had a dream that I was being chased by something flying after me. A small insect was trying to land on the crown of my head and I was running through a house trying to get away from it. I couldn't see anything but I could hear the beating of the insect's wings. In my dream there was another woman watching me. She was a middle-aged woman with black wavy shoulder-length hair. She kept pointing at the insect and telling me to remember. She wanted me to know it was important and that I needed to remember. I woke up and wrote it all down wondering what it meant. Two days later it hit me, I had the dream the night before what was supposed to be my due date and the sound of the wings beating sounded exactly like the dragonfly.

Any idea what this dream could mean?",2023-01-28 01:02:09,1878,True
909,Dreams,Doppelganger Family,"I dreamed about a family being stalked by their own doppelgangers. The doppelganger's sole purpose was to replace each and every original family member: a mother, father, daughter, and son for reasons that were unclear in the dream, but the doppelgangers were vehement in their mission to do so.
While at a grocery store, the family were in the check out line. The daughter and son were roughhousing, the mother was making a transaction with the cashier while the father loaded bags of groceries onto a shopping cart - very much a nuclear family type. The father lifted a seemingly heavy bag and leaned in to tell the mother something, but when she looked at him he froze, dropping everything to the ground without taking notice and began to shake violently while breaking into a nervous sweat. ""You.."" he said ""Get away from me..""
The mother looked concerned, but the father stood his ground. ""Somebody get her away from me, I'm gonna be sick!"" He leaned forward, hands on his knees, breathing heavily. The children had taken notice and huddled up behind the mother in fear as she pleaded for him to calm down to which he responded hysterically ""You're not my wife! Somebody get her away from me, please! I'm gonna be sick!""
The look on the mother's face went from concerned to annoyed and disgusted - pure evil. 
He was right, it wasn't his wife.

913,Dreams,I felt death in a very vivid dream,"
Let me preface this by saying that I am not a religious person in the slightest. I also know that dreams of dying are very common, and I have had them before. But somehow this dream stands out, it felt far more vivid than any dream I think I've ever had. 







As is with most dreams, I only remember a certain part of it. A ""demon"", so to say, was threatening my friend, and I defended my friend. This demon said if I did not back down I would be killed. I, of course, did not back down. I started to feel very weak, and slowly fell to the ground. My muscles started to give out and I became very at peace with reality. I was not scared, I was simply curious. I vividly remember asking myself if there was a ****, and if I would go to heaven or ****. Again, I am NOT religious. I was really just curious about what happened after death. I realized that this was the end and that I could do nothing to stop it.






But, despite all this, the dream felt way, wayy too vivid. I've had dreams of death before, and I usually realize it's a dream the second I actually ""die"". But in this dream, I thought I was really dying. I laid on the floor dying for quite a few minutes. All of it felt so real. But it was peaceful. And powerful. I don't know why, but I felt as if I had all the willpower of the universe, as I literally laid dead. It was so surreal. 







I know that dreams of death symbolize change, but this one feels like it is so much more. I want to truly know what this meant.",2023-01-27 23:24:56,1491,True

921,Dreams,Weirdest dream within a dream experience I’ve ever had,"This happened last night and I haven’t been able to stop thinking about it all day. So I had a dream that I was late for work. It was a very surreal dream where I was living in my childhood home with a roommate who was an old coworker of mine that I was never close with.

I woke up in my actual bed thinking about how strange the dream was. I looked at the time and realized I was late for work. I was panicking and ran downstairs and my fiancé came with me. I don’t know why, but I started to get the hunch that I was in a dream. I looked at the clock on my oven and blinked, and sure enough the time was wildly different. I was like “oh ****, I’m dreaming” and my fiancé was trying to convince me it was real life. I was trying my damndest to wake up, but I wasn’t.

I then woke up, and again was late fo work and thought about what a strange coincidence it was that I dreamt about that twice when it was the reality. I looked at the time on my phone and blinked. The time wildly changed again.


I believe I went through this one more tome before I woke up for real. It was an hour before I needed to be awake but I didn’t want to go back to sleep and have the dreams come true lol. I’ve had dreams without dreams before but it’s never been like this",2023-01-27 21:01:12,1254,True
922,Dreams,What’s your interpretation of the dream?,"The dream begins with a group of us hanging out in the woods. There’s a tribal woman in the group that recognizes a doll (looked more like a sachet than a doll) that a young girl had lying out on a rock. She says she wants to put it where it’s meant to be. (Somewhere dark like a forest, even though we were already in the woods). Doesn’t seem we go anywhere but she then lays it on a different rock maybe 5ft away, and says “This is how it’s meant to be”…

She then wants to take me to see a treasure somewhere face away. We then began leaping/jumping across large masses of land and waters. The destination was a pond of crystal clear water. We swam around briefly and I decided to venture underneath. Once I was a few feet under, I noticed there were sea turtles, and lots of fish. Then I noticed an eel approaching, I felt uncomfortable and panic slowly crept in. It didn’t seem to have intentions of harming me, just swimming towards me as if acknowledging my presence before veering off to my right. (In my mind I pictured myself whooshing it away had it gotten any closer).

Once I came back up to the surface I noticed a few of my friends sitting around the edges. The pond became more “pool like”. The guys were doing cannon balls and flips into the water. I felt as though they weren’t truly appreciating and seeing the beauty in the water so I decided to “show” them how beautiful it was. I get into the water attempting to submerge myself while laying flat on the surface only to realize I was ****. I somehow used the surface of the water to blanket parts of my **** body. One of the guys made a comment “life of a stripper” even though I’ve never done anything of the sort. (I wasn’t ashamed or embarrassed for being exposed in front of my friends, irl I would be) The dream ends with me stuck on the surface of the water despite it moving beneath me",2023-01-27 20:35:37,1864,True
923,Dreams,Person telling me to meet her irl in a dream,"So a while ago (almost a year) i had a weird dream that i kept thinking about recently. It basically goes like this:

So it starts off just with a girl looking at me on the beach. Next scene we small talk during night. Next scene I’m playing a weird version of football in a stadium that’s not related to this story… Anyway, the girl is on the field staring at the stars. I go up to her and ask her if she knows she’s in a dream, and she surprisingly responds with just “yes”. I tell her about how annoying this dream is because it “spawned” me in the middle of the game, so i don’t really understand what’s going on. She laughs, and agrees with me, telling me that these dreams are annoying for her as well. As we are leaving the stadium, she suddenly grabs my arm and tells me that her name is Hannah and to meet her in real life at a certain address. I get thrown on the floor by some people and get kicked in the stomach. I wake up in a dream, where i write down the address, and then i wake up for real.

After that i quickly did what my last dream suggested, but i also decided to write down the whole dream, so I don’t forget.
The address is in italy (where i live), and it does exist. But while i never heard of it in my life, it could sound generic enough for my mind to make up.

I was very hyped about it at the time, and i also wanted to go there just to check, but i got distracted and quickly forgot. I never told anyone this story.

It started as in the same position i was sleeping in. Except that i couldn't move my body (i can't tell if i was awake at this part, but even if i wasn't it felt real.)

&amp;#x200B;

Now, this will not be a complete retelling as this was written hours later.

For context: in my childhood bedroom, my closet was a small walk-in with shelves on one side that connect to the hallway as a linen closet. It's confusing I know, but my house was built during the times of segregated water fountains.

&amp;#x200B;

At first, I ran into the closet of my childhood bedroom, followed by the Mane 6 from My Little Pony Friendship is Magic. some kind of entity with the voice of a YouTuber I frequently watch was trying to hunt the ponies for some reason. We were all hiding in my closet for a few minutes, until the aforementioned door to the hallway was opened and we all scattered, I ran outside and instead of my usual neighborhood, it was that of my best friends neighborhood.

&amp;#x200B;

After I walked out I was approached by Lil Nas X. I asked him about the ponies, but he dodged the question and we went for a walk. We walked for a while until we came to this place of wicker bumps and hills. We went to the tallest hill and we started to sing and everyone was loving it, until he inevitably disappeared, I spent the rest of the dream walking around trying to find a way back ""home"" and then I realized that this weird bump land was entirely populated by drug users.

Somehow (I don’t even know how) I was sitting in a park bench surrounded by moving water. It gave the sense of sea but I am not sure it was the sea because the waves were not big, they were slightly intimidating though. The water was grey-green—brown, and as each wave moved, I could see huge manta rays moving through it, some very close to the surface while others a bit deeper, but I could see their shape.

I have never dreamed about this anima before and I was wondering if Simone could point me to resources to find out more about their meaning.",2023-01-27 16:56:07,645,True

A gunman shot someone near him three times in the chest, then faced me just outside the door and shot me.

Another one I was in an apartment complex hiding with two young kids, a gunman came in shot the kids and then shot me three times in the chest aswell.

There's several more stories like these but these 2 stuck out to me the most.

Everytime I get shot I can always feel the ""pain"" its like a balloon popping in my chest, then I wake up and feel like I can't breathe.

I also remember trying to pull the worms off, as they'd attach to me like leaches, but weren't leaches, &amp; they'd just then bite my hands &amp; attach themselves onto my hands. I vividly remember how it felt, though... typically you're not supposed to ""feel"" anything in your dreams, but I definitely felt everything happening. It was incredibly painful.

I don't know, but the part that was odd was it was practically abandoned yet people who I've never seen before were doing construction, making a new attraction for people who weren't even there, one said attraction was a colorful and fun little area with carts that took you around but a figure appeared saying ""you better get out, He's hungry"" before I heard something large coming towards me. Then another part of that same dream there was a little boy who just had this look in his eyes, he looked like he meant harm and before he did anything I woke up. I don't know what it was about that dream but it felt like I was actually there, I felt the pain of hitting my shoulder on a wall, the fear I felt in my chest, and just everything that you wouldn't feel in a normal dream. You can't feel pain in dreams can you?

the most of the dream is quite fuzzy, but i clearly remember certain actions and the way it made me feel. the “main characters” were my best friend (who passed away almost a year ago) and this guy i had a situationship with, that i have developed feelings for. 

in the dream i was given the option to ****/let the guy i care for die in order to bring my best friend back, which i did with close to no hesitation. the dream continued with me having a conversation with my best friend like nothing had happened.

944,Dreams,Another night of existential dreaming,"Basically it was like an insight into alternative timelines where other me’s would dive into different realms (what we think of as ‘dreams’) and go through like moral choices to gauge the average response. Except I was the rogue one bc the chip implanted in me was broken so I could recognize I was dreaming and control the dream to a certain extent. 

Basically I could do almost anything. My ultimate power was the “Thank You”. I would cup my hands together and hold them at the sky and say “Thank you for [insert experience here]” and then cast it at the ground and it would destroy everything or irreparably change it. If I specified a “reward” for my “thanks” it would manifest in the most chaotic way possible. 

I was then **** out of the dream after I did a dream destroying “Thank You” and was questioned about it. I’d been doing them for a while but they only just caught me bc there were billions of different “me’s” all cycling though dreams at the same time. 

The Controller wasn’t a Me but someone I didn’t know. She said I was ruining the algorithm and that they were going to terminate me for going off course and that they were doing this to make the world a better place. I scoffed and said “it’s too late for one person or even a million people to make a difference in the world. It’s already doomed through years and years of misuse of resources, warmongering, and purposefully constructed ‘otherism’ (the notion that We are better than Them because They are Different). 

I told her that earth is doomed by the hubris of man and if she only just started realizing that then she was objectively a naive idiot. I said “what are you going to do next then? Wait until the earth turns barren and empty then move on to the next planet to perform your nonsensical simulations for the vague and unachievable goal of making a better place? That’s ludicrous. If you actually wanted to create a better world just step up and use whatever powers you have over dreaming to influence people’s realities instead of trying to gauge how much capacity they have for ‘good’” then I woke up 👍",2023-01-27 15:29:41,2094,True
945,Dreams,Self referencing dream,"Just had a dream that I woke up late on a day that everyone had to see an Incredibly Important Movie. There were some random introductory details about electronic wall vines on my window and then looking out said window to see an adjacent building being evacuated due to a fire alarm (which ended up coming true when I actually woke up, interestingly enough, except in my own building instead of an adjacent one, which I ended up sleeping through and found out about later in the day due to the alarm only going off on the ground floor for some reason).

The interesting part happened when I finally got around to seeing the movie though. I made my way through some hallways and stairwells, pushed ahead of a rowdy crowd who was also rushing to see the movie, and made it to a snowy outdoor area with a long line to the box office kiosk. As I was waiting in line, with the confidence that I had gotten there in time after all, I spotted an LED sign on top of the kiosk. I don’t remember the exact wording of the sign, but it said something along the lines of:

**[?]% of people wake up after seeing this movie. 
[?]% of people wake up while seeing this movie.**

I do remember what I thought when I saw this sign, which was “hmm this movie must appear in people’s dreams sometimes, maybe that’s why it’s such a revolutionary film.” I was not aware that I, myself was dreaming. I made it through the line to the box office and successfully received my ticket. As I was walking away, the guy in the booth reminded me that I hadn’t paid yet, so I paid with a debit card. He made some comment about having credit on my account that I could have used, but I didn’t understand it and kept walking in towards the theater. Before I made it inside, I woke up. 

Has this happened to anyone else where you’ve received signs that you’re dreaming, whether you already knew that you were dreaming or not?",2023-01-27 15:28:27,1891,True
946,Dreams,I had a very disturbing dream about my deceased grandfather. What could it mean?,"TW: &gt;!mention of suicide!&lt;

As the title suggests, my dream was about grandfather who died in July of 2022. I think I might’ve been the same age I am now (26). For context, my grandfather was very sick. He had been experiencing a lot of health problems and was in the hospital two times. Once to be put in life support which he eventually was able to come of it with no problems. The second time was a week later, where he died from having too much fluid in his lungs. All I was thinking during that time was how much time we could’ve had, but also, I was glad he wasn’t suffering any longer. 

In the dream, I was at my grandparents house. They had a pool in the backyard that, in the dream, was deeper than it was in real life. We were going about our day and I was just chilling in their house. Then my grandfather walked up to say goodbye to me and that he loves me. Then he walked outside to the pool. &gt;!He tied a very heavy rock to his legs and jumped in.!&lt; and then he was just gone. I did nothing to help him.

I know it was just a dream or rather, a nightmare, but I just can’t help but feel guilty about the events that transpired. I guess I’m just looking for some interpretation and insight. Thank you in advance for reading.",2023-01-27 15:21:28,1249,True

My question is, do most people who work with magick/have a spiritual practice, are your dreams like mine or theirs where they are very complicated, it doesn’t involve your mundane life/world very much, or you’re not even yourself?(like you’re basically sharing a consciousness with the main character of the dream)",2023-01-27 13:51:29,722,True

The weather was nice, Sun was shinning, sky wasn’t blue. It reminds me of a sky that’s been rainy and overcast but not super grey. There were manicured bushes and green trees. I notice something weird (this part is a little fuzzy) a girls legs in blue jeans and brown boots up to the calf was hanging out the garbage dump. Think of the trash that you see in the back/side of companies, grocery stores and restaurants. Her legs where kind of sticking upward out the trash.

So in my dream, I was in an old house (it was my house that I shared with my mom and my sister) and we decided to pack stuff to throw away. We went to the attic with my mom and they were toys (old dolls (porcelain, mid 1900’s) and teddy bears) and I was looking to the left and I saw a teddy bear and his head is turning towards me, I was scared and then all the toys jumped on me and my mother and I wake up terrified.

Can someone explain me what does it means ?

That’s not the only thing I wanna share. I have the same teddy bear that I had in my dream in real life. I saw it months ago in a store and I really liked him so I decided to buy it online from the same company. But even if I find him really cute, I always had bad vibes since I had him. Firstly, when I was on my computer and he was on my bed I always felt like something was watching me (I never had that feeling before even with my other dolls (because I have also dolls)) and I couldn’t sleep with him in my bed so I was so scared that days later receiving him, I put him in my attic. 

Do you think it’s a sign that -maybe- he is possessed and I should throw it away ? It’s the first time I had that dream with him in it but I’m also starting to get paranoid and what if the spirit in it got attached to the house and myself now and I can’t do something ? 

Please really help me, with your opinion and what should I do, I’m really serious and looking for serious feedback. Thank you!",2023-01-27 11:03:11,1594,True

The dreams usually occur when I go back to sleep for an hour or two after a good night’s sleep (6-7 hours of solid sleep). They can be lucid, and are the first lucid dreams I’ve had. 

Last night was intense, I had to stay in bed with my eyes closed trying to relax. He was violent and controlling and much worse than he ever was in real life. I guess the obvious answer is to not go back to sleep? Frequently after this I wake up feeling exhausted, though this passes after a bit.

973,Dreams,Need help interpreting a dream,"Hello, just as the tilte says i need help interpreting a dream i had last night.

The dream started with me sitting in my living room looking at my phone when i suddenly feel someone coming up behind me. I didnt look at it/them and covered my eyes but i felt scared. They put their hands on my shoulders and said ""i just wanna see what youre doing"". 

Suddenly im sitting in my room looking at my phone again and the same thing happens again and im scared and cower my eyes. But this time they say ""i just wanna know what goes on in your head"" then when i look up i see a pair of kids around the age of 12. Its a boy on the left and a girl on the right. Neither of them has a face.

I dont remember the boy as clearly as i remember the girl but he had short, spiky, brown hair with a blue shirt and beige shorts. The girl had straight, blond, shoulder length hair and a pink long sleeved shirt with white poka dots and light blue skinny jeans. Then they smile, i couldnt really see it but i felt it. I wasnt creeped out or scared by them though. Then i woke up.

I havent been able to stop thinking about this dream since i woke up and if anyone has any idea of what it could mean i would really appreciate it!

(Extra info the kids dont look like anyone i know in real life, theyre complete strangers to me)",2023-01-27 08:08:24,1308,True

975,Dreams,Had a dream of my ex…But I’m in a healthy relationship and don’t have dreams of my current partner. WTH!?,"So… I keep dreaming and fantasizing about my relationship with my ex. We ended up breaking up on mutual terms because I had to move and TBH she didn’t want to be in a relationship, at the time. I was probably a bit immature when we dated and now I found myself in a healthy relationship with someone who is beautiful, inside and out. But I keep on having reoccurring dreams and fantasies about me with my ex… Haven’t spoken to her in about 5 to 6 years but I wonder if this is a sign I should reach out to her or not. I don’t want to mess up the relationship I have now, but i don’t understand why I can’t get her out of my head. 

Anybody got any tricks on how to move on unconsciously? Any help would be much appreciated!",2023-01-27 07:54:15,723,True
976,Dreams,The weirdest dream I have EVER had ...,"One time I had a dream where I crashed an airplane into a cloud and a sky axolotl came out of it.

The axolotl then turned into a mech as one of the undertale characters yelled ""Look behind you!"" but I yelled to the mech to stay looking forward while I looked backwards.

978,Dreams,dreaming of evil eye,"I know what an evil eye is , and I have some friends of mine that wear evil eye items. I have never wore one or have looked into the whole thing about them , yet I had a dream of one and it had me wondering if it means anything or if im just paranoid. In the dream a guy friend of mine was wearing evil eye bracelets and dropped one on the floor and couldn’t find it. I picked it up in the dream and he told me that since I found it he would give me the bracelet so I wore it. That was the whole dream but it was a very random thing for me to dream about , considering I haven’t seen any evil eye things around me recently and the meaning of an evil eye is important.",2023-01-27 07:39:57,667,True

Then they'd come sit by us and bite our hands playfully,  never hurting, but in the dream you were expecting them to be biting your hands off.

A lot of their fudge was also dirty and covered with dust or dirt. I actually thought the shop was closed at first but then a girl came out of nowhere and asked me if I was going to buy some fudge. Then I saw a miniature cop, like a really tiny police officer. 

Then I went to a diner I think and then I went to a bathroom and I saw a strange silhouette creature in the bathroom. It literally looked like the actual shadow of a person on the wall, and it was talking it could talk with a disembodied voice. I forget what it said but I was accusing the creature of potentially being satan but I wasn't sure what it actually was. The creature was apparently unable to swear, it didn't have the ability to use curse words or fowl language for some reason. I'm not sure what it actually was, but it listened to me and even did what I told it to do and was very responsive and cooperative. It was interesting. And then I woke up.",2023-01-27 06:18:24,1087,True
985,Dreams,I killed a man that travelled through time,I was running around in a mansion trying to set up traps for him and when he came he started teleporting around the place and avoiding the traps effortlessly.

986,Dreams,Recurring dream,"As the title says. It's a recurring dream, but some very slight details change from time to time such as faces, vehicles, etc.

The dream is always the same with slight changes. I'm driving down a road way, and come up to a crowd of what looks like journalists (looks to be in front of an airport). As I approach, they all swarm the vehicle.
One almost always gets the back right door of my car open. Barraging me with countless unintelligible questions. I start to panick, and start to drive off. Right after trying to escape the situation, a car ALWAYS pulls in front of me the exact same way trying to box me in. I pull to T intersection, where there's a cop sitting on the shoulder of the roadway but they don't move. I cross the intersection in the car making a left hand turn, at which time a small group that thinks I hurt the journalist, starts chasing on foot/in their cars.
Usually the dream ends with hearing gunfire, half the time hitting the cars chasing Mr. Others, I'm being shot at.
The dream usually ends there with me waking up with an accelerated heart rate.

Sorry if this is a bit jumbled, confused and riddle with typos. I just literally woke up from that same dream and figured I'd come here and write it down while it's somewhat fresh in my mind, as I only dream once or twice a week max, and it's always this dream.",2023-01-27 05:47:53,1340,True
987,Dreams,I dreamt I am rooting for our Putinist leader,"I felt a bit of shame as I agreed in the dream with the wife of our leader...they have mildly homophobic opinions.
I just feel awkward...of course I know that we are ambivalent...especially in dreams... And I was invited in a foreign country...and my host was a Putinist with a bit of antigay ideas [ on the weird custom of buying babies from rented mothers...]

The dream included articles in 90s papers on the topic...kind of hinting at *outmoded* views. 

But I did feel so good about being accepted by this kind woman. The wife of our trumputinist leader. 
Just had a need to  rant about it. Thanks.",2023-01-27 05:45:35,603,True
