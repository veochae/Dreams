0,i think it was my grandad,so i had this dream when i was a kid age that has stuck with me my whole life i am f and i think about it all the time my grandad lived next door but one to us and we were very close and the evening after he passed away i had a dream that i was looking out of my window and i saw him but he is getting into a spaceship and waving goodbye at me and i am so hyped up to my mum and dad like omg mum dad it is grandad look and they just fully was just so blaise about it like okay and i am looking at him and he said he has to go now and to be good it still brings a test to my eye now thinking about it i guess i want to believe it was my grandad because i was not allowed to his house to say goodbye because nobody wanted me to see him like that at the very end it was different when other loved ones have gone because i got to say goodbye has anybody else had a similar experience like i said i want to believe but i just ca not fully commit to believe it was because of lack of evidence
1,a nondescript blurry figure standing over me,im laying in bed face up where a blurry unknown figure is standing on my torso towering high over me this person was not heavy felt like an easy lbs this blurry face from way above me is downcast and says you are a very ugly man i am gonna crush you this voice was a deep inhuman type with a hint of a growl but the figure was human yet without clear distinctiveness to help identify who is on me the person needed the wall to keep balance while this figure pump its feet on me up and down i was pinned down and helpless what are your thoughts i would like some feedback on this dream that is five years old now 
2,dream my family hated me because i am disabled,i had this dream nights ago and it still has me really shaken up i have a very obviously physical disability irl i have had it since birth and have a large family with no other disabled people in the dream my mum my younger brother and i were on a bus they were sitting in the back together and i was in the front by myself the bus drove past someone on the street with the same disability as me and everyone including my family laughed at them at some point we got off the bus and i was upset at them for laughing and they were saying things like they have a right to laugh and that they hated me for how i am i was pretty much being kept in the family as a pet also there was a random unrelated thing in the dream that actually ended up happening irl the next day i guess i am looking for reassurance that this is not based in reality because i have always felt alienated from my family

4,i had deja vu 3 times last week,for context i don t dream often but when i do i always wake up thinking that was a little too real nothing scary just realistic yet odd situations that could happen in reality in these dreams i sometimes i have people in them who are only silhouettes i ve learnt through my experiences that if i haven t met this person yet they ll show up in my dreams as silhouettes like unlockable characters in a game sometimes the scene would be places i ve never been before until the deja vu strikes i experienced these dreams in reality last week on three separate occasions the same silhouettes now have faces things that happened in dreams came to this is the first time i ve had deja vu in ages but before last week i d have deja vu once in a blue moon what s happening to me

6,dream universe?,first off this is completely genuine and i am honestly asking for other experiences about months ago i started having dreams that take place in a very familiar area that i and everyone else in my dream world understand as and call orlando which is where i live irl it s not quite like how it really is although i go to the same few areas every single time i dream it s always the same never scary literally haven t had a nightmare in months the people are the same usually versions of people i know irl including my real life children interestingly it took several months for my youngest child to begin appearing regularly and now he s always there as well the things i do are very dreamlike but never liminal or unsettling just typical weird quirks that don t exist irl sometimes maybe once a week i ll be in a certain spot in my house or running errands and i ll connect it to the place in my dream world it will feel the same and maybe look the same at certain angles i quite literally haven t fallen asleep and not gone to this dreamworld in months every nap every doze off every sleep i go there has anyone else had this experience i like it i ll honestly be sad if i wake up one day and can t remember visiting this other place

27,"watching dreams in a dream, mind control, telepathy",so we went to an inventors house who was very wealthy he has desensitization chairs so that you could dissociate and join the vr world completely this vr world is the grand connected dream that everyone connects to when they sleep or forever once they die you can connect while awake and conscious so that you have more control in the dream hypnosis is very popular so that you can build hiveminds or just control a single person for a walk of invulnerability or as a tool it also makes you more powerful the more you do it anyways we went down the basement to go watch past dreams to find all the answers to my life and for entertainment it was a big list of titles on a large windscreen with a few dissociation chairs in front we sat down and began to watch the dreams in full vision as we dissociated you are fully controlled by these dreams and are forced to just watch while your in them this was not like the dream world where you can make decisions i could still telepathically talk to this person while in the controlled dream as we watched like commentary back to the hypnosis this also opens the mind for telepathy where you can share thoughts and visions with others and also see and hear them and more about the vr world it has higher dimensions where you can see time like objects that moved are stretched to where they went to and objects that stay still or move just a little have only a little stretch so it makes this big stretched d image to look at you can also connect to dissociation machines in the vr world to play interactive video games where you spiritually control the character in rd or st person we might be in this vr world grand connected dream and are just at a low dimension or later my soulmate telepathed to me in these dreams and it was usually frustrating because they would control me or send me negative energy all of my dreams interconnect with my daily life and are there to teach me things to test me or to show me the future in an alternate reality the more i think about dreams the more i remember past dreams pretty clearly during the day

36,i played golden eggs with the devil,i m sure that the devil is a common occurrence on this sub as he appears in the dreams of many before i start reciting this dream in the part where i want to tell there are events that took place before a specific time lets go over that quickly it ll be very watered down i go to romwe to buy a dress and other clothes while i m waiting for my clothing to be done checking out a fat wheelchair bound lady wheels into the store with a little girl in a stroller she starts violently beating this child so i did the right thing and pushed her out of the wheelchair and start curb stomping her anyway they somehow cant process my order so they threw the clothes into storage and refuse to give my money back i go to the storage bank below store and attempt to find my things and bring them back up well there were a bunch of things there but i couldn t find my stuff as i go back upstairs i pass out this notes my journey before the descent to hell when i first arrived there was nobody it ran as an old parking garage but it must ve been on piston s game day because no one was there i wandered around for a while only in my bra and underwear as a note i usually do not walk around in public half naked so i was also wondering what happened to my clothes i wandered for a time period i cant really convey with a reddit post but it felt like a few hours i turn a corner and suddenly seem to cross the border i see people who seem to be teenagers or young adults so i could blend in just fine i don t recognize anyone i walk into a sort of common area it seems many people are bunched around with each other in the middle there is a man with long stringy hair covering his eyes he looked pale and thin and he really desperately needed a shower i don t know what urged me to but i sat down in front of him on the concrete floor i m sure you can guess who he is i was offered a deal if i win the board game i win if i lose i die there was nothing for him to lose but i still accepted in the first round miserable defeat is an understatement for what i experienced i felt as if he saw the cards through my hands and i m pretty sure he actually could foolishly i didn t ask the rules beforehand and figured welp now or never he was surprisingly accepting and gladly started reciting the rules i couldn t really understand him through his death accent though so i asked him to do a different one like british or something he gladly complied attempting it but struggling we were laughing so much it was hard to listen to the rules the layout of the board is illustrated but i can t post it i will still attempt to explain the rules you have cards numbered the card portion plays out like reverse solitaire thats the only way i can really put it the squares in the middle were reserved for ones twos created by creating a full deck and golden eggs earned by cranking the slots and getting a specific pair of numbers plays out like tic tac toe the slots were cranked when you needed a card the number displayed is the number on the card you receive in rare cases you got a specific number and were rewarded a golden egg when you get the egg the round ends and you clear the board in the second round i get a golden egg in the third round i get a golden egg in round excluding i won a golden egg he seemed surprised to say the least the only times he tried to cheat me were in the first round and in one of the round where he attempted to switch our scores around i did not let him get away with that moral of the story i won that in itself is especially weird to me though especially in dreams i never win i always die or have something horrible happen to me or have my happiness taken away i don t win against the devil i don t win the board game and i sure as hell don t beat him like that also the devil was really chill he was kinda hot too 
37,kinda scary dream i had nights ago,i would not say i am the bravest person in the world but i had my fair share of nightmares when i was a kid i dreamt of various monsters killing me every night mainly it and the ring is girl so over time i gained some kind of basic survival instinct while i am in a dream also now that i am bigger i feel like i can defend myself better but the other night i had a kind of weird dream i was having a videogame like dream there were missiles and it was kind of difficult to explain but it was overall funny and chaotic suddenly though the context changed and i found myself in the bathroom facing the mirror i noticed that my reflection was not there so i got closer to look around the corner of the mirror to understand it i guess then i notice that my reflection was kinda rotated and it was in front of the door i could see myself i dont remember if i was grinning or smiling i have long curly hair so i couldnt see shit lol but i stand back immediately i need to add that i was strangely aware of the situation i knew what was happening and in fact i stepped back and looked at the door and i thought ah ha checking if the reflection maybe got out there was nothing and as long i didnt get close to the mirror i thought i would have been safe then the dream abruptly changes again and i find myself in my bedroom paralyzed it was my bedroom just very dark but there was a red eyed shadow at the other side of the room i dont remember much of the shadow cause i was looking at those eyes they were more kind of bright red dots first i thought to shape a bubble around me to defend myself other times i have been eble to materialize things to defend to myself but i felt a mental resistance like i had to fight against it but in the end i got a bit scared the dream ended and i woke up what do you think about it 
38,is there any meaning to my dream?,i ve had this dream a few times now i m standing on the ground and decide to jump and when i do i don t stop i jump so high i make it to space and then all of a sudden i just start falling fast right before i hit the ground everything goes black i know that i splattered and then i wake up in my dream and try to talk to people but they can t hear me so i figure out i m a ghost and then i actually wake up i ve also been having this type of dream but with different scenarios like i was shot everything goes black before i die and then i wake up as a ghost is there any meaning behind this or is this just my weird imagination

42,zombies in the phoenix suns practice facility,i had a dream that my step brother and i were scheduled for therapy with back to back appointments my appointment was overlapped with some weird basketball activity that took place at the phoenix suns basketball court idk why the suns i m not a fan of them it was more of a practice facility than an actual stadium my parents made me cancel my appointment so we could go to the court which really upset me i was kind of a dick to my parents as we travelled to the court when we got there the power went out this was weird but we were all ok the power eventually turned back on then everyone besides me disappeared i was opposite to the exit in the top row of the bleachers so i started walking towards the exit not running the power soon turned back off my sister came in the gym running and waved at me to tell me she was alive as i was walking down the stairs an old paraprofessional from school was walking up the stairs i waved at her and she responded in a male voice i got closer and her skin was tinted bluish green and then i realized she was a zombie i booked it towards the door being chased by her the door was locked but i kept trying i look up at the window on the door and zombies are on the other side then i wake up
43,thought it was the end,so i had a dream i thought was gonna be the usual but it wasnt i often times have dreams about high school field trips or jjst being back at school and on this particular dream we were pulled over in a parking lot getting food for everyone on the buses i somehow ended up with my shoes off while standing in the parkimg lot and some guy walks kinda close and says he likes the shoes they look like his size he proceeds to try and put them on but i shove him away and he acts like it wasnt a big deal he walks to his car and pulls something out the driver side back seat at first i saw orange in his hands but then he held it up and shot multiple times it was a radio like a boafeng but it worked like a handgun i ran into the nearest building saying i escpaed the shooter in a comedic way but then i see a lil blood on my finger and i see the entrance wound i instantly get lightheaded and start to collapse i pulled my shirt open and it was as if the gunshot happened years ago and was already partially healed this whole time i felt as if i actually got shot in real life every inhale was extremely painful and i have never had a dream that convinced me i was actually injured or dying tl dr got shot over my shoes and could feel the pain in real life moments before i fully woke up
44,i killed my girlfriend in my dream but it was self defense,i want to know what my dream means so i appreciate any responsei was in an older building looked limilar to the building from legacies the school but it seemed to have a clothing shop or thrift store in it and on the other end of the store was a long dining table with everything but food on it plates knives forks candles everything it was me and maybe other strangers in this area and nobody had any issues with anyone because it was all strangers i remember the lights were out besides a dim glow from a fireplace at the long end of the dining table everyone seemed confused at first like they were waiting for something so they were all kinda nervously meandering around i remember just kinda hiding from everyone hiding behind the clothing racks hopping from behind one rack to another trying my best to not be seen all of a sudden while i was crawling in between racks i saw an old lady and i smiled at her and i was not sure if she saw me but there is no way she would not have but she still acted like she did not see me so i went behind the next rack and she walked the opposite way and i suddenly popped up and yelled to everyone i know what game this is its a murder mystery the old lady lunged at people standing together with a knife just before she got to them i jumped on her and got cut a couple times on my arms but i eventually got the knife from her and stabbed her in the ribcage area when i looked up it was my girlfriend she kept trying to fight me and she had another knife somehow and i got cut a lot more than the first time still just my arms i still ended up getting the knife from her and i aimed for the neck this time to try and kill her faster i stabbed her neck and pulled it forward to be thorough and i told her on the verge of crying you know i love you she responded with i know i love you too we have been getting into fights a lot recently and it is not always something bad but it always gets really nasty i have also been in a really bad mental state and it is been about more than just that i had never kill someone or anything like that either i think i know what this all means but i do not want to think that so i need someone else to tell me because i hope i am wrong 
45,am i the only one,i just bought my first house last year now i keep having dreams i am in a house that is not mine but i belong in it if that makes sense like i wake up with strong feelings i need to move into this other house that is not real and i have never seen it before and i feel mentally off waking up has anyone experienced this 
46,i just woke up and had this terrible dream,i was cat school just chilling and my friends were playing gay chicken for some reason than my friend logan was being fat shamed in front of everyone i was the only person comforting him i tried to tell him that its all muscle and stuff the next week i get a video call his skin looks terrible his sacks under his eyes ware deep and he was crying he was going to commit suicide i tried to tell him not but i guess life just took fate 
47,this was weird…,i had a dream that me and some other people were running away from certain people and i think they were killers and i remember me and some friends ran into a bathroom and i found out i was pregnant this dream scared me and i hope it s not true i pray to god and hope it isn t true but yeah it was insane
48,hallucinating while driving,i had a dream where i was driving fairly close to my house trying to make it back but i was heavily hallucinating there were seemingly hundreds of cars heading towards me but because they were hallucinations they went directly through my car the whole dream i was trying to determine which cars were real and which were fake eventually i did end up crashing when i slammed against a car i thought was another hallucination me and the other person in the other car were completly ok after the crash thowhat could this mean 
49,dream that came true,i have seen comments here that dream cannot predict things but i completely disagree when i was i lived on my own i got extremely lonely and depressed i cried and prayed about it sometimes one of those nights a dream i was riding in the backseat of a car on the drivers side my sister was driving my mom in the front passenger side the car was kind of a cream color inside we were on our way somewhere and had a positive feeling someone was next to me in the passenger side talking he was turned way from me and i could not see his face he had dark thick kind of wavy hair he was talking but i could not undersand what he was saying because of his thick accent which i had never heard before when i woke up from the dream the realization came to my mind wow that is my husband and i was trying to figure out his accent was it greek of course i felt happy for a while after that dream eventually i forgot about the dream fast forward to when i was i started dating someone we decided to get married i had completely forgotten about the dream until the day my mom my sister my fiance and me were all riding together to go to my uncle is house i wanted to introduce him to my uncle my sister was driving my mom was in the front passenger seat i was sitting in the rear drivers side and my fiance was sitting next to me behind my mom in the rear passenger side there was a moment where i realized i was in the exact scene from the dream and it all came back to me the cream colored car my sister driving mom as the pasenger my fiance was turned away from me looking out of the window and i could not see his face all i could see was the back of his head and he did have thick dark somewhat wavy hair he was talking in that moment and he did have the same accent from the dream turns out that was an egyptian accent i have always been fascinated by this experience because it is hard to believe that could happen to dream of someone before you ever met them however i believe that his face was hidden for possibly different reasons i read the brain cannot create a new face it has never seen before maybe this is true from a more dreamy perspective maybe the face was not revealed to prevent me from looking for that person or knowing their identity my dreams have always been a bit different i dream in color most of the time at least dreams i remember or become aware of i may have some dreams that i dont remember at all i have dreams that pick up where another one left off in the same settings telling different chapters of a story if you will different settings that i keep coming back to and have a familiar feeling to them when i am in those dreams i have the feeling of recognizing that place i would love to hear any feedback about anything i discussed above 
50,"i moved out of my first childhood home in 2010, and i keep having strange and uncanny dreams of being back in that house.",i was when i moved out of my first childhood home in i am now and i still keep having strange dreams of being back in that house i have crippling anxiety and attachment problems so i was very devastated when i had to move out of the only place i could call home it was like an anchor to my identity while i miss living in that house and reminisce my happy carefree days of living there i eventually came to terms with change after becoming an adult for years i have had dreams of being back in that house each scenario of the dream varies sometimes i break in to tour around the house as quickly as possible before getting caught by the current residents of that house sometimes i am like a ghost walking around the house and no one notices me sometimes i randomly appear in my old bedroom and start searching through the closet for childhood items such as brightly colored purses keroppi or hello kitty plushes barbie dolls and etc some dreams even take place on the cul de sac in front of the house my most recent dreams regarding the house were more strange than ever one was scary and one was wholesome in the scary one i ran through the open garage and walked around the house when i ran back out i saw a man sitting in a car on the driveway the man looked angry and asked me how often do you come here i nervously answered not often and the dream ended there in the wholesome one the homeowners saw me standing in the cul de sac and said hi to me i told them that i lived in their house when i was a little girl so they invited me inside to look around the first room i went to was my old bedroom what i find odd about these dreams is that i have no desire on breaking into anyone is home that is an invasion of privacy dreams have meaning and these dreams must have some kind of distinct meaning if they have been reoccuring for years

62,dreamt of a bus turned rollercoaster ride.,in my dream my bus trip home started off really nice with beautiful scenery of the sea and greenery then as it approached the highway i saw my old workplace and the road became steeper and narrow gradually to the point it became like a degree drop encountered many of them and was grabbing my seat as tightly as possible soon it passed through a few newly made roads with construction still ongoing and somehow the bus went through the railway path even saw a new train station named iron stop or iron path ca not remember exactly that is when the journey becomes enjoyable we passed through underground then suddenly encountered a few waterfalls and passed through them making us all wet everyone started laughing and making small stops and i realized some of my friends were on it made some new friends and finally reached my stop i alighted the bus and realized the whole journey was actually cut short by a few hours would appreciate if anyone could interpret my dream 
63,a dream where a red airplane crashed into a church,i was driving with my bicycle on an island with a very cold climate and pure white snow everywhere and a constantly dazzling sun there were many people and cars and bicycles and streets in a very mountainous area everything was very hilly at the time it was around p m with the sun still out and i was driving somewhere with my bicycle outside the island you could only see an icy surface of water disconnecting the island from anything around it for as long as the eye could see after crossing a very busy street i stopped and took a closer look at this mountain that i had driven past so many times i had always wanted to climb a mountain from my perspective it didn t look nearly as hard to climb to the summit of the mountain i drove up a very steep surface it was basically like a wall all the way up with my bicycle and landed at the foot of the mountain i wanted to climb i should mention i was quite dehydrated at the time but i was so motivated to climb to the top of the mountain i was at the mountain s foot when i saw other people on other mountains further away from me celebrating their victory of climbing to a mountain s summit they wore very thick jackets and gloves and protective eye wear and so on i did not have nearly as good protective gear then i noticed an older lady in her mid s she also came there with a bicycle that also appeared interested to climb the mountain she was a really nice lady we decided to climb the mountain in a collaborated effort as we kept climbing we discussed how we both had been tricked by the mountain s low appearance that made it look like it would be easy to climb it was the opposite and i became very exhausted and was not confident at all that i would be able to go much further i was only driven by my intense curiosity and will to keep going at one point i was pushing on the snow a bit and fell a little into the snow noticing how frighteningly powdery it was the lady helped me out it was then that we looked around us to our left and noticed another island disconnected from ours it was a very hilly island and had little houses all over it and a church and streets and everything that makes up a little island town seconds later we saw a red airplane that looked like it had been drawn with crayons fly suspiciously low above the island next it looked like the airplane had only slightly touched the island s church but it had actually crashed into it both the airplane and church fell down taking down with them a third of the whole island into the ocean the lady and i were in complete disbelief as to what we had just witnessed we couldn t believe we were witnesses of an event like this nothing like this had ever happened this island next to ours had been living in total peace for decades we decided it was time to discontinue our journey for now and go home later that day on github apparently most if not all of the people on the island were programmers i saw users posting about the sadness of the event there was a social media tab where people could just make text posts it said new posts i clicked and read some posts i was still in shock that i had been a witness i wanted to make my own post about how i had witnessed all this and how sad it made me

67,my best friend and i had similar dreams on the same morning,a quick summary of who we are we are both year old males we have been best friends since middle school so around years i am a very introverted person recently dealing with anxiety friend is also introverted but can be extroverted and has recently been dealing with slight depression we are both heterosexual my dream feb rd am my dream started out with me waking up there were people over for my brothers party i got out of bed and started to chat with people in a way that i felt almost like a host my friend who i shared the dream with was also in it but i only saw him once we were speed running mario as it was the video that i was watching before i had fallen asleep as the party went on there was an older couple in the bathroom and the husband was having a seizure they left the party for the hospital and the party kept going eventually people started doing drugs which was not my kind of thing so i decided to go back to bed there was a girl sitting on the floor against my bed and side table with her back facing towards me almost as if she was waiting for me she had shoulder length dark hair and was very still i looked at her and said you know you can tell me if this never really happened since i for some reason recognized the event like a memory but i knew that there was never a party she turned towards me and her face was very pretty and she felt familiar and comforting in a way even though i had never met her she then said to me none of it was ever really real my bedside table had now turned into a deformed black mass with holes in it almost like what you would see if you searched up trypophobia my vision then slowly turned to complete white with numbers that shuffled into words that i ca not remember with loud ringing almost like a flash bang from a shooter game but not as intense words kept appearing and being shuffled while my vision was still completely white eventually i got uncomfortable and started to force myself awake as i realized that i was dreaming however when i awoke i struggled to move almost like my whole body was numb friends dream written by him feb rd am so the dream starts off with me in a local mall i was facing this store front of a painting shop where this lady creates and sells her paintings i walked right in with the intention to buy one to decorate my apartment that i had just bought in real life the first thing i notice is that it is a long room with paintings on all walls with a long table in the middle all the paintings had a specific theme to them all being primary colour dark blue and secondary colour orange i see the lady sitting at the very back of the store working on something so i walk on over noticing she is an average height woman in her young s brown light brown hair caucasian with a pretty face and nice body i start complimenting her work and maybe feeling like i might start flirting with her if the conversation goes towards that direction she starts to act all humble about it and says oh they re not bad and i reinforce my compliment by restating that they were actually cool so she leans in and tells me if you wanna see something cool come with me she gets up and takes me to the front of the store near the door there is a table with a microscope lens thing on the table with some computer gadget next to it she tells me to look into it and i see the number i look at it for a moment and process this number but then start to question the meaning before i get a chance to ask she grabs my left hand and tells me to press this black rectangular button with a little extruding dot in the middle so i pressed it and the number turns to and within a split second of the number changing my vision starts to go pure white and it gets brighter within seconds and i lose my breath at the same time there is a deep bass sound with a high ringing frequency it almost sounded like someone scratching nails on a chalkboard i wake up with my body facing upwards which never happens i sleep on my stomach and i do not move i am not sure if i could have moved or not but i was panting like a dog for air and i could only move my eyeballs trying to process what the fuck just happened a minute later i move and i look around then i go back to sleep on edge after discussed our dreams we came to the conclusion that when he looked through the microscope seeing meant that was for him since he had the dream first and that when the number changed to it was almost like he had to pass on that number like it was for me we would love to hear if anyone has ideas on what the similarities might mean similar looking girl same white light with ringing numbers similar wake up same morning 
68,dream about my father.,hello guys so i had a dream about my father who is very much alive i cut his leg for some reason and i do not know why i saw this dream i also saw him limp and in the same dream i saw my car falling down from a building 
69,tiger at my front door dream,i have no idea why i dream this but i turned and seen a large tiger entering my house by the front door he she was just standing there with the front paws on my floor i got spooked and ushered my family into the bathroom where i realized we were not protected by this flimsy door stuck and made the wrong choice my feelings were of impending doom feeling ashamed at having made such a stupid choice and trying to accept my fate after waking i realized the tiger made no threat and i had no reason to give up so soon but i have never had a tiger in a dream before and ca not think of anything that would prime one to appear i have not been watching any tiger or wild life shows or anything amp edit i should say i usually completely disregard any symbolism in dreams i would think little of who what where and even how anything occurred and focus on what feelings i had but the tiger really threw me it is so out of nowhere for me 
70,had dream last night that there were tiny people living under my blanket and they were racist towards twix bars,the blanket people also kept the twix bars as slaves and then the left amp right twix bars had to settle their differences for a revolution against the blanket people and it was like a western gunfight and after days the twix bars won
71,false awakening loop and weird sensations,okay so tonight i probably had the weirdest experience of my life i had false awakenings many times in my life but they were never this scarythe first dream starts quite normal it was a very average dream set in my bedroom and for some reasons i started eating cookies on my bed leaving some crumbs ofc in the dream then i wake up and of course i m still in the dream but my room looked identical to my actual one there was even my cat sleeping near meso i start thinking about the dream i had before when i notice that there were some crumbs the ones i left in the dream in my room so i freak out realise i was still in the dream and wake up again in this other layer the crumbs weren t there so i was quite confident i was actually awake it was in the morning in the dream but probably also in real life and for some reason i had my phone near me in my bed which is weird because i always charge it and put in on my desk in the night i saw that my mom had texted me saying a random thing about a celebrity she likes i know you aren t supposed to be able to read in dreams but i actually was the only weird thing was that the hours in the messages were off at this point i think i wake up again and the texts were still there so i started getting exasperated because i just wanted to wake upsuddenly i felt my neck pulled back like i didn t have control of my body and i wake up againthis time there was a weird ball of white light standing in the hallway i sleep with my door open so i could see it and when i looked into it my body started vibrating it was very weirdthen i am pretty sure i actually woke up thought about the dream for a few minutes and then fell asleep again as i was too tired to stay awakenow the scenario is different and i am actually getting ready for school when my mom mentions that i would be late for elementary school so here i realise i was still in a dream as i of course don t attend elementary school anymore then the weirdest thing happened i kept waking up in my room for like times like a fast loop i don t know how to explain it but it s like i was going through different layers at full speedthen i felt my neck being pulled again i had my eyes closed and i could only see warm light and i felt my body vibrating like my conscience was coming back into my body i have never had astral projections in my life i know it may seem dumb but i am actually freaked out not by the loop but by those weird awakening sensation it almost felt like i was having a seizure or something
72,if something is on top of me while i’m sleeping i’ll have nightmares,i ll have like a pillow on top of me chest area sometimes and times of out of i ll have a nightmare once causing sleep paralysis to happen is this normal should i be concerned 
73,i was a psychic medium,i was touring a museum stately home i was all dressed up for the occasion in period appropriate dress that was a smidge too long so i was having trouble with the skirts i had fallen over and was giggling about it as i got up and brushed myself off i saw a spirit blue and pale like a will o the wisp just an orb almost with a smoke surrounding it i welcomed it forwards extending my arms like an embrace and the spirit came to me and entered my chest for a second i was floating only and inch or two off the ground and a wave of sadness washed over me this was a small spirit so sad and as i felt their emotions i began to cry it was heartbreaking 
74,had a dream where i was smashing cars with an axe in a parking lot,so recently i have been under a lot of stress and am just now getting some relief from it i am not a violent person so i figure this dream was my mind is way of letting off steam basically in the dream i was in a small strip mall with my wife i think we were going to a restaurant to eat i stepped out of the restaurant saying i had something i needed to do i went out to the parking lot and one of those big red axes you see on fire trucks was in my hand i went up to a few cars and just started screaming about hating them while i smashed them to pieces then a few more cars parked and i smashed them too all the while i was insulting the cars i just stood there for a bit my wife came out of the restaurant and asked me if i was coming in but i told her i was waiting to see if i wanted to smash another one then i started thinking stuff like hm i wonder if the owners saw me do this i wonder if there are security cameras here i should leave before anyone confronts me that was the dream 
75,popping a zit except it's horrifying,i just figured some might like to know that such a horrific thing could even be conjured by a regular ass dream but otherwise there is not much to tell i was looking at the mirror popping a zit i was pressing at it from both sides as you do and it kept coming out until as i continued pressing it began to change color and a lot more came out than one would expect as i cleared away the substance i could see that what remained was my own prolapsed flesh from which appeared strands of what were clearly intestinal worms they were not wriggling or anything but you know them when you see them and yet despite how horrific this was my main concern was others seeing this and giving me shit about it so i stuffed it back in my face and continued with my day lolthe actual craziest thing about this dream is that it was so vivid that it actually registered as a fucking memory i have to rely on the knowledge that it was a dream and that what happened could not have happened to know that it was not real nutty lately my dreams have been becoming a lot more vivid even had one where i was playing hunt showdown except i was the one shooting the guns i had a scoped sparks lrr and was shooting from the fifth floor of a five story building at a trio who were on the roof of a three story building i could feel the trigger pull the recoil and even did the reloading i even had a wacky skin for my pistol where the cylinder and barrel were made using a repurposed food can of some sort but was super polished when i woke up the name silver dollar came to mind since on the hammer side there was an engraving that looked like a coin in fact i could even draw what the gun looked like in fact when i was reloading the revolver the bullets themselves had numbers on the primer from to also when i went to go loot the hunters while my team was off doing something else i started getting shot at by some other team that had been watching their bodies when i took cover i saw six scout bugs flying at me one after another i just sat there fixing heavy bleed for a while annoyed that my team was so preoccupied with whatever they were doing that they could not hear the commotion outside dream veered off heavily after that and i do not remember much except that i almost got run over by an old timey ww jeep now all of this begs the question that second part was a lot more interesting than the first why did not you just make the post about that to which i say well where would i have fit the zit story in lol i figure it is better to follow up utter nonsense with something cool rather than the other way around anyway here is hoping for more vivid dreams getting more opportunities to parse the validity of my experiences is good helps me fair better at regaining clarity in conditions where i might lose it 
76,it's truly hard to believe that there are millions of people out there that don't dream or do dream but can't ever recall dreaming...,so many people missing out on a whole other dimension of life it may not be a big deal to them but i cannot even begin to imagine nights without dreaming i have seen so much experienced so much felt so much that is it almost like a second life to me 
77,[seeking interpretation] sound system in dream?,i had a dream wherein i had stored a microphone and speakers in my attic it was like a whole sound system with microphone amps interface speakers etc in my dream i felt compelled to go upstairs and check the attic space out when i did the entire sound system was set up plugged in and on with the volume all the way up if any sound was input to the microphone the entire house if not neighborhood would hear it i thought to myself i am glad i checked up here if anything fell we had hear it for sure and i turned the sound system off i do not own a sound system i do own a cheap microphone i am trying to sell but i do not know if that is the inspiration for the dream any interpretations 
78,corporate espionage,i dreamt that the company i worked for was hosting some sort of luxury party in the ceo is penthouse where only the higher ups were invited me being a hater of corporate schmucks and ass kissers decided that i was gonna check this party out i get there and then pull some agent type shit where i break in by climbing up a window and sneaking into the closet of a bedroom i put on this lavish navy blue three piece suit and walked right out into that party like i belonged i introduced myself to all these millionaire directors and bullshitted my way through every conversation i made up names places events and rolled with it while all these scummy corporate douchebags spilled their dirtiest secrets to me i left the party and opened my phone which had recorded everything and just posted it all over the internet the whole dream felt like a spy film and it was cool to be the protagonist
79,what are your top 3 funniest/most hilarious dreams?,just wondering but what are the top funniest dreams you have had here are mine van pelt the hunter from jumanji and i were walking together on a forest trail but he was not the intimidating hunter he was in the movie instead he acted like a super hammy and over the top monty python character and was ranting to me about how only certain species of palm trees were capable of wiping their butts after pooping because their leaves were long enough to reach fan palms could not reach their butts to wipe and van pelt was getting super worked up about how unfair it was to prove his point van pelt dropped his pants and wiped his own butt on a palm leaf before handing it to me and shouting you see fan palms ca not do this i just gave him a confused look and set the soiled leaf on some kinda rack on a cavern wall like it was a decorative ornament this dream actually made me cry from laughing so hard wolverine and magneto are fighting each other in the streets of paris in the style of mortal kombat round one wolverine beats magneto and performs a decapitation fatality on magneto magneto is headless body falls to the ground neck stump pulsating in a rather disgusting manner round is where the funny part happens wolverine wins a second time and instead of performing a fatality wolverine begins chanelling the energy of freakazoid and begins to publicly humilate magneto claiming magneto to be mexican even though magneto is portuguese in my dream the following scene happens wolverine runs up to nearby cafe and knocks on the glass alerting the customers hey everybody magneto here is mexican and his last name is hernandez customers stop eating while staring blankly at wolverine wolverine is now suddenly animated like a ren and stimpy character and starts doing a really effeminate looking butt shaking dance while snapping his fingers hernandez hernandez nanny nanny boo boo hernandez hernandez nanny nanny boo boo magneto no shut up no do not listen to him i am portuguese not mexican no was browsing deviantart when i came across a guy who was completely obsessed with the concept of evil elves and gnomes holding world domination meetings at ihop he somehow managed to create and upload his own song which was a complete ripoff of whistle while you work from snow white amp the seven dwarves only the whistling part was somehow played on a tea kettle the only lyrics i remember from the dream was and then they passed the butter before the tea kettle version of whistle while you work kicked in knowing the guy the rest of the song was most likely about evil elves gnomes eating pancakes at ihop 
80,dream about being nothing,i remember that i had this dream a couple of times i can t remember if i also day dreamt this exact dream because my brain used to be on autopilot when i was younger i m not sure when it starts but i begin to remember floating in an empty space i am not a human and i don t have any body i could go anywhere in the empty space and could be anything while being nothing then the dream begin to end and i begin to remember that i am a human then who i am the dream kind of makes me question reality for a little while but i eventually continue my day normally the empty space kind of reminds me of the galaxy map on no man s sky but the empty space is just empty and colorless have anyone ever had the same dream or had one similar to this

84,unusual food dream,i had a dream that i was at a birthday party it was unclear whose birthday it was and there were caterers serving mexican food that chose what you would eat they supposedly had a sort of psychic ability to guess what each person would like what nutrients they needed as i was in line to get food i watched each person get common mexican dishes like tacos and enchiladas when it was my turn the catering lady looked me up and down and gave me an open faced bean and cheese burrito bean and cheese is my favorite mexican food and i felt happy about it but then i watched in confusion as she poured a large ladleful of brown gravy on the beans so much gravy that the beans were practically swimming then i felt disappointed because i was given something i liked but then had it ruined by an unnecessary and unusual ingredient but i felt as if i just had to trust that the lady knew what she was doing and eat it anyway but i could not bring myself to even try it and i threw it away i do not know if this has any relation but about two weeks ago i had a dream that i was at work i work at a restaurant and i had to put away beef broth that we made previously in the day but i forgot and did not get it done in time before i had to clock out i felt very stressed about it my whole shift and even when i went home i mention this dream because it involves nearly the same ingredient brown gravy is made with beef broth i have racked my brain and looked up dream interpretation websites but its hard to look up bean burrito with gravy lol any ideas of what the burrito could represent

87,"unsettling dream last night that every part of nature surrounding us was owned, including including intellectual and creative control.",i wanted to film the sky and trees on a beautiful starry night from a clifftop but any aspect of imagery i captured would be owned by some corporation or another any image created would require me leasing in perpetuity the rights to even create an image let alone share it my cameras were corporate tools that remotely communicated that i stole the sky trees rocks somehow it was the same for painting and drawing don t ask me how but it would be known if landscapes were stolen without registering and leasing with corporate permission the sun moon grass etc there wasn t any place one could retreat and just connect without paying for it

99,had a dream about paganism,i posted this over on r pagan but it was taken down i just woke up from a dream where paganism was becoming more prevalent thanks to vr technology with worshippers mostly hellenists and kemetic worshippers since the olympians and the ennead were onscreen gathering to pray in peace but unfortunately karens and kens kept barging in and disrupting these services making the news fortunately people sympathetic to pagans formed barriers to protect them from the karens that s where i left off in the dreamalso these vr rooms were like party rooms where you paid to spend an allotted amount of time and the karens and kens just kept trying to stupidly wipe away the images from the wall that were being projected from a projector

108,dungeon underneath house,so i need to share something kinda serious but not like triggering or anything just really weird so for the last like years i keep having this dream about some kind of dungeon rooms thats considered hidden or unknown underneath my house i want to know if these kinds of rooms are real or if i am just like going insane or if even anyone else dreams this same kind of dream the point of the dream is that these stone rooms are like really old and maybe even apart of an older house that was bulldozed and the modern house could be your house or mine was built on top of usually in this dream i or you would discover that these rooms exist and go down it at the bottom or near bottom you discover that someone is living there or used to live there but how tf would they live there when this whole thing is supposed to be like hidden they might even be using modern appliances like lights or a fridge even though there seems to be no plugs for electricity electricity was not a thing when this was made also the vibe of the dream is not nightmarish but more curiosity that humans have when rediscovering something really old and unknown to knowledge beforehand everytime i have this dream i feel like i am discovering something made over years ago first picture is a concept of this structure of this dungeon or hidden part of the house second picture is what each room looks like mostly uninhabited there is usually around of these rooms with no light at all inside so usually you have to bring your phone in and take photos last photo is what the staircase would look like amp concept sketch of the dungeon rooms are layed on each other and none as side by side amp dungeon room dungeon staircase

110,i’m aware in my dreams but can’t control them,like the title states i am very aware in my dreams but i can t control them in any way when i was younger i was always the spectator watching rather than living now i m literally in my body experiencing everything i don t think this is lucid dreaming because i believe that means i would be able to control what s happening i m writing this because sometimes i will wake up and feel exhausted probably because my body or consciousness feels like it was never asleep i mean for a little after i wake up my body feels very strange almost confused that the dream wasn t reality does anyone else experience this is there anything i can do to help with the exhaustion 
111,whay does it mean for a quail to just kinda show up in your dream?,so in this dream i was out having a normal day probably doing uber or something like that while i was waiting for something to do this quail just kinda showed up in my back seat acting like it was stuck in the car but it was so calm to the fact i was picking it up and it just never left there is gotta be meaning behind that right 
112,why do i have so many dreams about me ending my life?,it s a major reoccurring dream that doesn t seem to be ending anytime soon i wouldn t consider it being a nightmare though because i truly don t experience fear in any dreams where i kms i don t mind them but i was just wondering what it might mean

117,bad recurring dream about teeth,for whatever reason almost every year i have these recurring dreams about my teeth falling out or maybe just the sensation of it i ca not really see anything or sometimes i have a pov shift to looking inside my own mouth but every time it starts off slow with only a few teeth wiggling out and rattling free until more and more increasingly come up to the point it is unrealistic like i am some sort of teeth fountain or weird shark i always end up choking near the end on the teeth spitting free of my gums 
118,dream about spinning around uncontrollably,i think i had this dream a lot of times i am always in a public place with people i know and just start spinning around and ca not stop and i am like oh not again i am also always ashamed of it while and after doing it could this dream mean anything 
119,attempted heist, please note i am sharing this dream as i have it written in my dream journal which can include grammar and spelling mistakes this is an attempt to preserve the integrity of the dream feb i was on this massive ship or house overlooking a major body of water it was multi story and architectural i found a dog and was with someone there may have been a boat in the shape of a stingray set to auto navigate somewhere important or set to some treasure this person and i were just hanging out when multiple robbers came up they clearly thought the space was empty the person dog and i ran the dog is collar was noisy which made me nervous we made it to the elevator unseen and got on it just in time but it was glass see through and the robbers saw us on word unreadable we got to the third floor and found a room full of suitcases i tried to fit the dog in one but it was stuffed we hid there for a moment before running back to the ship we almost left the ship again but had to flee and finally found grass nd other people i think the robbers were stopped the dog somehow had powers marked flair as long dream but interpretation and insight is welcomed 
120,a girl and trouble,dreams journal jan i dreamed of seeing a school girl maybe she was the same age as me she is seen being bullied by a group of boys in front of the school gate maybe she was injured because she looked scared she tried to pull herself out of their grip and ran as hard as she could and then climbed the high enough gate which is enough to amaze me they ran after her luckily the girl was very good at running away from them i ran ahead of them trying to blend into one of them in front of the fences that were pulled up from the outside i acted like i was being stucked or pinned down to restrain them give the girl a little time to escape further felt it was enough to hold them back the gate opened letting two people in with me they stopped to see where the girl had gone they are confused to lose track of her i took out a butterfly knife out weird they did not suspect it when i took that thing i felt my body filled with heat i did not want to do it but a voice told me to my hand moved and stab the knife into the chest of the person on my left and then into the throat of the other person i turned my eyes i saw a teacher in front of me seem familiar to me and i do not know why i looked at her with a smirk on my face i woke up just with my eyes open not like jumping out of bed or freaked out and i just like nope i do not want to know what happened in that dream next although i sometimes dreams about other bad thing that i did but it is different for this one and i asked to myself who is that girl why did i save her or am i does she need help am i going insane do i need help 
121,dream method in the family,dream method febr my great aunt was a freud trained analyst and has had a dream decyphering innovation based on kabbalah where rabbis used an inner family system with father son mother and daughter these inner roles had colours father critical black son healer red mom balance in blue and sister virgo green as toxic symptoms she had historical figures in each colour like card colours with numbers each also hinting at emotional healing functions so here is an example first poirot the detective is a kabbalist he is a healer son red second war starts i say bye to ex wifes these are moms blue third i say to exwife guru that shouting parents create pervert setups this is a symptom hence green four cogwheel train and a rope if someone dislikes trains it is a critique of traffic so it is fathering hence black the numbers can be done by adding each words letters so each card having an abc letters we do have a word a dream message i will go out leave from the task of mentioning it as it has meaning only for me she has had theories from kabbalists about the colours being hints at different ancestral generations although today we do have computer proofs about colour usage frequency that differs in each generation in those times her husband a generational historian had said each lasts years and now we do have statistics about magnetic sunwind having such a perioficity it is still not accepted generally by historians 
122,why is it so hard to keep track of time in dreams?,i never know the sequence of facts in dreams when trying to write them down i always find myself jumping back and forth between scenes it is like i did not experience those sequences linearly does it happen to you 
123,the most wired dream you ever had hi everybody.,so i had this strange dream which was felt like a sense of lack of gravity and believe me it was as real as not having any gravity so basically you feel upside down and dizzy having this in your mind i eventually start to have strange series of dream it was like your soul not that i have one but for describing better was getting out of your body and practically not like out of body experience and these kind of dreams and when my soul was comming out my neurons kind of vibrating in my head and before the process of leaving body was completed in my dream i woke up and during this i saw like white and blue light like staring directly into sun but in my dream after another experience a dream like this but instead with a different story and in the last one it finally happened as i go through the story of dream at some point i reached a black board and the gravity was shut down i was looking precisely at something that was written on black board and after that i saw device with lenses i drawn into it absorbed and what happened was like a black hole it was surprising to me cause the only way possibly to experience a blackhole and survive is to dream it what i didn t know in my previous dream was that what would happen if my soul would completely get out my body in dream how things go in that point and here it is a blackhole some other things to mention is that dreams kind of make sense even though not full logically like when my alarm rings and i don t wake up i dream of an alarm clock so the main question is what is this iam kind of curious and my muscles were shaking during this dream and even after i woke up like pulling into this shredding black hole my hand just move on their own and do you know something like this or similar to this one 
124,dream bath,important notes i have been sick with a cold and took some medicine before i slept now the dream i was at a party with lots of random people some would talk to me like we were friends it was in a trailer the mobile home kind and there was a section full of couches and chairs then a dining area and a small bathroom and master bedroom in the back this one douche bag kept hitting on me and i got tired of it so i moved to the dining area i laugh and took a couple shots before thinking i need to keep looking i stop at the bathroom to see a guy taking a bath in black jeans casually throwing bubbles on himself but there was not many bubbles i continued to the bed room and there was a guy laying back there he sat up and smiled at me he asked if i wanted to dip in the hot tub i said yeah but there is not one he said there was i just needed to think harder so i thought harder and imagined an indoor hot tub right outside the room and sure enough one appeared pretty sure i just took control of my dream for a second there we got in the hot tub and everything was fine until a guy started yelling that everything was wrong i got zapped to the start of my dream and i rushed to the back only to notice he was back in the bed but my hot tub was getting destroyed it was rotting away from the house and no one seemed to care bed guy walked up to me and said sometimes this happens it is going to be ok and then i woke up i am forgotten a few details here and there between the dream and now but that is all i can recall

132,i dreamed i was somebody else but shot myself?,i had a dream last night where i was not myself but i m not familiar with who i was in the dream other people in this dream consisted of everybody i know including my fiancé and family but most importantly myself in this dream i guess it was apocalyptic and at some point paris hilton was threatening to nuke the city we were in at some point i ended up taking a pistol and shooting who i am in my waking life multiple times in the head before laying down and watching as the nuke hits this is when i woke up what could this possibly mean i have never had a dream where i wasn t myself and murdered somebody 
133,"took a 30 minute nap, my whole body went numb and had the most vivid dream ever",hi there i am new to this and wanted to share this quickly before i forget haha so today i woke up early thinking i had to go to work and ended up not having too because it s saturday so went back to bed and drifted off while dreaming about random stuff like jumping and going into endless buildings i found this set of industrial sets that led down into an old abandoned area blocked off by a green door i took a look inside and saw nothing but old concrete to my right but i felt feared when i was about to look to my left and ran back up the stair as fast as i could while running i could feel my legs actually start getting tired like i was actually running for real then i thought i woke up but suddenly my body was numb and i couldn t move at all couldn t even open my eyes the light outside my window was bright and all i could hear was an audience laughing outside my window while i was trying to open my eyes something in the back of my mind told me whatever you do dont open them yet so i hesitated while still completely numb while numb it felt like i could go through my own body like if i touched my chest i could grab my heart anyways the laughter persisted and panic started to set in so the catholic in me prayed and touched my chest and i just woke up keep in mind i was practically awake through this whole ordeal i wasn t fully a sleep but wow i m definitely gonna pray a bit more before bed or something because man that was terrible 
134,nightmares featuring lights,i noticed that recently i have been having a lot of nightmares centred around lights in particular lights switching on changing modes etc of their own accord they always take place wherever i am currently sleeping which makes them quite difficult to discern from reality in my own apartment i have a set of artificial candles battery operated which feature in these dreams i recently visited my family home and stayed a couple nights in my old bedroom and the dreams then featured a cactus shaped lamp that i have there honestly i am not even sure what exactly makes them nightmares as they are not even all that eventful they begin abruptly where the light in question will suddenly switch itself on when the dreams feature the candles i then use a remote to turn them off but they turn back on by themselves almost immediately while i was at my family home the cactus lamp in these dreams would already be on as i typically have it on before settling to sleep it emits a dim green light in the dreams the light would keep switching to red i had panic and try to turn it back but like with the candles it had change again almost immediately does not really sound like a nightmare on the surface and i honestly struggle to articulate what makes it one it is such a small thing but it feels so stressful the more i try and fail to turn off the light the more i panic i feel like the walls are closing in on me my movements get more frantic and desperate but it still does not work when my partner visits and i sleep alongside her she has noticed that i ll become noticeably distressed in my sleep and she has to wake me up to calm me down i ca not even describe what is so scary about it it just sets off this immense panic and leaves me feeling shaken and unsettled for hours after waking i have a feeling of being trapped there in the dream i do not tend to ascribe too much meaning to dreams but this one is really bothering me for some reason i do not know why it is happening or how to make it stop 
135,i have a recurring problem in my dreams,in my dreams i cannot call i for some reason have many dreams where calling is necessary but i cannot dial correctly in my dreams or i can t get to the phone at all to call if i dial it will be or some other variation of the number that is just not correct i had a dream last night someone was outside my workplace a bank with a gun and i couldn t get to my phone the teller line phone or the panic buttons and it was very distressing what do you think this means 
136,i dreamed i astral-projected,i had a morning dream i dreamed that i left my body and began gliding towards the wall on the side of where i was sleeping i got so close to the wall i could see the bubbles in the paint i remember willing myself to stop gliding because in my dream i feared if i continued getting closer to the wall i d get squashed then i go horizontal in the air right over my body and start falling back into the body i distinctly remember feeling quite triumphant and telling myself wow this is definitely astral projection then for some reason it takes me forever to fall back into my own body like i know that is what i m doing but the feeling of being back took longer than expected next moment i m projecting again but this time towards the ceiling i recoil as i get closer to the ceiling thinking i m about to get squashed because i couldn t stop myself from gliding upwards only i went into and through the ceiling like a ghost and into a dark underground parking like area it s a little hazy after this point and i woke up fully not long after interesting dream for sure 
137,weird...,it is just weird to me how your own brain can trick you just sharing btw i just had a dream where i was walkind up a mountain with friends and one fell off one of the friends walking told me he ll survive and no one else walking with me was fazed when that friend fell i saw it in like a movie scene seeing the process of his body hitting the rocks and bis body torn up at the bottom i was so convinced he was dead but seconds later it revealed it was a dummy i believe the friends walking with me was not my imagination toughts 
138,repeated scenario dream,i dream a lot of being able to fly like every time there is a different dream but in the dream i am able to fly for i e the floor is an ocean but because i can fly using my arms i survive there is a monster on the floor but because i can fly they do not touch me like everything else but i can always fly easily like a bird not flying on the sky but above the ground i always have this sort of dream repeatedly but after a bit my arms get tired and it became hard to stay on the air and i became so nervous because i can fall and the monster or whatever on the ground could reach me today i dreamed this sort of thing and after i woke up immediately after this my heart rate was very high

153,"i had a dream with aphrodite and an anonymous male god and i ""didn't pass the test""",helloi keep having vivid dreams more recently and more often than not they are scary but today i had a dream that i was walking on a busy street and then i was suddenly stopped by some type of policeman holding a gun i surrendered but knew i did not do anything next thing i know i am in a green lush garden and there is a man and a woman there i knew they were a god and goddess the woman being aphrodite specifically they were both naked if i recall correctly but i did not pay much attention to it what i do remember is aphrodite asking me something and i answered do not know the topic but i kept saying positive things then i got this feeling that i did not pass the test and everything started feeling weird and scary now i was put in an institution against my will and i tried to escape several times but the man from the street kept stopping me from escaping i did manage to escape somehow after three or four tries but i also remember unexplainable sceneries from my escape plan with huge platforms and the only route outside was next to a weird airplane so i tried escaping from there but the airplane passengers kept saying the plane is full i did not pay attention to them while i was trying to escape the man from the street transformed into a weird humanoid creature idek and some other security men also transformed like demons i guess but i did not process it like that in my dream there was a lot more stuff going on and i always remember my dreams in quite good detail but i do not think it would change anything if i wrote down the whole shebang here anyways i did manage to escape i think lol 
154,i had a very vivid dream and am trying to figure out the meaning,so about weeks ago now i had this dream and it was uncharacteristically vivid as the title says for a decent amount of it i think i understand the meanings behind the details starts off in my dad is truck we are driving down a highway the driver was my new boss and we were chatting about something unimportant he then tells me that he needs to stop at the store and get his dad a gun so we go to the store which is a mix of some local grocery store and walmart we skip to back in the car i am holding the items bought notably and it was pointed out of my through focus of pov the gun is not a gun this is the first detail that i dont understand it was made clearly important by the dream and was basically highlighted after that there was construction ahead so my boss went off road thru the construction site to get around it down the highway we went this time tho we were talking about something important the second detail i ca not grasp it was again almost shoved down my throat that it was important the dream then focuses more on the surrounding area around the highway with the perspective having changed occasionally thru the dream the final detail i couldnt grasp the surrounding area and landscape was importantly unimportanttl dr in dreams what do the following mean a gun that is not a gun an important conversation with no details present amp a landscape that is importantly unimportant
155,dreaming but still able to see the real life??,i just woke up and i had the weirdest dream and i am not sure which parts are not real i was dreaming that my vision was stuck i was able to move around freely and talk with other people but my vision was just frozen the thing that is confusing me is that my vision was stuck on the exactly same thing i saw when i woke up and what is even more confusing is the vision in my dream got lighter darker because of the sun and clouds through my window which is exactly what is happening in real life is it possible that my eyes are open and looking but every other aspect of my body is asleep i fell asleep on my couch so this is not the usual place where i wake up 
156,don't know how to stop my nightmares,i would like to share some experiences i had with nightmares and i do not know how it is possible i am sorry if it is not the right sub i am new on reddit i would really like to know what you think about it i am french so i am sorry for my english and for the long story it begins when we moved to our family house when i was from the day we arrived at this house i was totally unable to go upstairs alone and this until i was or years old i am still uncomfortable with the idea of being alone upstairs there and i am now it is not a creepy house at all it is a house that was built by my parents so it was new when we moved in i still do not understand why it really makes no sense i always had big issues to sleep and had multiple different habits that lasted for periods of time once i had to sleep with my door open and the light outside on after i had to have absolutely no light and the door close it did not last long and after that still the same today i have to close my door and sleep with lights on or at least outside light coming into my room my shutter have to be open and my bed have to be against a wall i moved in different places through years and it was always the same everywhere my point is since i can remember every nights i have one or more nightmares some bad and some terrifying to the point i woke up screaming and sweating it also happen that some nights i do not see anything in those nightmares only a lot of voices screaming together in my head until i wake up i can have a nightmare one night and it continue like one week or more in another nightmare like i remember in my second nighmare what exactly happened in the first one it was always like that and i was terrified enough to not want to sleep at all my mother kept repeating me that we ca not have nightmares two nights in a row but it keeps happenings even today i think i never had a night without nightmare even if i take a small nap like or minutes i ll have a nightmare i nearly have only nightmares that are totally unrelated to my real life but when they are related to it i am not able to know if it was true or only a nightmare it make me doubt of the reality of some of my memories quite often like i receive some messages or have a terrible conversations with people that never existed but in my mind it will appear as something that i really lived i have no way to know what really happened or not so when i was like or maybe i had a routine before going to bed my room was always extremely tidy to not be scared by a strange shape during the night i had to check in all of my closets shutting their doors checking under my desk and under my bed and rechecking if everything was at its place i had the lights on and the only way for me to fall asleep at the time was by reading a book so that night i fell asleep like this with the light on like everyday i did a nightmare where i was someone else in my house probably an adult and a man all the lights were off and as this other person i was walking through the house with a big knife in my hand i took the stairs going to my room and opened the door discretly when i entered the light was off i tried to go next to the bed where i saw my real me sleeping but i tripped over the rugthat make my real me waking up in the dream i really woke up at this moment in the reality and the light was off when i turned it on again the rug was turned over exactly as it was in my dream it scared me a lot cause it was impossible that i turned the light off and let my carpet like this after my routine i could not go back to sleep for at least an hour but i finished to try again closing my eyes at this moment i heard someone a woman calling my name but strangely it did not make me open my eyes she called me normally twice and screams very loudly my name followed by wake up the third time so i opened my eyes again and was too scared to try to sleep again this night no one was awake in the house i asked my family in the morning if someone entered my room or called me or heard something that night but they all say no another time when i was younger like or i was sleeping at my grandparents house like i did every school holidays at this time i was so afraid to sleep alone that i slept in the room my brother slept in too my bed was next to his against the wall every nights my grandmother read us a story and waited until i finally felt asleep i put systematically my head under the blanket with a little hole to breath rolling up the blanket under my feet to not let anything passing under i woke up during the night for no reason and i noticed one of my arms was hanging out of bed strangely i did not put it back under the blanket and i tried to go back to sleep at the moment i closed my eyes i felt something caressing my hand softly so i opened my eyes trying not to move at all instant later the thing gripped my hand and pull my arm under the bed hard enough to make my shoulder off the bed i took back my arm under the blanket chocked and i listened really carefully during the rest of the night not able to move or call my grandparents but nothing could be heard appart from my brother breathing when the sun lighted the room i finally find the courage to get out of the bed and look under but there was nothing some years ago my sister were travelling in new zeland i only knew this i did not had a lot of news from her i wanted to let her enjoy her trip one night i had a really terrifying dream where i was someone else i entered in something that was maybe a church or something like that and i started to shoot at people there with an assault riffle i killed nearly everyone there it was horrifying i woke up sweating not able to move for a long moment when i finally moved i look at my phone and my mother sent a message on the family group discussion couple of minutes before i checked asking my sister if she was safe i asked why she was asking and she told me that my sister was in christchurch and there were a terrorist attack where a lot of people were killed it was such a strange feeling cause the nightmare seemed at this point more real the strangest part is that as i can remember it was only the second time i was not myself in one of my dreams with the one i told previously most recently like or years ago it was not creepy but i had been able to find my credit card after i lost it cause i saw in a dream it was inside a seat in my car i searched there just after waking up and it was there thank you if you read this until the end i hope it is clear enough for you to understand if you are willing to tell me what you think about that i had like to hear it or something that can make me stop having nightmares all the time it can be great i would really appreciate to have a real rest once it is only a small part of what i experienced with my nightmares

162,dream with weird details,next week i have my analyst session first of all in my dream poirot had a kabbalist name suchet is the actor with a jewish family name and i watch it daily is the numerical version added up it is a in kabbalah we have s like generations or family members or body parts like it is used in r freud of course there are mental issues and healing tools too but first let us see the remaining dream parts saying goodbye to the women in my life due to war mobilisation my ancestors fled ukraine and all gender identity switches including going to the army a macho role are the way our unconscious subjectivity wants to emerge before vanishing again behind the ego illusion i explain to a guru like ex partner woman that yes true anyone whose father shouts will have pervert traits which includes a rebellion against dad and creating new personal rules than i see a cogwheel train and also a rope if someone prefers to go alone on foot a woman kicks me this hints at my asocial and asex pre ego positions now i have an analyst great aunt who was learning with freud so i use her method of intuition helped by colours so the poirot image is a heler red the son in kabbalah the war thing is blue daily motherly rules and the pervert part is a symptom hint so it is green toxic the sister role in rivalries and the train hints at a critique on train masses and it is black father function so the dream parts belong to father son mom and sister she used it with a memory card deck and so she had an abc letter on each card hence she could find a word in hebrew in each dream and claimed the word being a message from the unconscious maybe each card had a function one of the basic healing paths of course this was a playful creative method to teach basic freudist or kabbalist psychological concepts but she died in before she could find any recognition her husband worked in the founding process of unesco but he also died very early in before the official starting to have any impact although there were many other pedagogy projects that were accepted later by them it is a simplified draft of course my great aunt tried to persuade some colleagues but they rejected this playful idea i think i am the only person taking it up after finding hints on this in family letters and diaries i do have a few friends who someone ask me to use this kabbalist freudism so if someone sends me a dream that has distinct elements i am willing to show how it can be done

179,i keep dreaming about eating goldfish,the first time was so vivid big blobs of abstract and squishy goldfish were willing themselves up out of my stomach they tasted sweet and were gelatinous like candy there were seven or eight of them and it was not a short process each flopped out onto the table in front of me a woman was attending to me and attempting to gather the jiggly wriggly fish there were sliding doors and a lot of wood the table was low in some images but in others it was high the decor was traditional japanese or korean things changed in the dream so often that i really do not know which someone was rubbing my back and another woman came over to me with a container of a small breed of baby goldfish there were like a hundred in this container and i just started eating them i do not know if i used my hands or some kind of utensil but it was like i could not stop myself i kind of realized what i was doing in the dream and tried to spit them out but i just kept shoveling them in raw live goldfish they did not taste sweet a woman reassured me that i was doing good and stroked my free hand the next time days later i was having a normal dream and then suddenly i found a container of baby goldfish in my hands again we were watching tv and some woman that seemed familiar but not a person i know in real life was telling me to try them they said i might like them i looked down and i had already eaten half of it with chopsticks this time they were fried whole and the woman smiled and said it was not so bad this time i just popped up from another goldfish dream wtf is going on no lady this time just dinner with again familiar people that i do not know i am eating a dish and just so happen to look down and goldfish are stir fried into the rice looking at me it is like someone is trying to get me to eat them i do not know what is going on but it is been a week and a half of this fluckery i have an interpretation but if anyone else wants to take a swing at it you are welcome to 
180,"i climbed a wrecked tower, witnessed horrors, and almost met god",i flared this as nightmare as it has a very graphic scene involving a kind of child zombie best description i could make without spoiling but i still wanted to give y all a heads up because it is a bit disturbing but it is also very long the light was dim in the last minutes of a sunset there was foliage everywhere heavy and damp giving an oppressive feeling even in the track i was walking on in front of me there was a crumbling tower full of lose stones that seemed to go on impossibly high in the sudden mist hanging around me clinging to every detail of the scene there was a bird singing ominously in the distance and i felt compelled to enter the dampness was unbearable i remember the smell of rot and decay sticking to my mouth and making it difficult to even breathe the bottom floor of the tower was empty with only a doorless opening to stairs that curled around themselves and on the floor were cracked large tiles which depicted some ancient mosaic that was all shuffled as if it were an ageless puzzle i took the stairs and got on the first floor where plants were everywhere suddenly i had a machete in my hand and i slashed at the thick branches eventually found my way to the next stairs those were even more decrepit and i thought i would fall but made it on the second floor there was a child there sitting on the wooden floor looking at the wall on my right he was so so incredibly thin with great big eyes who stared at nothing wearing rags i approached him and saw his distorted belly the mediatic image of famine that i had seen on tv when i was a child and had stuck with me ever since he turned his head towards me slowly tilting it to the side and tried to speak but nothing came out of his mouth where teeth were missing i touched his shoulder asking him to repeat and his skin started to crumble under my fingers rotting as in an accelerated video and his flesh decayed into dust as i watch horrified maggots crawl out of his collapsed body i screamed and yelled and cried because this was too much and then a man appeared he was the same man that had saved my life when i was a kid he looked at me with kindness and said do not worry go on god is upstairs i blinked and he vanished the stairs were right before me i did not look at the heap of gore and went on trying to leave the nightmare behind me and maybe meet god i took the stairs and it collapsed partially beneath me and i stuck my foot in the hole but i wrenched it free and tried to carry on it then began to get smaller slowly every inch forward was closing the walls in on me after a few steps there was no way i could move normally and i pushed a shoulder through the opening and tried my hardest to push through there was sand everywhere getting into my mouth my ears my eyes and i felt as if i was buried alive i closed my eyes and accepted that i would die right there trying to meet god and then i woke up breathing hard as if i had just sprinted for a mile more context on how my life was saved by a mysterious man in comments because this is already hellishly long

209,eye bags and other things,once there was dream where i was falling falling so fast everything around me was a blur all that was passing through my stomach was that terrible dropping sensation that my body refused to free me from once i registered that i wasn t waking up i started to notice castings of dark and light around me they formed an image i ll never forget no matter how hard i wished it away as if the experience was real it was etched to my mind past subconscious and back into the reality of my world left with a feeling there was no washing clean of so there i was so it seemed falling through perhaps colossal shafts almost like tall buildings or concrete pillars with no windows or arches but as i saw them closely they weren t buildings at all more like dimensions of glittery dust i was streamlining between i was falling with my back as stiff as a board looking up above once my eyes focused and locked into what it was presenting itself to me in the scape i was terrified it was a scene from the pits of my deepest despair i was scared not just for my life but for the life of my soul after this the life of my waking spirit it was as if i was falling around body s hundreds of thousands of other people suspended in the air falling through oblivion forever falling at such a speed none of us could move falling so quickly it was as if we weren t really falling at all i still would not wake unable to work out how i got this image in my mind even in the dreamscape i grew frustrated i m trying to leave but i can not trying to turn my head i desperately want to look down towards the doom i m anticipating the fall almost seems worse than the clap of death that could potentially be below as i become more distressed something tears my focus back to what is above my eyes are fixed and trance like somehow i can see myself and all that is happening around me it jumped over my splayed body through the air up and up dancing through space and dodging the falling body s it looked twisted and scary otherworldly the higher i watched it climb the more beautiful the creature appeared to be its body seemed out of alignment to me at first until i realised it was carrying something in the sirens arms it was carrying another one of its kin one that had fallen or perhaps injured i still to this day can hardly do justice to the description of the creature only the way it looked at me when it was feet above only the way i felt when it s piercing eyes of glistening flames looked into mine with disgust deep into my soul through me and on to the rest of the others falling down in to the pits i wanted to die in that look i knew i was below that creature it was why i was falling everything made sense it was carrying one of its own back up it would leave me suspended it would continue to hurry away from what ever tragedy it saw in my casings i can still remember how i wished i was the creature in the arms of that thing the one being carried up and up through the falling sky my heart broke before i hit the ground that was what woke me not the crash of the fall what if i would never be held like that by my own kind what if my soul never felt saved i wanted to go back to sleep to escape the feelings i had just discovered but at this time i was so terrified of my own mind that i could not find peace in rest 
210,dreams of destruction,i had this dream of going to my grandmother is deceased house she was there along with my great aunt my parents are no longer in contact with her my parents and one of my closest friends my grandmother lived in a trailer and we were all camped out in the living room waiting for a meteor shower it had started and we were all excited watching until we realized they were super close to the earth so close we could see every detail of them i studied the rest of the sky and suddenly noticed the moon it was a blood moon we all backed a bit away from the window as the meteors seemed to fly even lower and one actually grazed my grandmother is house taking out a tiny portion of roof on her covered porch we all went to bed not wanting to be around the big window anymore and when we woke up it was over there was no more damage to my grandmother is trailer and we stepped outside my grandmother is property was a huge farm like place and my aunts bedroom brick house was across the yard my grandmother is side of the property was untouched accept for the tiny spot in her covered porch everything else was destroyed there was nothing left of my aunts house except the outline of where the house had been there was debris and destroyed plants all on my aunts side but my grandmother is side was clean and her garden was perfect then i woke up any ideas about this what it means 
211,strange dream last night,last night i dreamed that i was at a dollar store with my two best friends from the th grade we were talking and i mentioned that we should all hang out sometime soon and they should come to my house i bought a carton of eggs from the dollar store somehow and told them we should go play a prank on another kid i knew in grade who was my third best friend and had been my best friend since kindergarten i was standing in the checkout line and we were telling jokes together and laughing just like old times the boys are back in town by thin lizzy was playing on the speaker and it was amazing then my th grade teacher was the one working the checkout and so i talked to her as well all around a pretty great dream but i am curious as to what it could mean 
212,terrifying owls and a strange coincidence,so here s a weird thing i had a dream the other night really messed up one nothing like anything i ve ever had before all these birds were swimming underwater in a transparent barrel of water i had two thin metal spikes an owl swam upwards in the barrel and i speared it with both and then started pulling it apart but it just kept swimming up and ignored the spikes forcing its way out of the water and towards my face scared the shit out of me and i woke up wrote it down right away today we visited the picasso museum in malaga spain went in one room loads of paintings and sculptures of owls weirded out now prior to this really hadn t seen much of picasso s works except for his classic masterpieces no owls and that dream was insane and so intense and out of character for me any thoughts as to anything it might mean i m writing off the picasso thing as mere coincidence but thought it was interesting enough to share anyway 
213,what is the oldest dream you still remember?,i remember having a dream where i was deeply in love with a girl not a real person and then she suddenly disappeared then i traveled a whole desert in a old van bus full of arab indian not sure people searching for her i remember waking up crying because i never found the girl again
214,"my gf dreams about me every single night, and i never dream of her",not an issue for me just find it curious since like the past month every single morning my gf has told me she dreamt about me in a variety of situations and contexts and she explains every single dream so i doubt she is lying or exaggerating this last month i ve dreamt of her about twice or thrice is there any meaning for this or is it just irrelevant
215,recurring dream about teeth,i somewhat frequently at least once a month but often a decent bit more have dreams which are mostly normal and random but towards the end my jaw is distorted in a way that makes it so my teeth push against each other when i try to open my mouth and opening my mouth ends up ripping one or more teeth out it does not particularly hurt but i feel the sensation of them being ripped out each time is usually a little different different tooth or teeth or the specific way they get ripped out etc this has been going on i had say a year or two not entirely sure has anyone ever experienced anything similar i ll add that i am somewhat conscious of my teeth and am fairly scared of having teeth pulled out once when i was a kid my dad had to pull the remaining half of an old rotted tooth out with pliers so it could be related to that trauma 
216,"a dream i had a couple years ago, open to interpretation.",the dream took place in a house that i did not recognize but it was our house live with parents and siblings i think some pretty normal things happened but then all of a sudden the house had burned down i was standing in the middle of the ruins next to my step dad and we were both ghosts or phantoms basically and the remaining fires were purple so it seemed we were in some kind of phantom realm and he said something along the lines of what happened it was just a small fire then in my dream i woke up in bed in the same house crying and screaming because it had felt so real i think i ran to my parents crying and told them what happened then at some point everything was black i could not move and i am not sure if i even had a body to move i believe i was in the void a voice said to me time is beyond death menacingly then i finally woke up 
217,red steps,i keep remembering giant sets of red stairs from my dreams as a child and early teens i would see them out of random places the park in the woods at meadville was the most common but i would never climb them as when i grew near to them i would get uneasy or something would push me back from going up like it was too dangerous i m curious as to if i could see them again would i be led to the same experience or if i would venture upward to unknown dangers within the velvety red the stairs would never actually be the main existence of the dream either it would just be setting patiently waiting as if it knew me beckoning and expelling my presence i remember once i took one step up and saw a lifetime of pain but at that time i couldn t describe it as i was so young i had no idea what i was trifling with and fell back landing on the wooded ground and waking up in my bed with a cold sweat 
218,"okay, this is getting weird.",i posted this dream in r lounge the tl dr version is the combined photos i made sums up the location of this dream which was extremely vivid basically i looked up wishing fountain japan and found this area in kyoto japan that looks extremely similar i do acknowledge that it is possible that i read about this place saw a movie etc but it is still tripping me out i want to visit this place now amp would also love any interpretation or cultural significance of people swimming in wishing pools etc or any thoughts really dreama third dream i had recently i was staying in japan for some reason not a tourist but actually staying with a family in a sort of remote village it was like a semi small town with a downtown type area that was not very big maybe three or four businesses it was a beautiful mountain type town i had a crush on this woman around my age okay but the best part of the dream was when we went to this park that had this huge pond the pond looked partially man made but it had water flowing through and this metal grate at the bottom corner the water was crystal clear and there were these pennies people threw down to the bottom like a wishing well we were having a picnic basically with the pond around feet below maybe a bit shorter you could jump if it was not so shallow i guess you could swim in the pool because one of the kids of the family went down there to swim i saw him jump into the water i was talking to everyone and enjoying myself when i got freaked out suddenly and asked have you seen random name come back out of the water they said no we all got freaked out and called everyone at the park to search the water the area around the metal grate was very dark and deep i said get a flashlight get a flashlight i ran up the steep grass pathways up the hill when i got the flashlight and ran back down i saw one of the japanese men holding the boy with a big grin on his face no one was mad at the boy they were so glad he was just hiding in the grass he was very young basically a toddler they were also not mad at me 
219,hi everyone. first time i’ve had dreams in a bit. i wanted to know if anyone knows or possibly could understand anything this means.,so what happened in this dream is myself a man who i never saw his face and i believe my younger sister fought and slayed a devil at his house it was actually quite scary throughout it and for a little bit i thought the man would die however he prevailed this fight had magic in it it s almost like you could hear the sound of it odd buzzing sounds and such from magical items but when he died there were stones under the porch which is the place we were fighting on a porch on the front of the house these magic stones lit up under the porch that the fight was on after the devil or evil being was slain i believe it was a devil i remember for whatever reason a room in the back of the devils house there were two kids were upstairs one was doing something i can t remember and the other had bags sorted out on the floor which were also glowing which i believe relate to the stones from this i believe that would mean the devil infact didn t truly die i m having a hard time wrapping my head around this and am not sure if this has some meaning into my life or not i must add with the devil i am not religious so it doesn t have to do anything with that realm thank you guys and let me know what you think 
220,this man was supposed to be my father,there was a picture of a man being projected in all of the walls of our house and i was yelling this man was supposed to be my father i wasn t sure what it meant but i knew that it was true somehow then my actual father heard me and asked if i m dr my name and then chuckled to himself as if he knows something next i wake up and go back to sleep i m now watching my family from the outside including myself sitting at a table i m confused about what s going on but i can t move because my mom and aunt are yelling at me to stay in the corner of the room they won t let me move nor will they explain anything then my aunt reveals her breasts and they look bulbous like an animals breasts 
221,i dreamt about murder; what does it mean?,i had a dream last night where i killed someone s sister then i lived with the family and they grieved over it and i had regretted it so much i felt so guilty the entire dream they took me grocery shopping and told me they suspected it s me then the dream ended what does it mean

223,why do i keep dreaming about this girl?,i keep dreaming about an old classmate from high school middle school i just do not understand why since i do not really think about her during the day at all or the previous days prior to the dreams anyone has any logical explanation i started having dreams about her about or years ago usually i just happen to see her or talk to her in the dreams nothing unusual however it happens at least once or twice a year or even more frequently i do not know if it has anything to do with it but she used to be my crush when i was a kid i remember that she was the smartest girl in the class back then she had the best grades she is married now as far as i know last night i had a wet dream about her i was performing oral on her and then woke up with morning wood this is the first time i have a sexual dream about her i am a guy btw in last night is dream she was trying to get me to stay in the country that she is living now my home country and keep me from moving abroad she was seducing me

225,kind of recurring dream,i have been having completely normal and different dreams be interrupted by pretty much the same thing for i am not sure how long it is in the morning and i just woke up from a dream where there was a reaper standing on a bridge i felt i needed to cross i can move freely in almost all of my dreams when i got too close to the reaper he came up to me and there was this ladies voice that echoed all around me like a speaker but i was outside in the open telling me to pick up the item at my feet and throw it at him when i did he disappeared but after he disappeared this lady appeared and i was instructed to pick up a teacup full of boiling tea and throw it at her but i could feel it burning my hands i just thought this is kind of weird and wanted to share i dream just about every night so this has been a really frequent occurrence sorry for bad writing i just woke up and i am trying to just get it all down before i forget incase i do

227,i shared a dream with a girl i texted two years ago.,this is quite terrifying i have never experienced something like this i talked to this girl one time and i asked what crystal would be great to carry around it was years ago she just texted me and told me she had dreamed of me and my son i told her that i dreamed of her too and i could hear my son but could not see him it feels like she was in my dream and i was in hers she told me that my frequency was high i do not know what does it mean and i definitely wanna look into this i shared a dream with a girl i talked two years ago i am confused and creeped out it was a weird dream i was in a house she was next to me i could hear my son giggling and laughing but could not see him on her part she told me she was in a house with my and my son she could see my son we were walking and i fell into a hole and found my son blinked and found myself in a car drowning in the river with the girl and my son in the backseat we were both desperately trying to save my son 
228,suicide dream,i m a straight female but i dreamt that i was laying in bed w my girlfriend and she had mental issues r something and she was convincing me to kill myself with her by popping a pill she was doing out of spite towards ppl i think so i m like ok wake me up when you take the pill and give me one as well i don t want to live without u so we go to sleep andi do not know what happens in between but she wakes me up trying to give me this white pill and then i start freaking out like no i don t wanna die blah blah it was super freaky and i felt like i was face to face w death and the unknown when i woke up
229,"did i had a kind of ""prediction"" in a dream?",so there is this girl i met weeks ago we talked like a lot for one week and we ended up falling in love and we had a date to go but she had a lot of issues with her family and ended up being restricted from going out and talking to me that happened some days ago the thing is the day that happened i dreamt that it was raining a lot here and she appeared by my back door out of nowhere and asked for help and to go in my mom was the one to open the door and when she was about to go into my room i was dressing myself better to see her the door opened by itself and no one was there then i woke up and all that stuff i mentioned earlier happened 
230,sci-fi prison,i do not like being scared by horror but i find their concepts interesting so i ll watch how to beat and movie recaps on youtube so in my nightmare i dreamt i was watching a movie recap about a made up movie it is set in a post apocalyptic world not too far from our own time modern society could no longer sustain itself so cities were mostly left abandoned basic technology like cars became a rarity amongst the public most people had to go to the countryside to begin farming in order to feed themselves there is a government and people seem to fear it like it is omnipresent it has ridiculously strict regulations and civilians are constantly second guessing themselves to not become an outlaw even by accident the farmers have solely focus on work and never get drunk gamble in their off time it is like a modern version of oliver cromwell is england biker gangs and scavengers ran wild while the powerful government quickly sweeps them up they have nothing to lose and have fun while they can there was one big example in my dream of the government is power due to the biker is gangs it is illegal to use a main road for an extended period of time giant hovercraft monitor the roads and if it records you using it for too long it ll begin the warning stage it ll tail your vehicle and begin to fire giant hook shots at the side of the road this will go on for serval minutes and if you do not turn off the main road during that time it ll go for lethal force the first hook shot will tear off the roof of your car and then a second will skewer you that why is the gangs use bikes as they have easier times dodging the hooks if an outlaw is captured alive by the government the worst prison they can be sent to is one on a space station it does not matter if you are a killer or shoplifter anyone can be sent here even if it is a prison it is basically a death sentence the aim of the prison is to drive its inmates insane until they off themselves or are killed by someone else they do this as an example to civilians to make them terrified of committing crimes and making them unsympathetic towards these beastly prisoners there are multiple ways they torment the inmates the walls are stark white and the floodlights never get turned off it is impossible to know it is day or night inmates are forced to wear those plastic masks that almost resemble shopping bags the mask circulates your own breath into your ears so it sounds like a constant wind in your head breathing also feels stale and difficult the living areas for the prisoners use the same see through plastic as their masks every inmate sleeps in the same giant tower where hammocks are stung up at different levels it looks like a spider is web the hammocks have no pillows or blankets their strings are so long they dip and sway with the slightest movement you feel like you can fall to your death at any moment getting a wink of sleep is incredibly difficult outside of sleeping hours the inmates are made to hang out in a mile long room with that same plastic as the entire floor do you remember those rainbow parachutes you played with as children you could put yourself or balls in the middle and stumble as you tried to get out imagine a huge version of that and you were never allowed to leave the inmates have to carefully scatter their weight around or the entire floor wo not dip causing everyone to pile at the centre inmates have to spend all day balancing on this slippery clear plastic with a sheer drop below them the floor will never break but it is designed to always tease it could when it comes to meals guards will just roll food into the plastic pit and inmates have to do a mad scramble to catch them often rioting for solitary confinement an inmate will be placed in a plastic sphere that rolls with the slightly steps making it impossible to even stand up the inmate has to lie there feeling motion sick for the whole day the dream ended with me putting my laptop down and thinking that was a really creepy movie then i woke up and i had to figure out that movie recap video never actually existed i do not know i think this might be based on some phobias of heights and being trapped 
231,dreaming of maggots in my skin.,i was in my dream when i look down at my arms i see what looks like maggots worms in my skin moving around suddenly they start to wiggle out of my skin it doesn t hurt but it scared me i called my mom and asked her to help she grabbed some tweezers and started to pick them out it hurt a little but not too much i was also a little scared i ve never had a dream like this and was wondering if someone could interpret it 
232,bloody weird dream last night - war in a shopping centre,i had a really bizarre dream last night i was in a shopping centre with some friends and all of a sudden a war broke out from there i could only assume i was on the good side and trying to avoid being killed by the bads this shopping centre was getting shot up to shit but i was avoiding getting hurt and seemingly not doing any fighting or shooting myself just trying to stay alive at one point i saw a harrier jump jet doing some manoeuvres above the building people from different parts of my life including people off the tv were popping up in this throughout that had no connection to each other me and a small group were cornered by some bads we did not get killed but the bads were selecting some of us to go with them presumably the rest were released it looked like i was going to be released but then the leader of these bads who was noho hank from barry allowed a child in their group to select one of us to go with them this kid walked back and picked me and i assumed that was because my beard made me stand out from the crowd from that point on i was a reluctant bad guy i went to the toilet in the bad guys lair which was in darkness and flushed the toilet which for some reason was not allowed during this i somehow acquired a revolver and some ammo the good guys came into the lair the leader of whom was someone from my work past she was giving me some shit about changing sides which i had no say in i wanted to use the gun to kill the leader of the bads but the gun only had two bullets in and they were blanks i think then dara o briain irish comedian came in to shoot me but before he did i had to take a turn on this game then i woke up before being shot and i have no idea what happened next wtf 
233,had a dream where i knew a dog genetic code but can’t recall this information in real life even though i’m trying to learn it. how?,i started mirtazapine on the th to attempt to increase my appetite long story i won t go into depth but for the past months i haven t been eating much at all and the mirtazapine has helped to some extent as well as giving me some unwanted side effects that i m trying to ride out i did read this morning that it can cause vivid dreams since starting i m having several negative vivid dream a night every night no other medication has changed anyway i ve been trying to learn dog coat colour genetics as it interests me and no matter how much or how little i read i cannot or so i thought retain this information i even had my dog tested to give me something to work towards and still nothing stuck in my head last night in one of the dreams someone asked me the genetics behind my dog it wasn t my actual dog just some heinz black dog my current dog is a brown border collie and i said he is kb kb which means black i woke up thinking to myself i m sure that s actually tri markings i wasn t sure it was tri but i was almost certain it was not black so i googled and to my disbelief it was black it could be completely coincidental but out of all the genetic codes and colours to me it s very small odds maybe nearly impossible could it be that my brain is actually retaining the information but for whatever reason i can t recall it i ve got various health conditions and i suffer from extreme fatigue and brain fog which i ve always blamed for my poor memory and get angry at it a lot i m both amazed and confused at the same time over how i got it right in my dream any genetic code i cannot remember at all except merle which is variations of mm mm and mm 
234,dream about lucid dreaming,in late i had a dream about lucid dreaming and i know it was not an actual lucid dream because nothing worked how it was supposed to for example i wanted to teleport to star wars and got teleported to a star wars rec room map with my grandma and i do not remember much else
235,"i've been having these horrifically disturbing recurring dreams where i suddenly remember that i killed someone 10-15 years ago, hid/disposed of the body and am about to get caught.",ok so i made this account purely for the purpose of posting my experience with this dream because i desperately feel the need to get this out and hopefully get some insight from other users this is going to be a long one and i am going to include the most detail i can possibly remember so buckle up i want to start off by saying it would be impossible for me to fully convey how this dream felt emotionally it was one of the worst things i have ever experienced i am talking genuinely traumatizing the best way i can describe it is a horrific combination of pure terror revulsion paranoia fear and darkness that somehow came together to create a new distinct emotion that has no name something beyond description the word ghoulish comes to mind for some reason it was a specific variation of a recurring dream i have been having for years details like the time place and the people involved are always different in each variation of the dream but certain key elements are always the same the dream never involves the killing itself it is always a case where i suddenly remember having participated in killing someone either deliberately or on accident a very long time ago usually in my early to mid teens and disposing of their body in some way it is always as if i had completely forgotten about the act for many years but something happens that suddenly makes me remember and the memory always feels so real the remembrance always coincides with this overwhelming fear that i am about to be caught like the body is about to be discovered along with forensic evidence linking me to the scene as i said i have been having variations of this dream for years the dream is always disturbing but nothing like what i recently experienced this particular variation involved two of my close childhood friends from real life i was the same age in my dream that i am in real life but i suddenly recall a memory from when i was it was during the summer and i was hanging out with my two friends along with a third kid who was a fictional person that does not exist in real life despite not being a person from real life i somehow knew exactly who he was including his first and last name which i forgot upon waking up and all these details about his life as if he was a real person i even had memories of him from when we were younger kids he was a year or so younger than us and sort of a loser who desperately wanted to be cool and hang out with us which we reluctantly agreed to my other friend was constantly being a dick to him making fun of him slapping him around and playing mean spirited practical jokes on him again all of this was a memory of the past that existed within the dream not something that actually happened within the dream i suddenly recall a memory of my douchebag friend playing a practical prank on the kid the details of which i do not remember that somehow result in the kid ending up dead the incident took place in a fictional outdoor setting on top of a deforested hill deep in the woods there was an old well that people would throw all sorts of trash down kids would drink out there are throw empty beer cans down the well along with all sort of other things the interior of the well was sort of shaped like a j it curved towards the bottom and went off to the side i remember we threw the body down the well and attempted to cover it up with all the trash down there we later got drunk up there and threw all the bottles down the well to help cover it up even more we would continue hanging out there as we always did and never spoke about the incident again nobody ever questioned us about the kid over years went by we went through high school some of us went off to college etc all of our lives had simply moved on like nothing ever happened i had forgotten about the incident completely as if i had subconsciously buried it away deep in my mind one day for no apparent reason i suddenly remember it my mind starts to become flooded with so many emotions the guilt the extreme fear of getting caught or somebody finding the body etc i started to play out scenarios in my mind like the police finding our fingerprints on the beer bottles in the well the fear of getting caught became overwhelming at the same time part of me was questioning whether it actually happened it was really strange i had no memory of hearing about any police investigation into the matter nor did i remember anyone even talking about the kid being missing i did a google search on the kid is name which i know included a normal first and last name but i ca not remember what it was and found a small online news article published a few years after the incident but was years old by the time i found it about the kid disappearing and how nobody knew what happened to him the article even had a picture of him i felt this horrible guilt while reading it which then quickly added to my fears of being caught because it was the first time i encountered public information acknowledging the incident in some way the next thing i remember i was at a gathering of all our old high school friends including one of the two friends who i was with when it happened i remember i had not seen him in years when i went to talk to him one of the first things he said was do you remember kid is name and i felt this sense of enormous dread wash over me it destroyed any hope i had left of it being a false memory i was suddenly faced with the reality that it actually happened and that we really did it i ca not even begin to describe how terrifying that was amp something compelled me to return to the well where we had hid the kid is body all those years ago when i got there i saw about a dozen people in hazmat suits all over the place there were parked trucks digging equipment and all these huge lights like the ones used to illuminate football fields during night games i saw a guy who looked like a police officer standing on top of a raised platform looking down into the well i saw him raise his arm and point his finger at something in the well i knew they just discovered the body amp the next thing i knew i woke up i spent the next minute or so in pure panic mode questioning whether i really did commit this act all those years ago it took me a while to come to the realization that none of the events in the dream actually happened it was just horrible i do not know if anyone else has ever experienced something like this but i would really appreciate some input the whole thing has really shaken me to the core i had no idea it was even possible for a dream to have this level of impact on someone psychologically 
236,have you ever fallen in love with someone in your dream that you don't even know?,today i saw a dream where i walked around in the old cache a cs go map i left the game years ago i saw a finnish girl when i stepped into the b halls from the dumpster we fell in love with each other we cuddled face to face on the floor sitting while remembering some memories i said to her that i also wanted to study in finland she had a modest calm and charming personality then i woke up know really i miss her i did not even know who she was it was a peculiar feeling 
237,i had very unusual dream/experience.,it was nothing special at first because in that dream i was making dinner with my mom then i started to feel dizzy so i quickly went to my room and fainted on the bed and then i woke up in the exact position i have fainted in my dream my heart racing sweating a lot it was the weirdest experience i ever had 
238,wanting to go home and waking in the dream,so over the past year i have been having these reoccurring dreams not super frequently but frequently enough that i have noticed i keep having them the dream will start with me somewhere anywhere really i might personally recognise the place or i might not i might be with people i recognise random people who i apparently know in these dreams or by myself i could be somewhere nice or somewhere that holds a lot of emotional turmoil or trauma for me wherever i am and whoever i am with i do not want to be there i message or call my fiancee and tell her i just want to come home i do not want to be where i am anymore asking if i can come home now and i am completely distraught sometimes the people around me wo not notice i am upset or will try to guilt trip me into staying at some point during the wanting to go home i ll wake up in the dream at home in my bed at night with my fiancee asleep next to me and a wave of relief washes over me and i can breathe again i realise i was dreaming the whole wanting to come home and that i am home and everything is ok then i actually wake up in real life and i am just there like brain what is you doing any ideas i am so confused 
239,why do i laugh everytime im about to sleep?,i dont know why lately whenever i am about to sleep so i ll dream of something funny i thought i was still awake and i ll realized that it is only a dream because i will wake up from giggling or laughing sometimes i try to imitate my laugh but i could not laugh the same it just so weird i wonder if there is any explanation behind this it often happen lately 
240,my dreams are warnings,do y all know what i mean my dreams can be very detailed sometimes and over the years i have noticed sometimes they predict things that are going to happen in my life even though they are detailed dreams i often ca not had ecipher them in time to alter or prevent things from playing out confused same example dream i am walking into what looks like my local highschool hospital event center all in one i am fucking nervous but i know i have to go inside because of something a meeting turning in late homework i finished school in btw i am anxious the entire time walking fast trying to find where i am supposed to go students start to look at me weird and so does the staff i am making myself stand out at this point i am very lost confused and fucking sweaty running around in a building that is familiar but not quite the same eek wake up later that week my middle school child has a class party and their father was supposed to go but cancelled shit i guess i am going then well i went and it was fine for the first min i should have left after that my child was having fun with friends and not interested in doing the activities crafts together that was fine with me because i am nervous i am crowds i should have fucking left i ended up lost in the high school looking for past teachers to chat with the school had changed drastically everything was new and huge security guards mistaken me once for a middle schooler and tried to chase me back another guard kinda followed me around he seen that i was lost he could have helped me i should not have been so shy and scared to ask for help anyway i was starting to panic starting to sweat thinking i had be sent to detention or sent home on a bus leaving my car in the parking lot nobody believes my age going on apparently they seriously think i am a student teenagers are super scary and super tall y all i did manage to visit and catch up with my favorite teachers that day after making myself look like a fucking weirdo my dream tried to warn me to be cool but i did not realize my dream predictions were comt true until it was too late also i probably would not have been so sweaty if i did not panic run and if just i took my damn hoodie off but i was wearing a naruto shirt and every middle school kid was also wearing an anime shirt so i can see why i was mistaken for one the first time that is just an example of a dream i had and that i shouldve been able to decipher easily i have lots more complex ones what about y all 
241,being in someone else's body,i am a woman and i have recurring dreams about me being in a guy is body living his life failing his last year of college having his health problems never met that guy in real life and never had the same problems in my own life those dreams kept coming to me until one night i dreamt i was stubbed in the leg in the morning after waking up i found a message from a guy i met online years ago and stopped communicating with him for years telling me he is injured in his leg i did not pay attention to the coincidence but when he reconnected with me and started telling me about his life he told me about those health problems failing the last year of college etc that is too much coincidence i stopped contacting him and asked him to never contact me again i ca not take those dreams anymore and i thought that by cutting him off i would stop dreaming of that weird dream yet last night i had another dream i saw myself inside his body again struggling with problems with teeth and financial problems i did not fall in love with him i did not think about him during the no contact years i did not follow him on social media and never felt interested in his stories why does he haunt me i want this to end any explanation will be more than appreciated thanks in advance

253,i dreamt that i was away and my mom liked herself, this is a nightmare that includes suicide i can t change the title but it was supposed to be i dreamt that i ran away and my mom mom killed herself so i always look up my dreams but this were a very specific oneso i live i denmark more specific jutland but i used to live in copenhagen those are so different it s like different states in america both their accent and culture and i get pretty much bullied because i m not from there and wants to go back to copenhagen after years this is not apart of the dream but i think it may be a good detail to remember when hearing the dream i had also moved to jutland years ago there like nothing in the dream were different from here until it started the dream so i was talking with my mom about coming home or going somewhere idk i was talking normally and so was she but i was actually really sad and after she hung i just stopped smiling and decided to secretly buy a train ticket all the way to copenhagen which took hours and when i get there it was weird i also realised after the dream that all the places i was are places i ve seen in past dreams but never reality i had nowhere to go but i found other people my age maybe supposed to be year older than me nobody knew each other but no one had a place to go and we all ran away so we decided to stay together so we just hang out again at places i have seen in my dreams before but when it bad became dark i talked with the other s s and noticed my mom calling me i told to wait and that i was gonna act sad when i took the phone i started being like mom i m so sorry i wanna go home plz help me we talked but as we talked more i started feeling really guilty and sad and it wasn t fake tears anymore and when she found out i was all the way in copenhagen i think she said one sentence and stopped the call quicker than ever i tried to call her back on both messenger and normal phone but i seemed to be blocked and then i just realised that she were gonna kill herself because she was tired of me always doing stupid stuff and because she was tired about trying so much to help when i keep doing stupid stuff so i started calling my grandma since we lived really close also in reality se didn t take it and then something happened in my stomach indicating that it was too late so that was the dream again most not all places where places in past dreams but that s actually pretty normal for me there was only some few new places sitting in a bus on the way to my old house my old house which was also so redesigned i couldn t recognise it and when i finally it a hold of which house it was i was in denial because it was so different and the place where i called my mom and told her i ran away and where i was when she killed herselfme and my mom doesn t have a bad relationship and we ve never had quite opposite i m going through hard times and she s helping me so much she have better hopes in me than i do myself i also have a young little brother and we have no dad it s just us and my grandma not living far away like i m the dream soi do not know what this dream means
254,why do i repeatedly dream of seeing or very recently being a wendigo?,exactly as the title says i have had many dreams over the past two years where i see a wendigo just appear out of nowhere amp stare at me then leave he is always the modern interpretation of a wendigo with some quirks unique to him a skyrim esque werewolf body with black fur except for both arms which are furless with white peach skin like mine caucasian a wolf skull for a head with antlers that simultaneously resemble a deer and a moose both eyes are an empty black abyss and he stands from to feet tall i never feel any fear when i see him nor do i get the feeling i should his presence stops everything in my dream besides me and him he always shows up in a forest but not everytime i am in a forest just that when he does show up it is in the forest sometimes he ll show up in nightmares where i am being chased by something that wants to harm me and the moment he shows up everything stops the dream monsters the wind even time itself everything stops besides me and him then we just observe each other for like seconds it is always very brief and always very profound and i always go fully lucid when it happens after that he simply disappears and the dream is over until yesterday when i dreamed i was him i was in a forest and i immediately understood who and what i was i went in search of people and found that were just walking around i am not gonna go into details on what i did to them but we all know what wendigos do to people and that is exactly what happened in short i ate them all alive once that was done i just walked around the forest it was actually quite peaceful i could bend the forest to my will reshape the environment and control the weather after a bit of this i woke up i am not scared or afraid it was actually kind of fun just curious on why i keep having these dreams and why it suddenly changed yesterday thoughts

256,crazy dream i had 2 years ago,years ago sometime in october i fell asleep and woke up in my bed i was still dreaming i didnt know i was still dreaming so i got up washed and was about to go downstairs but some reason i started floating as if gravity weakened i was terrified because it felt so real and i jumped out of bed this time i was awake it was around am at the time i woke up i realized i was dreaming so i went back to sleep just for the same thing to happen and i almost started crying because it was that scary this time it was around so i started praying cause i thought i did something i shouldnt have and i fell asleep for a rd time woke up in the dream and still didnt know i was in a dream until i went downstairs and started floating again this time i got mad i didnt know why at the time and decided to try going about my day floating but as i got down to the last few steps i dropped to the ground and got hurt it wasnt painful though so i got up and was about to take my bike and go somewhere i didnt know where at the time but i was just going to bike around i dont remember me biking anywhere i just remember leaving the house on my bike i ended up inside a mall with my bike gone probably outside the mall so i walk around in this mall for a few minutes nothing out of the ordinary but i look to my right and see a kid run out of a store and say follow me my name and i was confused so i followed her she was in a full sprint and since i was dreaming i felt like i was running on air i was still running but i wasnt nearly as fast as i can run irl she ran into a food court and i lost her and then i woke up i was so confused after that it was around am when i woke up and i sat in my bed thinking about that dream i got up to use the bathroom and got on my computer as i did not want to dream that dream again fast forward year or in late october i went to bed around am and fell asleep almost immediately as i did alot that day and i was tired so i start dreaming woke up in my dream and got out of bed washed got dressed and went to go downstairs but i felt a weird feeling kinda like pressure i dont think thats the right word but its the closest to what i felt on my whole body as if i weighed pounds heavier i dont know why but at the time i just dismissed it and took a step downstairs then i started floating and it felt familiar but i didnt stop to think why but some reason i was able to see a hud as i looked around i saw a timer to my left saying floatation and it was doing down by the second and so on until it hit i was shocked and didnt know what to do i thought i was gonna explode or something when it hit but once it hit i fell down the stairs i was still floating at the top of the stairs and i got hurt badly but it didnt feel like anything so i looked like i got beat up and then when i wasnt paying attention the hud thing went away and i chalked it up to me just falling i didnt think much of the floating once i hit the ground but then i went to my bike didnt know where i was going to go and ended up in the same exact spot in the mall bike gone and the same kid ran out of the store and said you were too slow catch up this time i instantly realized i was dreaming again but it felt real again so i tried to wake myself up but failed so i started running to follow the kid and i lost her again in the food court but this time i walked around and saw a big square cutout of the wall that the kid ran through and because that cutout had construction tape and stuff around it i didnt think about following her and now that i think about it i dont remember seeing a square cutout in the wall the first time i had the dream so i go sit down at a table and think what do i do when a group of people sit around the table i didnt know these people but they talked to me like i was a close relative so we were talking and eating food and had a good time til i realized i was still dreaming so i purposely fell and hit my head on a table to my left i woke up and the sun was still down i didnt think to check the time as i just wanted to get out of that dream and thats basically it now it may be a coincidence i had a dream i could walk around in year apart from eachother but i dont think its a coincidence that i had the same exact dream with some small changes a year apart in the same month of eachother can someone explain 
257,"wednesday dream at an airbnb with family, ft. toy story, old coins, ps1 games, and more",the dream from what i recall started with my youngest sisters my dad and me walking down a road similar to the one that leads to our irl house with weather looking overcast as it looks irl atm but the road in this dream was a dirt path as opposed to the paved street we live on this was the first indicator for me this was somewhere new at some moment while walking i stopped to kneel and look at something shiny in the now slightly muddy ground wiping the filth off of the object i could discern it was a or silver dime this was not the first time i have seen this same dime it also appeared in my black hole sun dream too for these reasons i keep my irl silver dime beside my bed amp soon after this we eventually made it to our destination it looked nothing like our house and by some dream knowledge i knew it was a place we were staying at only temporarily on the oldschool projection type hdtv we watched something toy story related as it had sid is sister in it finding out the toys are alive sometime after that my dad came back inside apparently back from metal detecting with one of my siblings whom i knew was not inside at that point he poured their findings on the clothed table in the dining room looking to see all of what there was i was looking to see one and it appeared to look like a brown metal disc covered in mercury seeing it more intently i wiped it a bit seeing if the lighter metal was some coating that could come off of it and it did it slipped off soon enough and pooled together below the table the coin that was unveiled showed itself to be some kind of exonumia with the los angeles times written on the reverse and a denomination of below that material wise it seemed to be made of a brass alloy of some kind as some non money tokens tend to be no clue if a token like described above exists irl or not nor what reason it had have to amp after that i went to play some ps on the tv the game looked to be a bit of a mixture of gran turismo and demolition racer the track i was racing on i remember seeing in a demo for one of the gt games but the mechanics of the racing worked the same as dr as opponent racers could be damaged throughout the race this was an interesting mix of elements for a game and it proved to be quite entertaining for me sometime once i finished that i left and sat in a chair or lied in a bed reading a comic magazine of some kind all i can recall from the mag was there being futurama and scott pilgrim comic strips in it dunno if this was anything that is ever happened either but it was something interesting to ponder after the dream amp amp and that is where my memory of it ends quite the mundane but intriguing sort of dream like living a day in the life of myself but in a parallel dimension somewhere out there in the vast multiverse hope anyone reading this can get this reposted to other subs that had find this a fun read i had love if anyone out there can find if any of those things from my dream exist irl d
258,pretty vivid war nightmare,i had a dream last night i was working in a hospital as a dietary aide nothing similar to my actual job and i was helping patients with things not dietary related when all of a sudden i was taken to the top floor that had a huge window overlooking the city imagine a super tall building in brooklyn looking over at manhattan it was then i noticed the city was in shambles the buildings were blown up and there was a full on war occurring the news went on and they said they were barricading the city center so no one could get in our out i started freaking because i didn t know where my husband and son were i called my husband and he said he was near the city center and was not phased at all he was heading over the bridge to get off the island and noticed it blocked i was talking while watching the news and it was showing young people blocking doors trying to keep the people attacking out but they were sacrificing people to do so and it was so sad building were toppling and explosions were everywhere in that moment i could watch my husband grab our son out from his car seat and start running over the bridge trying to escape and as he made it to the other side he was shot in the back and fell ontop of our son i flashed back to the hospital and the nurses around me said i was being recruited to be a nurse instead of dietary and then i woke up thankfully it was am so i didn t have to return to my dream it was a pretty awful dream for many reasons but boy these pregnancy dreams are taking a toll on me 
259,do dreams actually have meanings ?,lately i ve seen patterns in some of my dreams every time i dream about something i really like cars sports bikes i can never get to use them i always do something before using them and when i want to use them they just vanish or are not there anymore yesterday i dreamed that i was going to see my dad i haven t seen him in over years and when i was in his town i never got to his house because the gps kept taking me to random places but never his house in conclusion i can t have nice things in my dreams because they always disappear when i try to use them

266,dream that seems to have changed my life.,so this is my first time reddit post so please bare with me it was saturday night jan i fell asleep on the couch like i normally do woke up around am totally awake got up got the coffee pot ready for later had a smoke grabbed a drink etc sat back down and decided to put on a netflix documentary it was far more engrossing than i had anticipated and stayed up to finish the whole thing by this time it was about am and i figured i should just go back to sleep i lay there on the couch puppy laying between my legs just a normal night eventually i start to doze off and suddenly i m jolted awake no reason just happens the odd thing is this happens about times after these events i finally feel myself drifting again and i can literally feel myself fighting it talking to myself if you will basically talking myself into fighting the urge to wake up it s strange and i ve never had the feeling before but it was like i was waking myself up cause my conscious didn t want me to go to this place i finally start to feel myself fall asleep the moment that happens i m just totally blown away by what felt like sleep paralysis i ve had this happen before although this time it wasent terrifying i almost had like a fuck you here we go mentality i power through it and suddenly i get up but i m not awake i leave the couch and head to the window which is eye level to me i suddenly realize i m looking through my dogs point of view i head down the hallway seemingly in control to the back window i think i knew i was sleeping or atleast on another level i definitely knew i wasent awake then it gets even more strange these next few seconds were somewhat of a blur but as far as i can recall i essentially jumped through the window like it was some portal i end up in a war torn i really don t know what it was almost felt like a ww bunker or even no mans land ww trench warfare scene dark gloomy brown grey possibly artillery holes just very apocalyptic suddenly i end up with a group of soldiers a few really disheveled looking a few looking like they re going to a business meeting very clean black and white uniforms they address me as one of their own like i saw all of this situation go down i go along with it but i also have somewhat of a vague dream memory of this everything that happened here i don t know where i am or who these people are just a memory i don t even know what the memory is was i only know that i had one the specifics become kind of a blur after this point but i end up working for hitler disposing of rockets for a time being they don t suspect anything yet i know i m not allied with these soldiers i m just blending in a double agent if you will at some point they realize what or who me and a few others are and we re allowed to work and congregate in what appeared to be an underground prison cell block this dream ends and i m suddenly sent into a different dream i m a teacher at my school district i show up for work and everyone seems suprise to see me i remember showing up and walking around like andy dufresne in shawshank redemption like i had walked through a world of shit and came out the other side clean the strange part about this is i bought a bottle of bourbon and a case of ben that day normally i would have finished this by the end of the weekend and been out by monday i drink a lot it is now a week later and i still have the same bottle and case of beer i also smoke about half as much as before i only realized this a day or ago when all this came in to perspective i feel like this was my subconscious avoiding the topic then me powering past it and faced my issues through a dream i m not intentionally trying to drink or smoke less it s just happened sounds strange but i m just throwing this out there in case somebody has experienced anything similar 
267,dreamt of pulling the king,last night i had a dream that my friend invited me to a city excursion to the largest building in out city so that we could go to the top and vibe we didnt get to the top though because i soon got separated at around the th floor although it felt like the th there was no fatigue at all despite taking the stairs there was merch on the stairs there were tarot card sets and the like curious i upended one up to find massive white cards i overturned the first card on the deck the imagery was of a white and pink holographic astronaut and beneath it said the king not the king of anything just the king it did not particularly interest me i am quite scatterbrained and flighty in public due to the stimulus but then again i have never pulled a tarot card in a dream and even now i can still envision it in perfect clarity any idea of what this card could mean i think it would be cool if that deck existed irl but ofc i have no idea feel free to tell me your theories 
268,strange dream in need of interpretation,so a bit of background about ish years ago i had a boss who was a very cruel woman she was verbally and emotionally abusive to the point where when she fired me she put on documentation that it was because i was too incompetent to live much less work here last night i had a dream i was in some suburban city that i recognized i knew i had to walk home but i was carrying a large backpack with me and i knew it was a very long way a few hours on foot doable but highly unpleasant as i started on my way home my cruel boss pulled up in a car and offered me a ride home i was naturally suspicious because of her cruelty but when faced with the long walk i agreed to take the ride while in the car she was surprisingly nice to me we did not talk about work or my job or anything but she was still making polite conversation when i had gotten home i pulled out my backpack and she even helped carry it inside after that she left and then i woke up i have not seen the woman in a long time and while i used to hurt pretty badly over what she had done to me i put it to bed years ago any thoughts or ideas tldr my evil ex boss gave me a ride home and was kind to me have not spoken to her in over years 
269,first time i wasn't the main character...,last night i was not the main character in my dream that would go to my dream friend oliver so we were in la going on a blind date but before this we were at a date meet up type facility where partners were matched at random and after the date we would decide if we would continue to go out there was this popular girl he was with while i was with this really shy girl with glasses i was having a good time but he seemed kind of nonchalant so we go to eat and then get in trouble with the law because someone pooped on the road however suddenly a large tornado shows up and i tell the group we need to find shelter but when we leave oliver is not with us and there is this alien bigchill fighting the tornado to where it dissipates then the dream skips to when we accept them as our gf or not when i am in there i notice my date and oliver seem to be more talkative than before alongside his blind date i also realize that he has the omnitrix two and two start to go together my date and his date decide to go out with him leaving me as the fourth weel so he grows a harem it turns out that my date really is not human and was sent to keep and eye on oliver the thing is her true from just the most attractive woman imaginable was gorgeous she wore black threads that emphasized all the curves she had they you know what would pretty much flop around everytime she moved he was romantically involved with both girls i think but treated glasses more like a pet she liked it since that was how her species true nature was i was out and about playing the side character role where i would have a running gag of trying to sneak inappropriate pictures of her this one moment had her doing provactive poses on purpose but she messed up my phone camera to where every picture would be blurry then of course she would laugh at me and saddle up to oliver afterwords long story short i ended up going on a journey being the side character as oliver fought tornadoes with the omnitrix getting support from his harem the glasses girl being smoking hot i tell you and me being thrown to the role of a pervy side character might be my first memory of being delegated to a side character in my own dream 
270,same sort of dream every night,every night in my dreams i have the ability to fly move stuff with my mind and pass through solid walls or glass sometimes in the dreams i have to focus for these abilities to work sometimes the abilities are extreme like i can fly up high in the sky like an airplane other times i can only hover off the floor 
271,i often dream about being followed or chased,all my nightmares or negative leaning dreams are about being followed i do not know why usually it is either some creepy looking person usually an adult spiders or some invisble spear throwing creatures oddly specific i know for context i am arachnophobic and have abusive parents sexual verbal and emotional abuse one of them was about being in a car ride with my mom iirc we were on some empty looking highway i saw a bald dude with a very creepy face he looked like he was in his s s and was a bit overweight first we tried to drive away but he kept on following us and i think he was on the roof of our car at some point my mom decided to swerve to hit him and luckily there was not anything gorey but a bit later there were hundreds and thousands of the same guy walking behind our car trying to get to us all of him staring right at me with his creepy eyes i was scared but soon we made it to our destination and we stopped at a shoe store it was pretty wide and mostly empty except for one or two cashiers my memory is a bit bad i ca not seem to remember the rest this was a year or two ago maybe three around the time i realized my dad was sexually abusing me there was no dialogue in the dream iirc another one this summer was about being in some weird mall like building first i was in the top floor taking care of puppies with some nice looking people and probably also my cousins that was like half the dream but my memory of that is pretty fuzzy all i remember is that there were a few quest like tasks i had to do e g bring something to help take care of the puppies but then i went down the elevator and the dream changed a lot there were many people i knew from both the schools i used to go to and the school i go to now all of them were girls my best friend from my old school and i were going to the bathroom and in there were ish other people and an emo looking creepy girl from my current school that i know very well she said some weird thing in another language and it felt like she was trying to curse us we left and somehow figured out that if we make eye contact with her she ll put a curse on us and warned the others then it was this stressful chase thing watch out she is coming this way everyone departed in different directions we went up elevators and stairs then she was targeting me and my best friend my best friend and i got separated while trying to run away from her i went back to the top floor which was now something like a hotel suite i panicked a little while trying to look for a hiding place and settled for hiding in the bedroom under the bed she walked into the room and without even looking at me she said i know you are hiding under the bed i freaked out and when she turned her back i found a bag and hid in it she then somehow summoned a bunch of concrete around me pretty much trying to box me in i managed to break it with my mind somehow and ran into the tiny bathroom it had two doors which i locked then my best friend appeared and said come here i can hide you somewhere safe there was suddenly a door in one of the walls and we entered another bedroom and locked it too she asked me what do you wish for right now and then i realized i was dreaming it could have become a lucid dream but i was too anxious and said i just wanna die and then i closed my eyes and there were a hundred things rushing through my head i tried to get myself to a calming beach and continue lucid dreaming but then i woke up presumably from the anxiety a third one more recent pretty much a few weeks ago maybe a month i was walking through this weird chain of stores with my mom again like we had walk out of one store and be in another we had go from store to store and then we started noticing this creepy shady looking couple following us they had get closer and closer and every time i had get more and more suspicious of them at some point we were at a tiny store that seemed to sell random things gum shoes even magazines my mom either left for a moment or i split off from her the couple tried to approach me so i ran they chased me and i was in some weird place in between two buildings it was not a dead end but from my pov i could not see what was past that the couple tried to grab me and i think they were either going to attack me or r me i threw my sandal at them and left the dream ended i do not remember ever being raped but idk i have a lot of repressed memories sorry for the long post do yall have any idea what these dreams mean 
272,i keep having nightmares where i'm being chased by something on the staircase?,i keep having nightmares where i am being chased by something my mother monsters serial killers anything while i am trying to go down to the ground floor so i can get help i think this could be attached to my slight fear of stairs in real life but it is not that severe so i doubt it what is this supposed to mean and how can i stop it 
273,solved a riddle to kill an evil door,so i unfortunately do not dream often i sleep well but rarely dream regardless but once when i did dream i dreamt that i was a sort of security detail at a magic school the world seemed like one of those magic webtoon worlds spell circles magic towers demons etc now when i popped into subconsciousness i was quickly rivaled by a demon door monster that was summoned in a bustling hall it looked like a regular door but with like demonic details and eyes and occasionally it opened a portal through it to let demons through and naturally as it was out to terrorize the aspiring witches and wizards i the security detail was sent to annihilate it well that demon door was not having it somehow ever spell me and my associates seemed to hurl at it they all bounced off and hit the walls and ceiling nearly injuring a staff member so we paused and i noticed a demonic glyph along the edge of the door reading a golden sword both short and thin with hurrying haste remove their skin for only then with pelting skill will thou destroy what haunts you still reasonably in my sluggish dream state i was absolutely befuddled by this riddle and so were my security associates after a bit of thinking and the demon door about to unleash more demons i suddenly found the answer a banana oh yeah this was a dream alright someone from the surrounding crowd yelled here and threw it to me i peeled the skin off if the banana and threw it at the door as it squished against the door it suddenly looked down at the fallen banana fruit and looked back up saying damn before collapsing in on itself like a black hole and vanishing with a poof we all rejoiced and celebrated and then i woke up feeling utterly confused on what had happened and even more so astounded that i had solved a riddle my own subconscious had completely made up so yeah very cool hope to have more like it in the future 
274,fetish video of freddy fazbear waking me up every single time,i have suddenly started having more dreams than usual and in every single one i see a found footage esque youtube animation of freddy fazbear strolling up to a streamer or youtuber last night it was moistcrtikal and i wake up almost every single time except last night where i had a false awakening i think its supposed to be some sort of guro fetish video and i get scared because freddy fazbear is gonna chomp off charles whites head but i always look away and wake up its also inevitable that i get woken up by it because in my little dream universe its a big thing in the youtube drama community has anybody else had this kind of pattern where a single thing wakes them up every time 
275,a piece of meat,i dreamt i tossed aside all of me except for a little piece of flesh then moved as that tiny piece while absorbing other things and growing irl i have a problem where my head hurts and i start thinking and doing things i usually would not like sh etc while remembering some bad things in the dream i had an episode of those and because of it everyone hated me i was being chased by people i knew irl that used monsters or turned into monsters i ended in a path in a dark forest that had fleshy parts the flesh was greyish and if i touched it it consumed me there was a red haired girl who was apparently creating some sort of lifeform which was that greyish meat she took me into a house made entirely out of that thing in hopes it would eat me the house would sort of reshape itself on the walls or so in the shape of screaming people and snakes as if it was filled by other lifeforms it had already eaten there was a strange man with a huge head and an open mouth resting somewhere near the entrance connected to the wall i escaped by letting myself melt into some sort of worm like being and going through a small opening then leaving most of my body behind to make her think she found me i slowly gained mass by eating other things like grass or dust people knew i did this to escape and then chased me to use me in experiments rather than to just kill me it was a half lucid dream i could not shape shift as i usually can but the shape of a piece of meat felt just right trapped in a chunk of flesh trying to shape itself into something having the places i could belong into taken away by myself and my disorders or something like that i felt mostly just alone and hurt but some people in the dream would help me or be kind something happened with my mother feeling hurt and trying to help me but i ca not remember what exactly at one point i sang a song made by the screams of a hurt soul it brought up certain painful feelings back to surface been having a horrible headache all day

279,exploding sun supernova,i had this dream somewhere around january th i walked outside of my house to my parents it was only me and them even though i have several other siblings from where we are the moon is visible during the day so we saw it behind the moon was a flash of light then a purple red and i think orange supernova then it began to look white and had that red somewhat green and yellow shine on it that you get sometimes when light hits a camera at a certain angle like a reflection of the colors in the dream my mom grabbed my arm after my dad made the comment nope see there it goes the vegetables and crops i think he was referring to stuff disintegrating because after my mom and i turned around to run i felt every cell in my body disintegrate i woke up to that feeling and the last part to feel it was my neck on the right side did anyone else have a dream similar to this it was also after my friend told me that the star betelgeuse exploded years ago and that we d see it in the sky after another years 
280,most disturbing dream i've ever had.. woke up in another world and instantly knew this one wasn't real.,i had this dream some months ago and despite it not having the most overtly scary imagery affected me more than any other dream i have ever had in my years on this earth i woke up some on kind of table in a small room with other tables but i was alone i sat up and hung my legs off the table i was wearing a drab featureless grey jumpsuit and i was slimmer than i should be i felt confused and began to look around but within moments my confusion was completely gone i realized i left this world but i was somehow completely unconcerned with its loss even though i enjoy my life the confusion was quickly replaced with concern for my wife and daughter i have no children in reality and an overwhelming fear that told me i had to find them and escape this place i rushed out of the room and i was i seemed to be aboard some kind of space habitat with large windows with just black starry space as i ran through some rooms i entered a large commons area with people just going about their day people walking with their children using transparent tablets sitting down talking to each other they did not seem to pay me any mind i slowed down trying to look casual but i seemed to know where i was going my heart was pounding and i was in a cold sweat i got most of the way through the room and a door on the far side opened and through it entered a pair of security guards who looked like they were in a rush as well they immediately spotted me and started running towards me they did not speak i ran out of the room and down an adjacent hallway right into two more guards i tried to pass by them but they were carrying a long black stick and one of them just tapped me with it i felt a slight buzz and then my body just went completely limp no pain i did not feel anything and i could not move they caught me before i hit the ground and started carrying me down some side corridor that looked like a maintenance tunnel i seemed to have blacked out i awoke as i was being placed on a bench chest first that sat upwards at a slight angle with my arms dangling down over the edges i could not move my limbs but i could weakly turn my head and i could speak there was a robot in the room with me doing something briefly on a console it spun around at the waist legs still facing the console it had one normal right hand and a left hand that was some kind of device that had ports on a rail that slid out and formed a shape similar to a clothing hangar if it was holding the hook and it pressed it along my spine i did not feel the contact but i felt an electrical sensation like those suction cups with sponges and a light electrical current used in physical therapy for just a moment and i could no longer even move my head it spoke in a very robotic voice relax everything will be alright i was immediately and strangely disgusted by the statement and i replied something to the effect of the empty words of an unfeeling machine to which it replied affirmative and then the hand device collapsed down into two points and it pressed them against my skull directly behind my right ear i very smoothly over the next few moments felt my perceptions leave that world and enter this one i was laying in my bed feeling extremely disturbed and doubting reality i kept touching the area behind my ear usually when i wake up from a bad dream which are very rare for me it is usually because i become aware that i am dreaming and i always close my eyes and say no and force myself awake and it is very abrupt this was so gradual it really freaked me out the fear and need to find my wife and daughter was so intense i had to reflect on that dream for some time to find as many holes in it as i could so i could make myself feel better about believing it that it was just a dream eventually i found enough but still like i said not the scariest imagery i have ever had in a dream i have dreamt i got attacked by aliens and such but the fear in my dreams never felt quite so real so intense and that smooth transition from dream to waking where i did not seem to lose continuity of consciousness ugh anyway it felt good to put that out there thanks for taking the time to read it edit i ca not edit the title should have said while i was in this dream i was convinced that the waking world was the one that was fake not that i still believe it is after analyzing it 
281,murdering a woman, intro i have never experienced these type of dreams before and i have never dreamed of killing someone before a couple years back when i was a little younger i remember dreaming of crying to my parents about losing a small pet now i have become more desensitized to empathy and gore this dream had just happened today i have tried being christian and have had a questionable relationship with god sometimes i blame him for the things i have done and sometimes i pray and thank him for creating this environment just before i had gone to bed the time was the angels are telling me i am in a bad environment but they are helping me guide to the right path this is not uncommon and almost happens everyday dream i ca not recall most of my dream but i do remember it being set around my old house near the kitchen it was a bright day and i could not see past the windows they were filled with a bright white light i was arguing with a woman who was slightly shorter than me and looked familiar all i can recall is that she had long straight black hair it started escalating to physical harm until i finally snapped and took a nearby tool and started stabbing her with it i kept stabbing her until she fell on her fours she was crying and begging me to let her go but i digressed and yelled at her to shut up it took a nearby knife that was long enough and and i started to poke the point towards her adam is apple her whole spinal cord was exposed and i put all of my effort to cut it open once it did snap in two it started to bleed a lot a lot of stains were on the walls and she started to slow down i did not see her die as i rushed myself into the bathroom to look at myself i looked in the mirror and i recall panicking these lines i murdered her i am a sinner i ran out the bathroom cussing unsure what to do and then i woke up outcome what really scared me is that when i arrived at school i was told some younger year had a kitchen knife in their backpack and one of my friend is moms had died from a heart attack both at the same day i had this dream i need opinions if all of this has meaning or not and i am really worried about it

285,time in dream,i had a dream not going into detail but in my dream i was with some family members around not sure but i was in a big open room with a round table i said if this isn t a dream everyone tell me the time and not in together almost the whole room erupted with almost like asking a crowd of people something at a assembly another experience in the same dream i had someone in my dream convincing me it wasn t a dream after i had told them i thought it was any thoughts i haven t found anyone online with a similar story 
286,curious if this was a comfort dream or ap?,a few months ago i have had a handful of these monochrome dreams where i was in my normal first person viewing and also third person like i am the one doing these actions or watching someone else do them the first instance i was lying down and it felt like someone was shining a bright light in my eyes it felt so real and was so uncomfortable i thought my sister was messing with me but we do not do that anymore the second it felt like someone was smothering or hugging me really tightly the third i was sleeping and could feel someone press into my mattress near my legs and behind my back each dream only occurred once but they share similar themes of black and white lighting and the different povs last night i dreamt i was trapped in my bedroom the lighting was very dim and yellow pink like my desk lights my door and the windows would not open and i remember feeling very out of control and afraid then i sensed another me in the room telling me to go back to bed i could not see her perfectly but i could just tell i laid down on my left side and heard her hum and feel her kiss around me then she touched my back and i felt it and everything felt like it was melting and i was gaining control again could this have been an instance of astral projection or just my subconscious trying to calm me down and could this one connect to the ones i had had months ago 
287,"i dreamed i was in charge of preventing a mass shooting and i failed to take action, even taking off my security clothing and me fleeing the scene. the assailant confronted me but did not shoot me.",in my dream i was a well armed security guard for a department store i saw a person entering through the front doors they saw me i saw them i walked away and pretended they were not there i feared she would shoot me in the back they started shooting customers with an ar i made my way to a backroom and begin to take off my security clothing so i could not be blamed or related to the scene i escaped out of the back door and went home the next day i would be shamed and plastered on national news as someone that failed their community i felt great shame in real life i do not work as a guard or police

291,a dream experience i've never had before,i do not know if anyone cares about the details i might make another post about it but the other night i had a dream that has haunted me and messed with me ever since it was a crazy experience i have never felt before with a dream and that is that it felt so real everything about it felt sincere and euphoric with the events that happened and real and when i woke up at first i felt happy but it quickly changed to confusion and discomfort and left me depressed 
292,can you help me understand this dream??,backstory all my life i have had very lucid dreams i usually remember them i started smoking pot in my teens and my dreams were very suppressed i barely had any it was somewhat comforting because of how intense they always were there were times when i would quit pot for a while and my dreams would ramp up i started writing them down i almost filled an entire journal but decided to smoke again because it freaked me out anyway i am sober again and i have decided to stay sober its been about a month and a half and my vivid dreams are ramping up again dream last night i dreamt i was sitting in front of a vanity and there was a woman sitting next to me to my right i got the impression she was a shaman or a witch she was thai that is what i knew in my dream do not ask me how i just knew i think we knew each other she was helping me remember something or trying to convey a message to me she leaned over and inhales a huge mist of green and her face changed to a demon type green makeup mask it was like her face shapeshifted i was not afraid she spoke in a very calm tone and mumbled something to me i ca not remember what it was just then my husband came home in my dream with a coworker when i looked back at the woman there was only a man with a beard and a small woman i did not know they sat there in silence i woke up aftremath i was looking at different thai masks and makeup her face was painted like yaksha i have never seen this mask before today i will also note that i recently started wearing a jade bangle for good luck its probably not related but it did come from overseas before you say its because you stopped smoking pot i have always had crazy vivid dreams like this i will probably start recording them again thanks in advance for any insight 
293,honestly had the worst dream/nightmare of my life recently,context when i was in the army i had met a lot of people that felt like family to me they were the best people i have ever met and i miss them everyday still i left a few years ago to pursue a better paying job through college i was dreaming of them last night i dreamt that i was with them and they were doing army things logistics paperwork pt drill but they could not see me i think they were all really happy and i wanted to be with them but nothing i did in the dream got their attention it stung real bad to not be noticed by your former best friends to have lost that comradery then everybody marched on without me i was just a ghost or something in both the dream and in real life i probably do not matter to them anymore i woke up in a cold sweat and felt devastated this dream was very vivid and i do not think i want to relive it again if i am being honest thanks for reading
294,bad thoughts,this is a question and i m not sure it s allowed here but i am honestly lost so turned to reddit to try and find an answer so ever since i was young i have had these dreams and before we start it s nothing interesting but my thoughts these dreams are terrifying and one of the most scary things i have experienced but i don t actually know what they are i was thinking maybe something like a panic attack but i don t have any illness or anxiety that i know off but i remember going down to tell my mum one thing and that was bones i just kept repeatedly saying bones while sobbing and then she took me back up to my bedroom and i fell back to sleep there was another time i woke up and texted my friend hey have you ever seen that ad where thousands of people die while trying to get into a store i read the text the same morning and was horrified as i don t even remember writing it please if someone has a shared experience please share as i have never met anyone with the same issue no ptsd no mental illness history

296,frequent apocalyptical dreams,i do not dream that often or at least do not remember many dreams but the ones i do remember tend to be apocalyptic example last night i dreamt that i watched a planet sized asteroid hit another planet could visibly see this from earth so the planet was very close to ours and this sent massive shockwaves across earth and sent everything into chaos huge chunks of the ground were rising earthquakes fire etc and all i could do was run down a street and hope i do not die another example is running through a dystopian wasteland trying to avoid aliens that had invaded the earth and killed most of the planets population i really wish i could draw animate all of these things i dream but unfortunately i am not that artistic does anyone know what this could mean is it something to be concerned about or needs to be addressed 
297,i’ve never had a dream like this let alone one i can actually remember,i was outside in a field during the daytime and a women who i have never seen before approached me she looked wild not homeless but wild she was a bit taller than i am i m had long unbrushed black hair whiteish gray clay or paint on her skin that was chipping and was wearing something made of old cloth i m struggling to describe it but something that looked like it was from the th century like old cloth with no patterns on her forehead was a black v like tattoo i have been trying to find the exact symbol online for over an hour and i can t find it the strangest part about it is that i know this description sounds kinda scary but i felt safe when i saw her she told me she was my mother i feel like it s important to add that she looks nothing like me real mother who is alive and well and we have a good relationship i believe she was some kind of magical being witch or demon i really don t know but she wasn t human but again i didn t feel scared and i m the type of person that can t watch coraline or nightmare before christmas let alone actual scary movies i don t remember anything else that was said or if anything was even said between my mother and i then my alarm went of i hit snooze to finish my dream but when i closed my eyes i was in the same place with my mother but now some random person i know was with us they said to me who s you are friend i remember i smiled and didn t hesitate to answer this is my mother and turned to look at my mother who was standing next to me but now she was dress in normal clothes with brushed hair and her forehead symbol was gone i just stared at her in awe since a second ago the women looked how i described early the random person i know said to my mother it s nice to meet you oops it likes like you have a spec of dirt on you are face and reach over to get it but when she started to rub it i could tell the speck of dirt was actually part of her forehead symbol that was peaking out under a layer of makeup used to conceal it then i woke up so yeah please lmk what you think this means or if you have any idea who or what was in my dream convincing me they were my mother

311,weird dreaming while sleep stages change,i had a dream last night that had polar opposite genres the first part of the dream was relatively reasonable compared to most of my dreams ww had broken out the usa government set a draft in place the st names to be called were less likely to see combat a lot of names were called the nd we re more likely to see combat some names were called the rd were definitely going to see combat a few were called my husband and i waited anxiously as the list was read we felt relief as the last name was called and it was not one of ours just before we could relax we hear a knock tier special opps will probably die in combat a secretive tier that only those involved know hello sir is your name erick ray yes yes it is you have been drafted for the th tier horror i watched as my husband stood expressionless they didn t give him any time to think come with us sir i ran to the door as they took my husband from me there was a line of other men just standing nearby with the same lifeless face the other ones chosen as soon as the officers and my husband reached the other men they instructed all of them to head out wait i cried is that it you re just taking him one officer stepped aside to deal with me as the the rest of the officers and drafted men kept walking we know this is difficult ma am but it must be done this way have a good day no time for goodbye what about his things the officer proceeded to walk away ignoring my inquest stop they kept walking in that moment i understood the government was going to get there way and there was nothing nothing i could do about it and if you can t beat them join them so that what i did i ran up to my husband and joined him the officers stopped the line and angrily stood up to me i couldn t hear what they were yelling everything was just a blur all i did know was that my husband looked at me horrified my love you can t be here you can t come with me this this is a death sentence if i can t live with you i chose to die with you the next part of the dream was kind of fuzzy i know we did some training and i know we saw combat i survived but my husband disappeared i must ve switched sleep stages at this point because the dream just gets bizarre from here myself and some surviving soldiers started collecting our dead i couldn t find my husband everyone else dead or alive was accounted for my heart sank there s no other reason that he wouldn t be with us unless he was captured or injured in hiding somewhere i took other soldiers and started frantically searching for him i ran through every building opening every fridge and cabinet just in case he was in one after awhile with no luck i decided to check in the museum of taxidermy and puppets i walked past the still puppets of policemen and circus goers i walked past stuffed tigers and bears suddenly i stopped in my tracks a giant stuffed borzoi dog the dog with the long face sat alone in a room quietly i sang mimidoitforyou and then i knew my husband had to be close by he s always close by the mimidoitforyou sound i asked one of the soldiers to check the men s bathroom that was right behind the stuffed dog he slowly swing the door open and there sitting on the toilet pooping was my husband i fell to his feet and started sobbing i thought i lost you forever i cried i had to poop he said for whatever reason this dream felt real enough to make me wake up my tears felt real i must ve been moving because my husband still half asleep put his arm around me and snuggled me close i felt happy and safe as i drifted back to sleep 
312,so many vivid dreams in one night! (and sleep paralysis),second half the night i kept dreaming a short while waking up and then falling back asleep and each dream was wildly different from the next dream about zooming through a farm field of plants watching these millitary generals doing the same around me they were judt sliding really fast in their feet without trying to move or walk almost like they were surfing but without a surf board also they had no shirts and were all men then we got to a neighborhood with these massive magnificent trees i thought they were like elms but at least twice as tall as usual i spoke oh i know this place should be safe here but then someone with me said they were not so sure then some kind of enemy artillery fire began to rain down on us the trees began to break and fall over they looked like they had mourning faces with gaping mouths in the shape of their trunks and branches as they fell it was then we all realized we had to turn and run away one shot of enemy fire whizzed past my left ear narrowly missing me i then happened upon a young woman laying on the ground paralyzed in fear i told her she had to go in order to live she then got up but still did not move so i gripped her tightly and told her we would move together dream about switching cats between rooms this is a thing we do in real life because one cat does not get along with the others well he was in a room with someone he did not get along with so i went to move him my room was a complete mess huge stacks of things all over the place and belongs strewn about all over the floor there were lots of cats as well far more than we own in real life many scattered as i opened the door a small yellow orange kitten remained at the corner of my room in a built in shelf dream about replacing pillowy bandages on my dad is back as he lay face down on his bed while tool is song vicarious was playing dream about wanting to get a broccoli beef cheddar snack mix or stir fry at walmart or something and they were all full of rolls of toilet paper carefully and meticulously unrolled to surround just the smallest amount of shaved beef and nothing else then a person i was with grabbed one of them and revealed a large set of dvds the toilet paper began to blow on the wind and a light was shining from it then a really beautiful song i had never heard before complete with lyrics began to play but the song was familiar to me within the dream two sleep paralysis experiences as well one where i perceived either the word liar or deceit written on something in the middle if my vision before i snapped out of it and my seeing it filled my with a sense of existential terror and dread but of course i could not move or get away from looking at it then later i woke up again to a small figure like a child that looked menacing and scary when i snapped out of it i realized it was a shirt hanging on my closet door 
313,can’t stand still in dreams,i ve always had super vivid dreams and for as long as i can remember i am constantly bouncing up and down or around the room the entire dream no matter what the scenario is even if it s just a one on one conversation in a room i will just be bouncing around in circles lol it probably sounds weird but it s honestly exhausting waking up with it on my mind sometimes has anyone else experienced this 
314,"i dreamed up a horror movie called ""day one"", a nonlinear narrative about sinister happenings at an english country retreat.",the protagonist was played by anya taylor joy title card day one ext café in a scene lit by morning sun the protagonist and her boyfriend discuss having just arrived at the idyllic estate and what they will do for the next seven days title card day four ext outdoor skating rink a montage plays of about people ballroom dancing together on the rink the protagonist alone is aware of the cut from day one to here and the cuts within the montage and repeatedly expresses her confusion and distress title card day zero int old fashioned bus an older woman drives a crowded bus on a wooded trail talking to the protagonist in the passenger seat establishing backstory they pass by a minor disturbance in a car parked by the side of the road too quickly for us to see what is happening as dialog continues the bus passes under a bridge briefly casting the driver and protagonist into shadow when the sun returns the driver has vanished and the protagonist is driving the bus terrified she briefly loses control and pulls over she decides to check the bus is dashcam to anchor herself to reality she sifts carefully through her memories and realizes the car on the side of the road was being robbed at gunpoint but when she checks the dashcam it simply shows a loving father helping his family load a large umbrella into the car this is where i woke up but i could totally see this skipping between major events of the different days and the protagonist trying to piece together the puzzle out of order before it is too late 
315,i had a dream like the matrix,it was actually like a mix between the matrix and like lsd in my dream if you ate a white powder you could see the world as it really is my eyes turned kind of bionic i guess they looked like a video game with lots of data about everything that i looked at and everything was so much more vibrant i was sitting in my backyard but it was like it was on the edge of the earth and there was a bonfire going beside me and it looked like the bonfire was raining slow moving shooting stars all around me and it was so beautiful and calming and relaxing i wish i could just stay in that dream forever just sitting there and watching the vibrant colors of gold raining down all around me with the night sky and the stars above me 
316,made a joke in my dream,last night in my dream i told someone you re so bad at cooking you could make a soup taste dry and i was so proud of it actually making sense that i just had to share it somewhere usually my dream jokes don t make any sense at all hope this is the right place to share

320,i was 2 hours late to work because of my “dream”,i can t find an answer anywhere for what type of dreams i have so i am gonna ask here i have always had these weird dreams that i call fixation dreams it s usually about something that i was thinking about a lot of researching about that day or it will be completely random i don t really know how to even explain them it s like a day dream all night i will wakeup so much durning the night to where it kinda feels like i was up all night even when i wakeup it s like my mind is fixated on it still and even believes it s true the dreams aren t really dreams with pictures tho it s mainly black in my head but with thoughts there will be a bit of real dream picture type while i m sleeping but mostly it s in my thoughts it s so uncomfortable because i want to sleep so bad but my mind like needs to solve find out fix whatever my dream or fixation is about for example last night it was about me trying to find out if i had cancer on my hand i think so i was talking to doctors hospitals other people with the same cancer because i had to find out i m not gonna go into exact detail but ya it s just really uncomfortable this morning my alarm went off for work at something and i woke up to the alarm and literally thought to myself well obviously i m not going to work because i have cancer i need to go to the doctors not work so i went back to sleep of course then i woke up again at something and looked at the time i was confused at first and couldn t even think about anything because the dreams are so draining i eventually realized i was so late for work even when i m awake for the day it s like my mind keeps shifting back to the dream and i ll sometimes mix it up for reality these dream types things make me late for work like once a week and it s so bad i seriously can t control it and it makes me seem so irresponsible does anyone know what these dreams are and how to stop having them 
321,dreams vs reality,does this happen to anyone else i ve stopped talking about it in public because it just isn t received very well one day i also a manager asked my general manager about a fellow employee i said hey didn t you tell me that you re making him a supervisor and she looked at me like i was insane saying that she would never even consider that the other manager in the room also said the same thing however i very distinctly remember having a conversation with both of them in that same office about making him a supervisor it was then that i realized i may have dreamt the entire interaction which isn t surprising as my dreams mostly consist of daily normal experiences or situations with this instance in mind i then realized that it s been happening more and more example i ll walk into the kitchen in real life and begin looking for a specific appliance that isn t there but i dreamt it was there or i had purchased it same thing with furniture being rearranged amongst other things
322,a dream about my crush taking a bath with me,i need help to determine the meaning of a dream i had last night i was with my crush on some kind of vacation we are very close friends so this would not be a new thing however it became night all of a sudden and i said that i need to go take a shower and they followed me to the bathroom and we started talking while i was undressing i did not feel like i had been violated even though i was completely naked in the bath i started trying to pull the shower curtains to get some privacy but everytime i turned back around they would open the curtains and continue talking it happened like times and the th time i turbed around they were naked and started getting in the bath with me i was startled and felt embarrassed but as soon as they got in i felt comfortable again then they put their left hand on my right breast and looked at me and sat down in the water and i sat down with them too nothing happened that was explicit between us it was just us sitting in the water and as soon as i started finishing up and got out the water that they were in started getting dirty can someone please help if this has a meaning

324,dreams and memory,last night i had a dream where i was having a conversation with someone someone i have never met or seen my brain just made up a new person while discussing different things and common interests we got to talking about the subjects we studied in school and what grade we got for each subject the weird thing is when it was my turn to list my subjects i could not remember the last one i was desperately trying to remember what the subject was then the guy said was it a language type of course then i said oh yeah of course it was french how did he know before i said it if he inferred from all the other subjects i listed before all non language subjects how would he realise this before me i am the one having the dream so surely i should realise at least at the same time as the other guy really made me think about how memory works my only explanation is that i knew the forgotten subject then my subconscious was trying to push me towards the answer but i honestly do not know what do you guys think 
325,werewolf with machinegun nipples,i had this dream a while ago i was trapped in an old mansion made of stone and stained glass windows and they were chasing me down i then had enough of the fear and turned into a werewolf with machineguna instead of my nipples and hunted down the monsters one by one i have been practicing lucid dreaming and it is helped me take control of my nightmares but this is definitely the top strangest and surreal dreams i have had 
326,unexpected pregnancy dreams,to clarify i m a f and currently not in a relationship and definitely no way of being pregnant now or in the near future it s been two dreams where i ve been unexpectedly pregnant the first dream started off calm as i reminisced living in an old house with my family even my dad who is now passed on we were just hanging out in the backyard until randomly i was pregnant i wasn t shocked in the dream but more so accepted it there was no mention of any baby daddies nor boyfriend i just was pregnant had the kid one boy blonde hair or bald i do not know i ve had reoccurring dreams when it came to pregnancy or kids and it s always been twins or a baby boy with blonde hair and he was just laying on my lap peacefully when i woke up it kinda rattled me since i felt very peaceful thinking that if i don t end up with someone having a kid by myself would be seem that bad the second dream was different it was in the same old house and this time again i just was pregnant but at the same time as my godsister we are both expecting and it s all exciting until we are waiting to be induced i m not sure if that s correct terminology but we were just waiting for the water to break and we were at the hospital but also my old house at the same time btw also no mention of baby daddie or boyfriend when we were waiting my godsister was fine yet for me the nerve set in mostly about giving actual birth it kinda stressed me or more so gf cold feet i can t remember if i gave birth or not since i woke up it just felt odd dreaming of pregnancy back to back almost 
327,angel of death,i had a dream that i had a young daughter and we lived in a cottage it was nighttime and she was playing in the garden before bed i could hear her talking to someone outside so i went out to see and she said she was talking to an angel a tad disturbed i asked her to come inside and get ready for bed and she insisted on talking to the angel again i went to lock the front door and saw an eerie grey angel figure somewhere between concrete and skin with large parts of her facial skin falling and crumbling off as i looked again she was gone and i hurried to my daughter panicked i looked over to the window and once again the angel stood there staring at me i didn t know what to do and consciously thought what would i do in a horror film and went to call the police the line was dead so i picked up my daughter and ran to the car we drove off down a country lane lined with trees she was sat in the back in her bumper seat falling asleep i felt relieved to get away from the cottage but as i drove the angel appeared in the passenger seat beside me i asked the angel what it wanted and it told me it was here to take my daughter it was an angel of death i asked why and the angel said i had been hungry for success in the past and the only trade could be my daughters life i asked if i could trade my own life instead to save her and the angel agreed so i pulled up beside a lake and told my daughter to wait there for me with the angel as i went to the shop i drove off accelerating into a tree to take my own life then i woke up in a hospital bed and found out my daughter was dead 
328,dream/sleep fact # 33 of 365,i am going to post a dream sleep fact every day for daysfact some research has shown that the brain is processing of time during sleep is different than it is during waking hours during sleep the brain is less active and the neural pathways responsible for processing time are less active which may contribute to the distorted perception of time in dreams

330,oof what a wild dream,the dream went from fun house party to needing to escape captors in the dream i walked up to an older wood built home like a farm house on a deserted road surrounded by trees with friends to go to a house party the party was in the nd floor apartment when i went to go up the stairs i was greeted by people hanging out on the deck at the top of the stairs and the stairs were blocked with wood pallets they laughed moving the pallets letting myself and the others i came with in the apartment seemed normal enough but the hosts seemed very odd i stepped into a bathroom and as i was closing the door i saw someone i knew and cared about i called them over into the bathroom to ask them what the heck was going on they told me i need to get out this place is not good just then i noticed a camera watching us and learnt the whole house was rigged up i knew i needed to escape with this person i cared about dream person no one i actually know but i had to be subtle so the cameras did not pick up anything and alert the weird hosts captors just then there was a knock on the bathroom door i acted jovial like i was partying blowing off the weird host that was checking on us my person walked away somewhere into the apartment i then sat at a desk and made a greeting card it looked like a folder on the front and inside i wrote to my beloved the weird host asked me some questions about it as we both admired the card while this was happening i started wondering if the pallets were blocking the stairs or not i put the card down and started acting drunk and silly with my person moving out onto the deck at the top of the stairs trying not to alert any of our captors to our pending attempt at escape suddenly there was a car that crashed infront of the house in the dirt parking area i started acting like this was the most amazing thing i ever saw grabbed my person and started going down the stairs that were not blocked to pretend to look at this car one of the people that were originally at the top of the stairs tried to stop me but i pretended i was a tippsy fool that had to see this car i got down the stairs with my person and we walked up to the road our captors followed behind us i knew i needed to do something so i walked infront of a big rig that just happened to be coming down the road it missed me and did not stop our captors started horsing around and that is when my person grabbed me and said we needed to run so we began running our captors slowly started coming after us but we were faster until it started feeling like i was trying to run through sand i then started running on all fours which ended up being pretty fast and that is when i woke up

335,"weird series of dreams i had, zack and cody in a horse costume in class, cooking tacos in the microwave, and forced into the back of a classroom with a microphone recording me despite needing to be absolutely quiet.",they were vivid kind of like when i had covid and i have been experiencing covid symptoms for the past few days even though i already had it at least twice i mention that because it seems like when i ve gotten sick i had stranger more noticeable than usual dreams and i virtually never got sick until stupid covid was unleashed upon the world which obviously destroyed my golden immune system so first dream i remember zack and cody in class now i think they were supposed to be the actual dylan and cole sprouse as kids and i was one of them i m never anyone but myself in my dreams and we were in some kind of horse costume but our heads and upper bodies were uncovered and we were still sitting horizontally next to each other i was trying to get to the page the teacher told us to and being a dream it was all mixed up nonsense the page numbers were like l lv xv and not even in alphabetical order the other twin unsure which was me and which was the other quickly scrolled to the correct page for me as the entire class was mad and impatient at me taking so long to find the right page i think i was supposed to read it out loud i opened the drawer under the desk and there was like somehow a mini hallway further then the length of the desk filled with blocks of i assume maybe cheese or crackers and spider webs i just barely remember there maybe being a mouse running down the drawer hallway cooking tacos in the microwave at work i work in a grocery store in real life i was there and so was my mom grandmother and other family members i was supposed to cook tacos for dinner except they were premade with shredded cheese and lettuce which certainly isn t supposed to be cooked and i was supposed to cook them specifically in a microwave they were surprisingly only slightly soggy because like the hallway in the drawer dream laws of physics being forced into the back of another classroom different from the first dream and recorded despite needing to be completely absolutely quiet i ve actually had a lot of going back to school dreams pretty much since graduating high school usually i m still my real life current age now and it s the teachers and principal acknowledge that i graduated but for some reason i m supposed to continue th grade anyway which makes no sense when taken literally it s not college or otherwise continuing education in this dream the teacher instructs me to go to the very back i got the sense this was college which i ve actually only taken one semester in real life of the class like that spongebob episode where misses puff sends spongebob to the very back of the class for being blamed for patrick s big fat meanie drawing of her it s visually exaggerated how far back he is in my dream there was actually a wall physically separating the main room and i could barely hear anything for some reason we were also sitting on those grocery cart scooters that are supposed to be for handicap people in real life kids and even adults use them out of laziness or goofing around perhaps to make tiktoks or just to be lazy but we were specifically supposed to sit on them in class for no clear reason they also had microphones on them and when i made a comment that it was dumb to have microphones on them specifically because it was booming loud for the rest of the class to hear everyone looked at me and told me to shut the hell up what a stupid feature requirement i then blew in it to test how sensitive it was everyone immediately turned to me again shut the hell up i then picked up my shit and walked out announcing this was ridiculous and i would not deal with this shit in a massive hallway with a yellow tent not tint roof or something i yelled uh oh in a mocking manner i then had the dumb urge to yell even louder probably waking up in real life but i fought realizing it was just my ocd what a strange realm i wonder what bizarre bullshit i ll experience tonight 
336,strangled a coyote or wolf that was stalking me,well this was a fun dream i was sitting in my car waiting on a friend i noticed a wild dog like animal walking around the car this thing looked hungry i tried calling my friend to warn them but they would not answer i had to do something otherwise my friend would be attacked i got out of the car and had it follow me into a nearby lit garage it followed me inside and began to circle around me growling and drooling then i jumped on it and knocked it off it is feet i wrapped my hands around its neck and squeezed tightly it was fighting hard to get away but with every minute it was getting weaker and weaker after a few minutes of that it threw up on the floor of the garage fighting for a breath then another minute or so went by and it vomited again getting weaker and weaker it got easier and easier to continue choking the life out of it my friend found me and saw me fighting this wild animal the animal threw up a couple more times in a matter of a couple minutes and then stopped fighting all together it was lifeless lying on the garage floor my friend helped me drag it out of the garage outside onto the driveway then i called the police my friend had watched me kill this wild beast with my hands now at am i get to try and go back to sleep it was weird because i saw the animal as clearly as day in the dream but i could not tell you who the friend was that was in the garage with me i could not even describe to you what they looked like but i knew that person i do not know what it is called but i was seriously focused on just the animal i was dealing with at the time the reason i was there was not important to the dream even though that was the reason i was there in the first place weird i do not know what this dream means but i hope it does not mean i want to do something weird those usually do not make any sense 
337,strange prediction dreams?,this has been bugging me since november when i had this dream i have no idea if it is completely random or actually has any kind of meaning but i have been thinking about it a lot because my dream told me with text and narration and everything and i never have dreams like this that on february th and it said something will happen and i ca not remember that part unfortunately but it possibly had something to do with me being drugged by some stranger because it came up after that so ok i do not have to go out on that day in case it actually has any meaning but the really concerning one and i have been debating whether to post this or not because i do not want to be blamed if people freak out but the date is really close now so i wanna talk about it is in the same dream days later i was hanging out with some guy at the beach in seattle and then the water starting shaking a lot and i was like oh no and went to the top of this hill that was really far away ik i would never get there in time irl lol and i could see the whole city from it and heard glass shattering and metal creaking and then my dream put up the same kind of text and had narration again and said on february th and earthquake will hit seattle and then the really weird part is then later in my dreamed i dreamed everything before that was a dream within that dream and then i was sitting next to someone on this bus and telling him about that and how it was so crazy that i had this prediction dream and then he looks at me and tilts his head down to look at me over his sunglasses and says something like how do you know you are not dreaming now and then i woke up well i heard recently that there is increasing seismic activity and i was like no way i really hope nothing that bad actually happens just had to get this out since the dates are so close and i heard about that yesterday but i just wanna put a disclaimer that it could all just be a weird dream and i really do not want people to be doing anything irrational and blaming me because that is why i did not wanna post this months ago also part of why i am posting this is to see if anyone else has had strange prediction kind of dreams 
338,extremely vivid dreams?,i love to dream i am not addicted to sleeping i am addicted to dreaming every night it seems like i have extreme vivid and weird dreams it feels like there is like my own action packed not always movie theater in my head it has always been like this for me does anyone else deal with this or know why this happens i have already googled but like come on no one has figured it out by now lol

344,some wierd dream/nightmare i had a long time ago,so the dream started with me in a very bright and colorful store i was walking around and was pretty lucid in the dream about halfway through walking the store i remember i saw some funny yellow toothbrush and looked over and some door in the wall down the aisle i walked over walked inside the door and saw a destroyed yellow tinted extremely long school hallway and at the end was a really tall creature then it ended a good image of what the store looked like kinda of what the hallway looked like but not destroyed torn down 
345,dream entities and cataloging,so i love learning about religious and mythological entities throughout the years i ve tried my best to catalog them this has lead me down many rabbits holes from jung s archetypes to gnostic personifications of the æons and so on and it got me thinking about dream entities not just the background characters but the one that really stick out for instance i ve had to deal with mysterious orphans that where running away from abusive people weird but wise cartoon characters and consciousbut static universal background that watched me as i drive a bus through its space so the question is are their currently any catalogues of dream entities and or have any of you experienced any that stick out that you have personally experienced 
346,vivid dreams for 2 months,not much has changed in my life nothing extraordinary anyways but constantly for the past months i ve been having very vivid dreams almost every night sometimes more than such dreams a night it started somewhere mid december some of these dreams have been extremely terrifying last night is the reason i m posting this here i dreamt of some kind of extraterrestrial beings chasing me down for days the fact that i remember this detail from the dream is odd in itself it ended in a very disturbing way i m not gonna post the dream details here because all i m seeking are some answers i m not someone who gets afraid easily but these dreams have really shaken me up for the first time in my life i got myself some sleep aids hoping it will help has anyone ever experienced such a phase in life any guidance or insight would be appreciated 
347,creepy woman in the woods (1/3),i have had about dreams were that lady or the place she is probably connected to appears this first one i ll be talking about is where she had the biggest influence and ended up terrifying me forever i am used to walking in the middle of the pure darkness its a strange hobby yeah but as soon as i remember about her i immediately avoid staying in the dark dream we just wanted to play it was probably midnight me and my brother were playing ps at our house there was no one else home and our room only had the tv as a source of light at some point i suggested playing gta san andreas and i got pretty excited i sayed something like oh this game has lots of easter eggs i have and ideia to make you interested in the game i am going to download a few archives from it and then show to you it seemed like i had learned how to download pngs and jpegs from a game so i put a pendrive in the ps and started downloading contents later i took the pendrive to my computer and opened it i immediately pressed ctrl a and then somehow put all the images on my phone it was taking pretty long for the archives to finish transferring to my phone so i started looking into the images one image in specific caught my attention it was the image of a woman in a white dress covered in what seemed to be blood in the middle of a forest during the night i could barely see the woman because the blue rays of the moon were shining pretty intensely on the photo so after downloading all of the images into my phone i immediately try to show that image to my brother an attempt of which i was unsuccesful the photo was gone my vision faded to blueish black and then i read the following words that night the two brothers died within seconds with that image of the woman slowly appearing until i woke up the worst part of this nightmare was when i woke up i for some stupid reason decided to mock the nightmare i stupidly sayed to myself no one dies that fast stupid silly dream like some dumbass movie cliché i did not expect to be responded i heard an extremely deep voice inside my head say wanna bet my soul started leaving my body for about seconds like something was trying to kill me until i covered myself with my blankets and kept saying i can die pretty fast i can die pretty fast we all die pretty fast until the sun started shining again moral of the story do not act like nightmares wo not hurt you in any way

352,bizarre dream about actually dying,so let my preface this by saying i don t dream often but when i do it s usually very vivid i ve been having strange dreams the past couple of nights which is fairly unusual for me i ve had dreams about dying in the past but i usually wake up right at the very end before it actually happens two nights ago i had one where i was crushed in an avalanche and right at the moment of impact instead of waking up it felt like i blacked out but was still somewhat conscious in a weird way hard to describe when i did actually wake up my ears were ringing and i had a gnarly headache for about a minute it was very distressing for several additional minutes but then i felt totally fine until i went back to sleep this exact same thing has happened to me once before a few years ago but instead of being crushed by an avalanche it was getting hit by a train another interesting side note when i woke up again later for work instead of feeling bummed out i was actually in a great mood i remember also being in a great mood after the first time this happened to me has anyone else had a similar experience not asking for a deeper meaning or anything just curious if anyone has experienced a similar phenomenon 
353,weird dog dream.,a couple of days ago i had this dream where i was in a classroom and i was sitting next to one of my friends and there was a dog i think it was a pitbull sitting on the desk between us and then all of a sudden the dog yelled out danm as if it was catcalling someonethen everybody in the room started looking at me then i said the dog did it
354,sand dunes and a giant hand,i had a strangely vivid dream last night which hasn t happened to me in a while i m fairly spiritual and this has been nagging at me i was with another person travelling across an endless desert that spanned in all directions i knew where we were heading was dangerous but it was necessary and the only way to go for safety so we pressed on tracing footprints in the shifting grains a large dune laid ahead of us which we struggled to overcome and once on top kept heading to our destination i went ahead first since i had more energy but felt the ground begin to rumble whipping my head back around behind me i stand frozen as something begins to emerge from beneath the sand a large hand with three extra fingers and part of its wrist stretch out into the air and swipe moving towards me i scream and begin to run away hoping i can get away in time then i wake up

357,reoccurring dreams i've had,every now and then i have been having these reoccurring dreams they are nothing bad or truamatic just strange that i keep seeing these places one is that i keep dreaming about going to the grand reopening of toysrus i loved that place as a kid and spent countless hours browsing through the stores seeing all the toys as a kid and it broke my heart to see that they went bankrupt and closed all of their stores here in the u s my guess is because i had a big childhood attachment to that store that i still think about it subconsciously another place i keep seeing in my dreams is the lego store specifically the one located in downtown disney at disneyland resort i think this one is just because i really liked that place when i went there and wish i could go again 
358,dream that i smoked dmt in mario land (01/31/23),my ex and i were in this mario land looking place there were activities and events everywhere with hundreds of people we met this guy that had large dmt shards and asked us if we wanted to try it we both agreed i was trying to find god we stood the crystals up on their edge and fired propane from a camping torch onto them then started inhaling with straws poof sparkle sparkle went the little fireworks in the darkness of my closed eyes and that was it i was sad i did not find god 
359,having nightmares about non-scary things that i can't wake up from.,hope this is appropriate to post here never used this sub before but i am kind of desperate lately i have been having a dream about once a week where i am doing something completely harmless and unfrightening but while i am in the dream it feels like a nightmare i ll wake up and rationally confirm i had no reason to feel afraid but while i am in the dream it feels as bad as any real nightmare i have ever had at first it was just sort of a weird occurrence i did not think too much about but the past few times it happened i have also been feeling trapped in the dream normally if i have a nightmare i just wake up and be able to move on without issue but these dreams i have been stuck and unable to wake up for what feels like days or weeks even though when i do finally wake up it is usually only been hours since i went to sleep additionally i have noticed when these dreams happen once i wake up i have to take a couple minutes to ground myself in reality and fully confirm that was a dream and did not actually happen if i do not do this i tend to go back to sleep and just immediately have the same dream again some examples of what these non nightmares have been about washing my hands baking cookies doing push ups there is no catch or anything it is really just a dream about those simple activities that somehow registers as a horrible nightmare in my brain it is starting to take a real toll on my sleep has anyone had something like this happen before is there anything i can do to stop it i have not changed my diet or sleep schedule or anything like that lately so i do not know what might have started this trend 
360,death through meteorite,last night i had a dream about me and some people probably friends of mine buti do not know anymore watching the sky from a hill i noticed something that looked like comets flying through the sky and after some time thought that they looked like flames after some time a giant rock flew from the sky onto the city km away from us and a few seconds later the force from the impact hit us killing us imediatley in the few seconds i just thought that i do not want to die but was also somewhat excited about what might come after death there was no pain no nothing the dream did not end there i got reincarnated into the population after the meteorite hit earth there were not many people left the dream later put me back into an earlier part so that i could change fate i guess but it also ended soon after 
361,"dreamt i had a kid, and i'm kinda upset it's over",sorry if this formatting is weird i tend to have kinda mundane dreams just a lot of day to day stuff i have a lot of déjà rêvé déjà vu nothing major just little events i had a dream last night that i had a kid she was around maybe and the cutest little kid i have ever seen really dark curly hair and a lot of freckles and just the happiest face it was just a normal day we were packing up to go for a ride somewhere i think a beach but i do not remember and she was trying to negotiate with me about bringing some specific snacks she was funny kind of a smartass but i was when i was that age too it was all just such a bright nice dream that when i woke up i was upset that it was over i am too young at this point to actually realistically have kids but i dunno i miss her her name was daisy it is a little sad i guess but i am sorta holding out hope this is a déjà rêvé moment maybe it has some symbolic reason i do not know 
362,bro i just had a weird ass garfield dream,it plays out like a comic jon and garf are at a restaurant garf orders lasagna and jon orders a whole ass turkey and the passes out eating not garfield is in charge of the money and keeps buying jon turkeys while he s like laying dead on the table then like i guess they com back another day jon is like a dried out corpse and a bunch of people around them at the booth holding ads for turkeys 
363,been having dreams about ww3,so recently in the last few months i have had about three different dreams that all somehow end up with my surroundings and myself getting bombed i tend to be on the survivors side of the bombs one way or another even though some of the bombs are right on top of me the setting is always different once it was a haunted mansion another time it was current time in a city based on a real city i go to now and then then it was a sci fi world filled with game references and now most recently it was a steampunk y world might be irrelevant but wanted to mention the settings just in caseany kind of meaning i should be aware of behind these dreams 
364,"have you ever dreamed of being in love with someone you know, even if you’re not attracted to them in real life?",like dreaming you re dating a friend of yours even tho you ve never really had a crush on them and then you wake up like wow nice dream but why was it her of all people lol do you think it s totally random when this happens or that it s an indication you may secretly like that person 
365,"dreaming of being attacked, kidnapped, and escaping.",so i literally just woke up from a dream where i was at work taking out the trash when i was suddenly ambushed by two dogs i had my car running and i was ready to go after taking out the trash but the dogs jumped and bit me so hard i fell to the ground it is also fair to mention that i literally got off of work at like am so i am not sure if that has something to do with it after that a man was hiding in a small metal storage closet i was so angry in the dream that i grabbed a pen and started stabbing him in the face however when i did more people started coming out of nowhere and tried to attack me and they succeeded in holding me down now being held on the ground i saw another random man being attacked as well while taking out the trash and there were like kidnappers trying to get the both of us i am not sure how but i managed to fight them of like i was some sort of karate fighter which i am not i do not know how to fight at all i also kept stabbing these people in the eyes and at one point i took someones eye out of their socket which was so scary because i did not want to do it in the dream but i had to the feelings i experienced were being afraid angry but at the same time being compassionate because i did not want to hurt them i just wanted to go home after work they also taunted me a lot but i took advantage of that and managed to flee through a back door in the dream i managed to take control of what was happening which was weird because mostly my dreams consist of me being a spectator however in these dreams i was able to be in two places at once in a car driving away from the kidnappers and at the back entrance which led into a parking lot where the kidnappers apparently had guns now and were shooting at anything they saw eventually i was able to drive away and disguise myself with a hat and a mask which to me seems so stupid but i guess that worked in the dream however it does get blurry what happened but i killed one of the kidnappers in the dream with the help of another man we buried him in his front yard and covered the area with red plants and roses i am not sure how it happened but with the help of the man we killed a lot of the kidnappers looking back at it it did feel like a movie of some sorts but it felt so real i am just curious what it all means if it means anything at all i do not want to be attacked or assaulted while at work thank you in advance if you were this long ass paragraph 
366,i just had a nightmare of being a serial killer.,this is kind of fucked up for me i have been pretty indulged in gore content for many years because of morbid curiosity and somehow for some reason i feel a certain amount of my stress is relieved from watching it and sometimes when i am actually awake i think of doing acts of violence against other people it could be my family relatives friends or strangers just a few minutes ago i freaking woke up because i had a dream of being a serial killer i remember coming home feeling really angry for a reason i ca not remember so when i got home i just slowly went inside the premises i did not inform anyone that i was home and i just took the kitchen knife at first i slowly went to my parents room there i saw my dad laying down on his stomach looking at his phone and then i just suddenly slit his throat and then held his head then slit it again and again till he was beheaded and to my surprise i did not feel a fucking remorse when i did it and the next thing i did was i was planning who to murder next my mother or my uncle that is living with us and then i suddenly felt remorse i felt a feeling that this is not me i reminded myself that i am not a serial killer i reminded myself that i am a human being and when i realized i had committed murder i said to myself this must be a dream and i screamed and then i woke up then right now i am writing this post i hope i can get insights as to why i dreamt of being a serial killer in my dream it is my first time dreaming of this

368,strange patterns in my dreams.,growing up i used to dream very normal average dreams some crazy stuff would happen sometimes i d remember sometimes i wouldn t that was the end of it around my sophomore year of high school i had this dream that i went to milwaukee with my mom and was riding these rinky dink subway cars around and ever since then my dreams have been building this world now i remember everything everything there s so many hundreds of places in my dreams there s several cities that are what i view as interpretations of real life cities i have a life in my dreams it s like when i close my eyes in real life i open them in my dream life i have relationships in my dreams sometimes often i look forward to falling asleep because my dream world is so vivid and real i could go on for hours and hours in detail about my dreams one of the places i visit in my dreams the most is the bunker it s in this basement hallway of a building used in my dreams as an oversized group cabin that i ll end up goin to with large groups of people it s a big steel door with faded red paint and opening it leads down into this deep dark cement bunker i am the only one who knows about the bunker the absolute craziest thing i can remember was going to a restaurant i frequent in my dreams with the usual group of people there were people there that hadn t been there before and me and my group had to convince these people i d been there before in previous dreams no one i talk to has anything remotely like this i m hoping to find answers on here 
369,sleep paralysis?,is it sleep paralysis if i wake up from an intense dream and see shadow people that vaguely resemble my college friends open my door and enter my room i could still move and think i think but i was so out of it it was like i was still dreaming so i just went back to sleep i have never experienced smth like this before tho it was a really strange experience and comes the night before i leave college for this semester to go back home

371,i had a dream i died but it felt like it had something to do with quantum physics/ theory of quantum immortality,a few nights ago i had what felt like the most scariest experience in my entire life i woke up crying from how intense it felt in my dream i was driving alone in my car on a highway i ve driven on before at this point i become half conscious i m able to think but unable to control what is going on as i m driving i start to lose control of my car amp i remember thinking oh no why is this happening and i became incredibly scared because i m starting to drive into a group of people stranded on the side of the highway i remember hitting them amp clearly seeing a woman go flying after she hit my windshield after i hit the group of people i m full on looking at the wall of the highway i clearly remember the feeling and how terrified i was amp i had a quick thought about a the theory of quantum immortality to break it down and please correct me if i m wrong quantum theory is basically modern physics explaining the nature and behavior of matter and energy on the atomic and subatomic level the theory of quantum immortality quantum suicide is if you were to be put in a life or death situation and your consciousness is certain you won t die your consciousness your perspective wouldn t die this theory obviously has some arguments to disprove but it s just a theory now back to the dream as i m staring at the wall i confidently thought i won t die i won t die and i hit the wall as i go forward i begin walking and the setting changes to my moms house i was scared and frantically looking for her so she could comfort me from what felt like a near death experience i walk in the backyard amp see a friend of mine in a hard hat with a crew doing construction i was relived to see a familiar face amp asked where my mom was and he was smiling and just said she was at my aunts as i walked inside from my moms backyard i was immediately inside my aunts house and it looked like a family party was going on i finally found my mom and she was with my sister they were smiling and happy to see me and i began crying and hyperventilating and yelling i almost died i almost died and they gave me a very odd look and i turned away from them and woke up it sounds like a long dream but it all felt very fast the feeling was so intense like i said i woke up crying lol i m a firm believer in dreams have meanings but i m not too sure what this means if someone knows anything

373,meaning of a series of bad dreams?,i have been having bad dreams not nightmares but just genuinely bad dreams last night i had a series of dreams that left me speechless the first part of my dream started off in a batcave like lair i was being hunted by enhanced individuals for a reason unknown to me i do not remember much of it because of what followed the next thing i know i am in my hometown but it is not my hometown it was so familiar yet so foreign i was at a house party and all of a sudden houses across the street blew up in flames i remember the terror and screaming of everyone there i started driving then i ended up in a parking garage i came face to face with the guy who blew up the houses but he did not see me i did not know him tall man brown hair driving a blue suv i was able to get awayi got into my car and started driving but did not know where i was going i ended up in the mall getting ice cream but i did not have shoes on my sister was with me after the ice cream i drove us home but as i was driving i was going too fast around a bend on the highway going really fast i ended up going off the road and hit a bunch of trees then i woke up after not sleeping after that i finally fell back asleep this time i just spawned on a beach with my cousin but it was so beach i have ever been to i could feel the heat of the sun of my skin and the sand on my feet i went on the boardwalk alone to get sunscreen and other things because i did not have anything with me i just appeared there after aimlessly walking the boardwalk alone with no luck of finding sunscreen i enter a mall of shops on the boardwalk this time an active shooter appeared and started chasing me even though i was not the target the same man who blew up the houses i eventually got away and met with my cousin where we got pizza then i woke up i am so confused why i had all these bad dreams in one night it was absolutely terrifying that every dream had a bad outcome has anyone had dreams like this what do they mean my biggest concerns are the being hunted down the explosive fires with screams the lethal car crash and being chased by an active shooter
374,mile stone,as of today i have written down more dreams this year than i did for all of last year and more than i wrote the year before i have a total of dreams i have written down over the last years granted i was only keeping track of my most interesting dreams my goal for this year is to at least double that but preferably write down dreams half of one year by the end of the year i know i am capable of the dreaming part but putting in the writing is the hard part wish me luck 
375,weird experiences lucid dreaming?,so this is my boyfriend is experience but i am so fascinated by it so i had to share when he was younger maybe middle school age he would have nightmares often and learned how it get out of them by lucid dreaming he did not even know what that was at the time but instead of waking himself up he had complete control over his dream he said he would literally wipe the dream so that everything is just white and blank and create whatever he wanted to dream about and he did this pretty often however at some point if he was adding and changing too much stuff an old man would come up to him and tell him that is enough and he is reached his limit after that he could not change the dreams at all and if he woke up and fell back asleep he could not lucid dream in the same night this man came often and it was the same man every time has anyone experienced anything similar 
376,terrible dream i just need to get it off my chest,not sure if this is where the dream started or not but i woke up from a coma and had had a bad accident i was physically ok but i do not know what happened exactly and it was very traumatic i was in a coma for only days but i learned upon waking that my dad had died in this dream my parents had never divorced and i think i was closer with my dad although we are pretty close in real life still my mom said he was so upset by my incident and he believed that i was not going to live that he crashed his car into something and we were not sure if it was an accident or not i did not process this very well and a few days later went to some kind of party for my boyfriend is friend i ended up having to leave early and drove home alone and a song came on that was so heartbreaking i ca not even explain how hurt i felt listening to that song and everything with my dad hot me while i was driving i was sobbing until i ended up in this big dark pool i had been there with my dad as a child and i was watching myself as a child trying to jump in while my dad encouraged me from below i knew that i had to step into myself and experience this moment again but i was not sure of i was ready eventually i gathered the courage and i became young me i was scared to jump in the pool but i did it and when i went into the water i saw a door at the bottom i opened it and i ca not remember what was behind the door but i was crying when i came back out i did it over and over again and there was something different behind the door each time but i ca not remember what and i was crying more and more the more i went in finally i left the door and i was sobbing harder than i ever have in real life but i was under water and could not breathe so i came to the top and that is when i woke up very rough dream 
377,weird dream about fiancé and grandma,background i was raised by my grandma and she has always been very important to me unfortunately she passed right before i graduated high school so she never got to meet my fiancé jeff for the dream summary i met jeff in college we ve been together years and are getting married next year he s amazing and i love him when i was i met my childhood friend carl carl was a year or two older than me but we played together up until i moved when i was my grandma did know him and i think she sometimes wondered if we d be together i still talk to carl occasionally like twice a year and that s it but we were never involved and never dated he still misses my grandma too dream summary so i had a dream my grandma was watching me and my cousins but instead my parents house or my uncles house we were in a bigger version of my college apartment someone comes to the door and everyone greets the person and calls them carl even though when i looked at them it was clearly jeff they do have similar hair and a similar build but it was clearly jeff s face we all went for a walk and carl jeff told me he liked me when we got back we go into my bedroom and he tries to kiss me but i stopped him and say i m getting married i can t he says he understands and stays by me for the rest of the dream but in my head i was confused because i couldn t remember who i was getting married to in my dream i could remember an ex and this friend carl but i couldn t remember that i was marrying jeff i brush it off in the dream without saying anything and i ask my grandma if she ever used cloth diapers for her kids in real life i was researching cloth diapers for babies a few days ago out of curiosity she told me to ask my aunt i was wondering what this might mean i m hoping it s my grandma saying she likes jeff and my brain was using carl because my grandma was never around jeff 
378,a cross over of human dreamers?,i ve had two dreams over the past year seemingly normal but jarring in each one i d suddenly come across another person we d lock eyes and it was like we both looked at each other in shock you re not meant to be here the first time i was roaming my local park and it was a homeless man the second time very weird was a naked man in my shower it honestly felt like they were another person like a dream roamer is that a thing they both mad me feel fear or awe and it would wake me up

380,hyper realistic dream of killing a large snake and then a large orb-weaver spider that could jump.,the snake wasn t a real snake it was closest to a rat snake but a lot thicker and more aggressive the spider was a fist sized yellow orb weaver i have a really bad fear of spiders i ended up killing the snake after wrestling around with it and a little later the spider showed up it kept trying to jump on me but after a few failed attempts i killed it as well from my understanding killing a snake can signify triumph over something stressful or beating an addiction i m coming up on a year of sobriety but it hasn t been much of a struggle to be frank i had a problem a few months ago where a friend showed their true colors and proved they were anything but a friend it s been itching my mind here and there but i m finally able to get past it so i think that might be what s behind me killing the snake but i don t know what the spider could ve been about any ideas

383,wen zombies attack, ok reddit do you remember this movie called slumberland that s on netflix well i ve recently noticed that my dreams are kind of like what they go through running through different genres of dreams and being changed by nightmares my dreams have been like that depending on how much i remember that morning i can remember from to different sections of my dreams the dream i had tonight had about to different sections i ca not remember too much about wat happened first but this is what i can remember it first starts with my mom waking me up we were in the cabinet next to a river and i was helping our cat and also the lizard i think it was trying to help them my whole family was there in the cabin and we were getting some really old mattresses out and they wore really ancient mattress that you do not want to be sleeping on but after that we had some books that we were going to go donate to a lady i want to donate them to her but she took one and runed away so i went caught up with her where she was in a really shallow end of the library and i was giving the book back to her and she said she was going to come back for the other one because she can only do one at a time so we took the other one and put it away and then when i went back out but i was in a different area i was in another person s driveway his car was even there and he had a little kid that had no hands and was a toy he buried the kid into the ground and replaced its head with a pumpkin and the small child would carve the pumpkin into a really cute looking pumpkin head the guy would continue to do this to the small child then i ran to the house and fell into the sewers i think well swimming through it i found parts of bodies zombies infected i found this one girl who was pregnant she was a chinese cultured lady she was tied up and drowning with things that were trying to get into her private areas i freed her and she went on her merry way and left i went back up and out of the sewers i then found myself in the center of an operation in ncis where special agent gibbs was directing the team they were doing something but i think they were trying to stop the zombie apocalypse which they failed because the zombies got into their operation started eating them special agent gibbs got the worst of it sadly i ran out of there were the small child toy was laughing at us they still had a carved pumpkin for their head when i ran out i found myself at a very large building with a big statue in front of it and the statue was of a little lolly girl big pigtails blue dress and i think she would ve had a leak in her hand but she didn t i was a different little lolly with also pigtails more like space buns with a pink dress and a water gun we kind of played like splatoon on the area until the shops opened up i was suddenly helping the shopkeepers keep their shop in order they even ask me to do time set day to make sure the zombies won t get in i constantly made them check their sewers and stuff to make sure that zombie parts won t come up eventually i found some cosplayers cosplaying scooby doo characters i went and joined them because i was also dressed up like fred and i found another guy that was dressed up like fred i was like hey fred how you doing i wanted to hang with him for a while and then daphne came over and sat in between us and i was like what s the big deal here i m trying to hang out with fred and they took it the wrong way they ware thinking i was trying to go on a date with him which is wrong i did not want to go on a date with him i just wanted to hang out with him and then he made a rude comment saying fred and velma are siblings which is wrong they re not siblings and then i was in a cosplay outfit of velma now then there was a scream and a commotion someone got bit by a zombie everyone started panicking and running around zombie tried to come after me and fred we fled to the neighboring shop which was like beardos and pizza i think and they made pastries pizza we went in there and tried to hide from the zombies and for some reason the zombies were only trying to come after us also sidenote on the zombies they weren t like minecraft zombies they were like zombieland zombies from like the live action movies stuff they were realistic both me and fred and the zombies made pizzas and pastries on our way out i suddenly was scooby doo i ran into a cabinet well fred ran out the door and i was trying to do like a makeup tutorial thingy like i was trying to suddenly become look like something else i made a picture that was my face and then painted over it and the zombie got distracted by it for some reason i ran out side and then ran back inside ware it was gone i went back and made myself another pastry because those things were delicious but i was poor and didn t have any money so then someone tried ordering some french toast and the baker asked what kind of dow with that and they couldn t remember but it was a water resistant dow and for some reason i knew that i told them and they were like oh yeah it s only i was helping them or something i don t know that s when i woke up from the dream and darn zombies always chasing me

395,terrifying dream loop?,just finally woke up from the worst nap i have ever had i was stuck in a loop of either waking up in sleep paralysis or waking up into another dream nearly identical to the previous one the dream was me waking up in my bed in my room indistinguishable from my real one and there would always be a corpse of someone i know laying next to me always a different one the worst part is i was aware that i am dreaming because i automatically do the nose breathing technique but i couldnt figure out how to wake up and when i did it was into a second paralysis after which i fell asleep again it felt like actual days passed even though i was only asleep for an hour amp im kind of scared to go to bed tonight how do i prevent this amp edit also remembered to add this detail since waking up i have had a noticable visual snow over my vision
396,lucid dreams and recurring person,hello dear community i am posting here because i wanted to share something odd that have been happening lately i started to lucid dream for the past year i use to do it in the past but not as often a couple months ago i had a terrible nightmare and in the middle of it i saw a famous actor and because i recognize him i realize that i was dreaming i was stuck in a non stop loop of false awakening and he helped me wake up for real since then this actor have become my cue to know that i am dreaming each time i am having a dream that is really realistic i will call his name to see if he appears once he appears i have full control of my dream sometimes he ll stay by my side or he will just acknowledge that i am dreaming and everything is ok it happened at least a dozen time in the past months i feel weird because i work with actors all the time and i do not put people on a pedestal also i have never met that person in real life also this person is always courteous and helpful in my dream in one dream i asked him why he was there why it was this particular appearance all the time he said he did not know and was as confused as me it is kind of neat that i have found a way to trigger my lucid dream but i feel a bit odd to have this person in my dream more often than say my husband 
397,"two things, this sub should be exclusively for nightmares, because people's dreams are boring, and here's last night's nightmare...ranking in the top 3 for sure.",okay so this dream does not sound too scary and it is not very long but you need to try extremely hard to put yourself in this position because it was one of those dreams where there is absolutely no doubt in your mind that what you are experiencing is real so i am going to explain this as if it really happened since that is how the experience happened so i am on a boat with my older brother in the middle of the night he says something like be quiet we are not supposed to be here i said something like okay then we hear something coming out of the water i ca not see what it is other than the fact that it was absolutely massive a leviathan of some kind black and seemingly square shaped it keeps coming out of the water then it keeps coming out of the water again this is all real to you in the moment so imagine the absolute fucking terror seeing this thing come out of the water finally after what seemed like forever this thing is out of the water and floating above us maybe feet all i felt was my pounding heart and pure incomprehensible terror as i watched this mystery box fly over our tiny boat in the dead of night this never happened before but in my dream i literally fainted which in turn woke me up unfortunately the dream ends there so i did not learn anything i still feel extremely unsettled thinking about it i know it was just a dream but i still want to know what that was in my dream my mind was thinking government aliens government aliens

407,the wandering monks,i just woke up from a dream involving an order of monks who spend their entire lives not in a cloister but on a never ending pilgrimage they constantly walk in lines on exactly determined paths across the land never breaking pace or marching order but still they welcome outsiders to walk with them they all had bald heads tan skin from being out under the sun so much getting progressively darker with age and wore grey tunics with orange togas on top making them appear outwardly similar to buddhist monks although the dream was set in a mountain town similar to one i knew from spain so i was marching in line with them together with another outsider he was one of those extreme outdoorsy globetrotter types a young white male late teens or early twenties with light brown dreadlocks in a ponytail sparse but wild facial hair ethno style necklace and bracelets a messy backpack t shirt cargo shorts and bare feet he did not seem to take the spiritual significance of the pilgrimage seriously and generally be the kind of guy who travels just for the experience of traveling he bragged to me how tough the monks routes were and that they had to collectively stop their pilgrimage on two occasions already because he could not keep up i was irritated by his attitude and asked if he should not be expected to rather die from exhaustion than interrupting what is sacred to them to that i got an unexpected response an elderly heavily tan monk who was apparently the only one behind us broke the marching order to walk past and then a circle around me you should ask the ritual master about things like this he then told me and moved on in front of me the ritual master was a woman the only one i noticed among the monks she was also the only one to wear pants dressed in all orange and to walk besides the line accompanied by a man dressed the same except in navy blue who served as her translator sadly i could not ask her anything before waking up but from the old monk is behavior towards me i got a feeling that he meant that my way of thinking was an obstacle although not the kind to simply avoid and walk past but that one needs to get around as part of the path 
408,seven swords,hello i have been dreaming about having different kinds of swords it is like i have collected them none of them had a scabbard here are the ones that i remember first one was a plastic sword yellow blade and pink hilt second one was another plastic sword blue blade and pink hilt third one was a short sword with a curved tip like the shape of an aries horn forth one was a katana with a long black blade with green waves painted on fifth one was a normal katana sixth one was the only one that had a scabbard looked like a katana the scabbard was simple but beautiful probably made of fine beechwood and the blade was white as bone seventh one was a long sword with a black hilt and a silver blade this one came to me in another dream with the other ones the third sixth and seventh one were the ones i had much joy wielding as i wielded the third and the sixth together shouting out of my lungs and running through the room and wielding the seventh one with admiration and pride i am personally very fond of swords there was a shadow sword in my childhood that made me overcome my fear of the dark but what could this all mean i ll be very thankful if someone could interpret it for me

411,"goatman, creepy girl, and religious youtube content",the dream started with me in my living room seeing a very tall creature in the hallway with the legs and the face of a goat but human torso and arms amp i was afraid of him at first but he seemed to just be walking back and forth in my house in a very robotic way especially in the hallway and he did not notice me so at that point i thought i was safe amp however as i turn left i saw a weird creature a short blonde girl dressed in light blue clothing however she had disproportionately big eyes and a huge creepy smile as soon as i saw her i instinctively thought only a higher power can save me from this i ca not beat that thing amp i started slowly walking backwards and she followed me i took my phone to look for a prayer or religious reading or anything else like that on youtube hoping that it would make the creature go away but my phone was slow to load eventually i found myself back to the wall desperately trying to load a video as she got closer and closer right before she reached me the dream ended

413,chronicles of my weirdass dreams 2: jungle gym politics,i only recently discovered this sub after a particularly intense dream over the weekend i have already posted that one if anyone is interested warning it is pretty fucked up and it is nice to finally find a place to share and talk about memorable dreams i am prone to experiencing especially vivid elaborate dreams and this is one of the earliest dreams i can remember in vivid detail i think i was when i had this dream and i must have been visiting ontario place that summer i am sure there is become a few confabulated spots here and there over the years since i dreamed this but i wrote a lot of it down a long time ago which helps if anyone would like to take a stab at analyzing the meaning of this and or the previous dream i posted by all means please do so i am at this theme park a lot like the old ontario place when my parents suddenly tell me it is time for me to go make a living on my own at the ripe old age of six i guess so i do what any child would do after being freshly abandoned by her family in the middle of a theme park i join a gang of kids living in its giant jungle gym it is one of those huge towering structures with elaborate tunnels slides bridges secret passageways hidden rooms and ball pits it somewhat resembles the ho generation station in ontario place at the time but much bigger and more elaborate this teenage boy named mickey ran the pack and the vast majority of other kids were also older than me so i was relegated to the task of patrolling for intruders from the jungle gym is top level using a big yellow telescope attached to the railing to look down near the entrance i did lots of asking who goes there to anyone attempting to reach the entrance if an approacher tried anything suspicious or tried to barge in i would yell over to the shooters on the other side of the top level to start firing balls taken from the ball pits down on the intruder using these big yellow ball shooting devices attached to the railings probably inspired by the atom blaster at ontario place kids even younger than me called the worker bees were the ones tasked with fetching balls down from the first floor ball pits and bringing them up to the shooters to load their ball shooters meanwhile the fastest kids in the pack were the fetchers who would run to pick up any balls outside before returning to the safety of the jungle gym as fast as possible i tried out to be a fetcher since being a fast runner was pretty much my entire personality at that age but for some reason i could hardly run at all during the test so i failed my closest friend and fellow patroller was a girl named daphne who even looked a bit like daphne from scooby doo with her red hair and purple clothing she was the one who brought me to mickey after my family abandoned me because she and i had previously played together in other areas of the theme park as patrollers we had fun using the telescope to try and make our voices deeper and boom more loudly to intimidate anyone approaching the jungle gym sometimes we played good cop bad cop with approachers who got testy with us daphne would play the trigger happy bad cop and i had play the more diplomatic good cop holding her back from calling the shooters sometimes we had banter back and forth with the shooters across the jungle gym during periods of no activity below i always wanted there to be activity though i found the work of patrolling very fun daphne and i reported directly to a teenage girl named nicole who was commander of the patrol she was also the girlfriend of mickey people called them mickey and nickey nicole was really nice to us and let us take bathroom breaks whenever we wanted there was somehow both a girls and boys bathroom inside of this jungle gym and sometimes she brought us lollipops if she had been visiting one of the candy stands in the theme park as the sun began to set and the park started closing down for the night nicole told me that our gang had been working on a secret project to secure the waterpark as part of our territory a group of kids from our gang led by mickey is right hand man named andrew had been out there fighting for the waterpark all day nicole told me that when anyone over there returned home we would all be called in for a meeting in the biggest room within the center of the jungle gym i went down to the bottom floor when i saw andrew and some other kids come through the entryway the beefy third grade boys who had been standing around the entryway all day seemed excited to see andrew these boys were known as the security they checked anyone entering in case someone was hiding scary weapons like balls from foreign ball pits or waterguns anyway the security started wishing andrew a happy birthday i tried to tell him happy birthday too but he just kind of glanced at me and did not say anything i tried again asking him how old he was turning but he ignored me and went with the security up the ladder i never got to find out how old andrew was which especially bummed me out for some reason but he was at least mickey and nicole is age daphne had seen me trying to be friendly so she told me no one says happy birthday to andrew because is he is mean the only reason security does is because he is commander of security everyone headed to the second floor room lined with dark blue foam mats and it was like an assembly mickey and each of the teenage commanders of different subgroups security patrollers shooters fetchers spies fighters worker bees etc stood at the front facing everyone else andrew revealed that the waterpark was now ours mickey announced that the gang had a new member and i had to awkwardly stand up as kids clapped for me then mickey recited the rules of the gang there is a good chance i have forgotten or mixed up some rules here these are definitely not verbatim lol no babies in the gang kids who still had parents to go home to at the end of the day were called babies regardless of age no babies in our territory when the park is closed we only let them into our territory during open hours after security checks to keep up the appearance that we are babies too so adults do not find out this is actually our home and try to kick us out of it no telling babies or adults about the gang the only adults who know about kids living in this theme park are the staff who used to live in the theme park themselves mickey is older sister heather is a member of the staff as well as the former leader of the jungle gym gang if you grow up and leave the theme park one day you must take the secret of the gang to your grave if you grow up and leave the theme park one day never forget where you came from this means never letting anything happen to us or the park mickey claimed hillary clinton was secretly a former jungle gym gang kid who was now running for president so the park could never be shut down lmao i guess this dream kinda predicted the future because after she lost ontario place closed down in always respect and obey your commander if you are a commander respect and obey your leader if you are the leader be worthy of respect and obedience no harming babies unless it is in self defense babies have nothing to do with our fights with other gangs no stealing stuff if you want something someone else has you fight them for it like a real member of this gang never harm or abandon anyone in the gang we are your family no traitors this means no breaking the rules leaving the gang or acting against the gang everyone around was chanting the last rule no traitors no traitors no traitors and pumping their fists in the air until the room abruptly started shaking then it became a panicked flurry of kids scrambling out of the room as someone shrieked that we are under attack made sense since we were all in the room with no one left to guard the place i ran up to the top floor to see what was going on dozens of kids wearing swimsuits trunks goggles and floaties were storming the entrance and trying to shake the legs of the jungle gym structure from below i saw none of the shooters were at their stations so i ran over to the other side of the jungle gym to get to one of the ball shooters and i started firing at the intruders these intruders were the gang of kids who lived in the waterpark and they wanted revenge on us for taking their territory eventually i ran out of ammo so i had to go down to the ball pits to get some more had to do a lot of sneaking around and hiding amid the frenzy downstairs one boy saw me and chased me with his watergun for a while but i eventually escaped with a bunch of balls and went back up to load the ball shooter after hitting some more of the waterpark kids i looked up toward the spot where i usually stood patrol and that is where i saw mickey and andrew mickey and andrew were talking but when mickey turned his back andrew ripped the big yellow telescope right off the railing it was attached to and started hitting mickey with it he started yelling at mickey about how unfair it was that mickey is sister heather chose mickey as her replacement to lead the gang even though andrew had been in the gang for longer ah mickey the original nepo baby mickey tried fighting back but lost his balance and andrew was able to shove him right off the side of the railing where mickey plummeted to the concrete floor below he was still alive but badly injured and would need to be taken by staff to a hospital where he would never get to come back andrew then realized i saw the whole thing and made his way straight over to me he said he remembered me because i was the only one besides security who said happy birthday to him not even mickey had wished him a happy birthday so he was willing to spare me as long as i agreed to say it was the waterpark kids who did what andrew did to mickey for some reason i had the audacity to push my luck and say what is in it for me no one is gonna believe you on your own everyone thinks you are mean he asked me what it was i wanted so i told andrew i wanted to run the waterpark since he ca not be two places at once and will need someone else running the waterpark now that he is the new leader andrew agreed to my request the waterpark kids were eventually chased out of the jungle gym then andrew announced his version of what happened to mickey to the rest of the gang back in the dark blue room nicole started crying someone in the group shouted why should we believe you so andrew pointed a finger at me and everyone turned their heads to look in my direction i quickly said yes i saw it too after that andrew told the gang that i was very brave in the fight against the waterpark kids responsible for pushing mickey from the railing so he was rewarding me by making me the new commander of the waterpark a bunch of the other teenagers in the gang got upset because this jungle gym gang has a very age based hierarchy and all of the older kids wanted that job andrew simply told them too bad excited to be the new commander of the waterpark i led a group from the gang over to the new territory to meet up with the others already there older kids even asked me on the way there if they could do anything for me like give me snacks so i was really loving the perks of this new title we met up with the older kids guarding the doors to the waterpark fronted by a guy named mike he asked which of us was commander of the waterpark so i said me and he looked down at me with this weirded out disgusted look on his face i ignored it though and went on to swing open the doors to the waterpark it had these huge multicolored slides a wavepool a sandbox and a giant tipping bucket on top of a water themed jungle gym armed with great big waterguns attached to the sides there was also a big cabinet full of floating tubes for going on the slides as well as waterguns i gathered all the older kids in the waterpark and daphne for some reason to the water themed jungle gym and decided to try to make them more content with me being commander of the waterpark by giving them their own titles this waterpark would need its own commander of security so i gave the job to mike who seemed a bit happier after i did that i realized that because this place was so far away from home the waterpark was gonna need some messengers to go back and forth between us and the main jungle gym that meant i needed a commander of messengers daphne really wanted it but i decided to give it to this older teenager named sophia and let daphne be just a messenger i gave out a bunch of other titles but the only important ones here are mike and sophia anyways mike and sophia started pissing me off they would undermine me by interrupting me and ignoring me every time i tried to speak at commander meetings in the waterpark sophia outright told me that i am not the boss of her andrew is if i asked a messenger besides daphne to deliver a message to the jungle gym they would not do it unless sophia told them to do it daphne told me it was because sophia told all the messengers not to listen to me since she was the real commander of the waterpark mike would call me stupid right to my face and if there is one surefire way to piss off a six year old it is calling them stupid mike and sophia also became boyfriend girlfriend so i knew they were definitely conspiring together against me i had had enough of this so i gave daphne a message from me to deliver to andrew telling him what mike and sophia were doing to my ire though daphne returned with a message from andrew that said the exact same thing he had told all those older kids earlier too bad then nicole unexpectedly showed up to the waterpark she asked if she could talk to me in private and i agreed nicole then told me she discovered the truth about what andrew did to mickey to which andrew responded by declaring her a traitor she did not seem at all angry with me despite the fact i had corroborated andrew is lie maybe she figured a six year old kid was not at fault for complying to a nearly grown man even if that six year old did gain clout from it nicole explained that she had to flee the main jungle gym and members of our gang were on the hunt for her now at any minute messengers from the jungle gym could arrive here and tell everyone in the waterpark she was a traitor and that was exactly what happened next i heard mike start to shout guys nicole is a traitor nicole is a traitor and the sound of footsteps growing louder toward us i decided to help nicole escape leading her out of the waterpark through a super convenient secret tunnel nicole thanked me before she left telling me she would not forget this then i heard a commotion from down below i looked to see daphne and a bunch of the other kids yelling that i was the real commander of the waterpark and that mike and sophia were just big bullies in the sandbox i noticed a sandcastle that had been kicked over by sophia which had made one of the younger kids presumably the sandcastle is creator start crying on the opposite side was mike sophia and the other messengers and security yelling that sophia was the real commander daphne confronted sophia marching up to her until she was a few inches away from where sophia stood in the sandbox then sophia kicked sand in daphne is face and an all out fight broke out everyone in the waterpark started swinging on each other and spraying each other with water guns some even threw sand and balls brought over from the main jungle gym is ballpits i tried to get down from the waterpark is jungle gym to intervene but that was when mike got in my way and quoted happily n ever by saying this operation is about to have a hostile takeover just call it a little power play he chased me around the jungle gym trying to grab me until i made it to one of the giant waterguns and blasted him in the face at point blank range it bought me a few extra seconds to try and make a break for it once again i am seriously struggling to run in this dream i quickly slid down a waterslide and kept running knowing he was still right on my tail i then pivoted and scrambled up a ladder to the top of the water themed jungle gym again hoping to tire him out from there i ran across a bridge and continued to run to the next bridge until i heard a loud oi behind me i turned around to see daphne and my other supporters had blocked the way between me and mike as he was in the middle of crossing the first bridge there was a pause i looked around the rest of the waterpark to see everyone else had given up fighting and sophia had been tied up and i think mike made the exact same realization at the same time because a look of fear crossed his face as the silence was broken by the group of kids yelling get him they chased him back to the ladder he had just climbed and he decided to try and jump instead of spending extra time using the ladder he lay on the floor with his foot in his hand yelping the remaining group dragged an angry tied up sophia next to where mike was lying on the ground then stood over the pair i made my way past the huddle and demanded to know why the two of them would try and betray our gang like that sophia yelled that i was not the real commander of the waterpark she was i said oh yeah and who made you commander andrew did she spat the group and i exchanged confused looks but then sophia explained that before we left for the waterpark andrew had pulled her aside and told her to act as the real commander because he could not leave the waterpark he fought so hard for in the hands of a newbie as young as me he only did that because he had to after we had arrived at the waterpark sophia secretly told mike what andrew had told her and that was when the two of them decided to try and take control of things i just wanted to do what was best for the waterpark said sophia mike said he was one of the people who fought for this waterpark and he also did not trust me to run it from the moment he laid eyes on me he said i probably did not even know how to do multiplication so i recited a bunch of multiplication facts just to stick it to him because that is a sick ownage right there i tell ya anyway i started going off on him for what he did earlier and said something about how it was like he was trying to kill me well actually yeah apparently andrew had also sent a message to mike telling him to fucking kill me probably figured i would not bite my tongue about the whole mickey thing for too much longer mike said he did not want to do it he never would have tried to if andrew had not commanded it and that he was so sorry everybody was shocked by mike is revelation even sophia now everyone in the waterpark knew for certain that andrew was a traitor and we needed to do something about it problem is we were outnumbered at least to there were not nearly as many of us in the waterpark as there were in the main jungle gym and if we tried sending a message andrew could possibly intercept it and harm the messenger i suggested we find nicole for help she had listen to us you would think someone on the run from her former gang who is literally hunting her down would be difficult to find but nope i led an expedition of a few people from the waterpark including mike to help guard us while i left sophia in charge of the remaining gang in the waterpark to test if she could actually be a good temporary commander of the waterpark it took about two seconds for our party to locate nicole she was aboard this big pirate ship attraction with a group of other kids manning a lineup of great big cannons they had pointed at us state your business nicole called out it took a painstaking while to get through to her that it was me but eventually she realized and made the other kids stand down and let us board the ship that is when nicole saw mike the two of them started arguing right away her threatening to blow him to smithereens for calling her a traitor him saying she was a traitor for finding a whole new pack of kids to lead on this ship her saying he is the one who tried to kill his own commander which she knows about now for some reason him telling her she never would have been any sort of commander if she had not been dating mickey more nepotism in the jungle gym gang her mocking the limp in his foot from falling on it earlier yeah it was a mess tea was spilt eventually i got them to stop arguing by yelling shut up which made them both gasp and look at me in silence we eventually came to an agreement to work together to storm the main jungle gym since we would have the combined numbers to stand a chance against the kids in the jungle gym if andrew made them attack us the plan was to capture andrew then make him confess to the whole gang the amalgamated group of us began walking back to the waterpark when we stopped to notice the star wars themed stage like the one in disneyland california in our path something was suspicious about the sudden movement we noticed from its shadows at this point it was nighttime and the stage lights were not on so we could not see very well but we were worried that perhaps someone was spying on us mike daphne and i walked forward to take a closer look while the others hung back we each split up as we ventured onto the stage that is when i saw a flash of movement next to me and an object thrown right at me think fast i caught the object right as the stage lights all suddenly turned on to reveal heather mickey is older sister on the stage she had a giant lightsaber in her hand and she turned it on to reveal a glowing red emanating from the handle up the object i had caught in my own hand also turned out to be a lightsaber though i had yet to turn it on mike and daphne backed away off the stage as heather appeared totally fixed on me i know what you did op she yelled at me op what is she talking about i heard daphne ask in the background there was murmuring from the rest of the onlookers too stand up and fight op heather yelled i scrambled to turn my lightsaber on and it glowed purple she did one of those lightsaber twirls you wanna be a leader so bad well now you get to battle one in the background there was still confused chatter from the others watching like an idiot i just had to ask what did i do heather charged me and started swinging her lightsaber so i panicked and raised my lightsaber to block her from slicing me with that thing as she kept swinging at me she started telling the story of how it was andrew who pushed mickey from the top of the jungle gym the onlookers gasped all i could do was try to keep up with heather is flurry of swings so i would not lose any limbs she carried on saying i knew what andrew did to her brother and that i lied about it more gasps from behind me as i blocked another swing heather slammed into me pushing me backwards heather is a grown woman as i was getting shoved backwards and trying to hold my ground heather started talking about the deal i made with andrew and how i let andrew get away with everything he did to heather is brother all because i wanted to lead the waterpark for myself from behind me everyone off the stage started making comments along the lines of how could you and you monster and come on guys we can do the plan without op anyway finally heather managed to knock the lightsaber out of my hand and make me fall backwards onto my back the top of my head just slightly off the side of the stage so that when i tilted my head back i could see the upside down image of my whole group leaving me behind when i tilted my head forward again heather was standing over me with a lightsaber pointed at my neck i started screaming that yes i did it i lied i am sorry she asked if i was really sorry at this point in the dream i was extremely upset and scared absolutely shitless i told her i really was sorry i did not know what to do when it happened my family had just left me and told to make a name for myself i did not know what was gonna happen to me next i did not know if the new leader would have still wanted me in the gang after i could not stop andrew from doing that to mickey and i was just thinking about how to find somewhere i belonged and make a name for myself like my parents wanted i was not thinking about poor mickey in the hospital i was sorry did she still want to kill me heather moved the lightsaber away from my neck and tapped it against her hand revealing it had been fake the entire time i remember feeling like an idiot for not realizing sooner i asked her if mickey was okay she said he is doing a bit better now but that he broke every bone in his body do not ask me how he survived that mickey is just built dif i also asked her if mickey was mad at me to which she said no he forgives me we sat on the stage and talked for a while then i noticed the sun was rising which meant the plan to take the main jungle gym back from andrew was already starting heather made me promise one thing before i left though after we were done capturing andrew and making him confess we would bring andrew to her i did not envy whatever andrew was in for from heather but i agreed to do it and left i got lost in the middle of the theme park trying to find the main jungle gym again which really spiked the hell out of my anxiety because apparently it had not already been spiked enough in this dream but eventually i found my way back and it was a warzone over there i had to run inside to dodge the shooters who were pelting almost every inch of the cement with balls but that left me with security to deal with still posted by the entryway they asked me whose side i was on so i quickly lied and said andrew is the four boys frowned and surrounded me with folded arms but then they started laughing and said they were kidding i could go inside they told me to try and find a watergun in there that was what the traitors had brought in i pretended to nod before going up the ladder it was chaos up there with water and balls and fists flying everywhere i narrowly dodged a bunch of balls thrown at me with serious velocity and i knew i would be seriously hurt if one of them hit me i made the snap decision to run for the girls bathroom and lock myself inside a stall while i pondered my next moves andrew was nowhere to be found and to be honest i was pretty terrified of running into him he was very big and very scary eventually i got the idea to startle everybody into stopping and listening to me i just needed that telescope on the top floor to make my voice boom the way it did when daphne and i messed around with it the thought of daphne made me sad because i knew she was mad at me now and things might never go back to the way they were before but i still amped myself up to get back out there and grab that telescope finally i emerged from the bathroom stall again and made a beeline for the top floor maybe if i just kept looking forward no one would see me on the way up i found the big yellow telescope on the floor where andrew had tossed it after using it to hit mickey i put my lips to the telescope and tried figuring out again how daphne and i managed to make it work the first time try number one nothing try number two again nothing all this noise was going to give away my location to someone soon try number three boom i started screaming into the telescope that i was op and that i saw andrew push mickey off the railing he blamed it on the waterpark kids and i went along with his lies and i am sorry andrew is a traitor we all need to stop him a quiet fell over the jungle gym save for a few stray sounds of kids saying what just when i thought i had done it i had saved the day and everything was gonna be okay now i put the telescope down to see andrew standing in front of me you are so dead before he could move i turned around and bolted into the gigantic twirly slide that took me all the way down to the bottom and out of the jungle gym entirely i knew from the booming and thudding sounds just above me in the slide that he was chasing after me panicked i started running across the theme park screaming for somebody anybody to please help me the park was still closed but maybe there were staffers around hell maybe if i got lucky heather would hear me and come to my aid i knew how much she had been waiting to see andrew again no response i had to keep running for my life every time i thought i had lost him he had jumpscare the shit out of me and nearly snatch me at one point i heard him say he had nothing to lose now so there was nothing stopping him from killing me anymore that is not at all terrifying for a six year old to hear as i kept running i finally saw the waterpark and decided to run inside i ran up into the water themed jungle gym and hid inside one of the slides periodically craning my neck to see any sign of andrew things were quiet but occasional shadows flickered above and around the orange tube slide i was holding myself in the middle of suddenly an arm shot up from below and tried to grab my foot i climbed back up the slide to see him right by the slide and making a dash for the ladder to get to the platform i was on once again i found myself running across the bridge and the second bridge and when i got to the third bridge something seemed wrong i looked back and he was not there i started freaking out and looking in every direction to try and spot him something felt very very wrong that is when he darted out from his hiding spot on the ground behind part of a nearby structure and that was when i realized he was tall enough to grab me right off the bridge from where he was on the ground i had to jump off the side of the bridge it was one of those swinging bridges to avoid him and the only immediate place i could go from there that would not mean certain death was straight into the wavepool i ran straight in hoping andrew could not swim but of course he could swim now i had to figure out a way to get out of here i was swimming deeper and deeper into the wavepool but eventually i was going to hit a dead end there was no way in hell i had be able to get up the ladders on either side of the deep end fast enough for him not to pull me back down into the water i tried swimming toward one side of the wavepool leading him in that direction to make him think i was headed for the ladder then when i neared the ladder i ducked my head down beneath the water and pushed myself off the side wall of the pool with my legs then i quickly pivoted toward the direction of the shallow end thinking my plan of escape had worked that is when i felt hands grabbing me trying to force me to stay beneath the water you know because i had not already been terrified enough times in this dream jesus fucking christ somehow or other though i managed to wrestle myself free and keep swimming until i made it out of the pool that was when i started hearing bells ringing from atop the jungle gym tower i knew what that meant i ran for the jungle gym tower once again stopping just beneath the structure andrew gave me a smug smile as he got out of the wavepool and walked over probably thinking i had given up from exhaustion and to think this was gonna be my best birthday ever sighed andrew then we both heard a ferocious rumbling from above i shot him a smug smile of my own too bad that is when the giant tipping bucket above the tower unleashed its full load of water straight down onto andrew pummelling him to the ground other waterpark people like mike sophia and daphne had just gotten back from the main jungle gym to see the colossal dunk so forceful that andrew could not even get back up while it was still going they immediately ran over grabbing and restraining andrew once the water was done pounding down from its bucket on top of the tower say it say it they screamed at him over and over again at this point andrew just seemed completely over everything so he rolled his eyes and asked if i confessed would you idiots stop being so annoying needless to say we got every confession we needed out of him and we brought him back to the main jungle gym to confess again for the whole gang to hear after that we decided to keep him prisoner in one of the boys bathroom stalls until it was time to deal with him again ironically he was guarded by the same third grade security boys he once commanded because andrew was now considered a traitor any positions he gave out were no longer valid including mine as commander of the waterpark but i knew just the candidate to recommend nicole is pirate ship kids became the newest members of our gang after fighting so bravely to free us from andrew is tyranny nicole became commander of the pirate ship the gang is latest and greatest territory in its expansion sophia became the new commander of the waterpark her title now officially official mike took andrew is old spot as commander of security in the main jungle gym daphne got promoted from former patroller to commander of the patrol i went back to being just a plain old patroller and i was a okay with that this is when for some reason i briefly switched povs in this dream over to andrew still locked in the bathroom sorry i know i promised to bring him to you but i guess this is the next best thing i as andrew heard from the other side of the door did security really have to make such a big fuss about this thing well they ll get used to it at least until things settle down a bit and we can properly pick a new leader thanks again for coming back by the way the pleasure is all mine he is just in there i can get the door for you oh no allow me i saw the first sliver of light i had seen since being locked up and it was almost immediately eclipsed by the figure of someone i knew very well she stood before me and lit the room up red with the flash of her lightsaber as the woman i had worked with for years slowly gave me an unhinged smile hello andrew the pov shifts back over to me standing just outside the bathroom door i heard andrew is muffled yelling and screaming from inside the bathroom finding it pretty funny then i went back to the top floor to meet up with daphne on patrol i remember feeling a bit apprehensive because we had not exactly spoke since the revelation about me going along with andrew is lie i tried breaking the tension by asking if she had get me a lollipop today and thankfully she laughed so i knew things were at least semi cool again the theme park finally opened and i went back to my usual duties of barking who goes there at babies and joking around with daphne and the shooters i got to handle one big gaggle of approaching kids who were not taking no for an answer but after that things got pretty dry pretty quickly i spent the last bit of my dream just itching for new approachers before i woke up thoroughly confused and disappointed that none of this had been real 
414,i had a dream that terrified me and i’m struggling to know what to do.,so at first i didn t know it was a dream because it seemed so real i was dreaming of laying down in my room in the dark so i stood up and even though my room was dark enough it got even darker and something told me to get out of my room i see my sisters door opened with her light on since her room is across from mine and i run in her room i turn around and see this flash of light where there is a man in my dark room with a huge grey face with bulging eyes looking straight at me smiling his face and eyes were so big he wouldn t look away my room was pitch black then he slightly turned his head still locking eyes with me and smirked at me like he was up to something it scared the shit of out me it s so weird because there s been times where i ve felt like someone was watching me but i wouldn t dwell on it now i no longer sleep in there and i m paranoid at home could there be a meaning behind seeing this man idk i ve had plenty bad dreams but to actually see someone face to face scared the living shit out of me 
415,had a dream about being a serial killer and getting locked up in a psych ward.,so i do not think whoever i was was ever named in the dream but his main thing was that he made tons of masks for himself each and every one was unique but when he was caught most of them were burned the psych ward was not particularly bad boring but not bad the people there were nice and the doctors tried to help a bunch of very dedicated fans kept trying to break me out some using force some trying to be subtle but each time they failed eventually i made friends with a security guard there but he eventually got shot by one of those fans only living long enough to take them out in response the last thing i remember of the dream is somehow finding my final remaining mask somewhere in the ward freaking out about it and eventually burning it something about burning it helped me move on and begin to recover i was congratulated by the staff i felt good about myself and it was finally time to leave it all behind me then i woke up 
416,dreams lasting days or weeks. please help.,as i said in the title lately i have been way too mentally exhausted to function throughout the day because my dreams last so so long like i am talking days or weeks here and i wake up totally out if it thinking that a week has passed in real life it is not quite lucid since i am not aware i am dreaming but i have control over my environment to a degree i wake up having forgotten my real life schedules and appointments and instead only remember the ones i had in my dream world and it is screwing me over badly any advice is appreciated and preemptive thanks 
417,had a very strange lucid dream,i fell asleep while doing the mild technique yesterday and then i dreamed that i was in my bed and fell asleep in the dream and then i had another dream about playing minecraft but suddenly the dream stopped and another dream formed but was a false awakening in the dream i woke up at am and then boom i suddenly did a reality check i pinched my nose and tried to breath and i could breathe but the dream started to blurr my house is living room had some weird chinese characters on the walls i stabilized the dream in three different ways but noone worked and then i close my eyes and i start hearing a loud buzz on my left ear and i saw weird things like i was having hypnagogia and doing wild and i started thinking about dogs pixar style about to touch noses dont ask me why and when they touched noses i woke up directly on a dream still aware i was dreaming but this time the dream was not so blurry but i was afraid because my room was so dark in the dream and then i close my eyes and woke up this time for real at am did i lost an opportunity i think so one last thing i woke up with temporary blindness on my left eye can someone explain why this happened 
418,i had the worst nightmare of my life,it all started with my looking at the turned around figure of my grandmother who for background i saw as a mother until she died when i was and i started to realize just how manipulative irrational she was i called out to her and when she turned around she had no eyes just caves into her face where her eyes should be though the dream was in first person i felt myself pout visibly as if this was normal and i held my arms out to hug her she stood i said hug she frantically pulled me into a hug trying to make out where i was with her hands and we began to recite a poem about the stars it said something about looking up at the stars no matter how far away the other person is she looked at me with that same face of accusation she used to and though i couldn t see it in her eyes when she said but it s all dark it s dark where i am my name i knew she was accusing me it was my fault she couldn t see just like it was my fault that she couldn t move back to her own home because she needed to take care of me as she hugged me her now honey deteriorating arms slowly got wrapped around my waist reminding me of what i did to her then i woke up only now i realize reading it doesn t nearly do it justice i may have forgotten something but i m fairly confident i remember it since i just woke up

420,i had a dream about a kid who was bullying other kids,i saw a kid around beat up other kids i wondered why he did not fear my presence so i went to separate them on trying to get hold of him i realized he was so strong that i took a step back my energy could not match his yet he was just a kid he wanted to fight me too i then woke up what is the meaning of this dream

424,a new way of contacting extraterrestrials,i just had a dream in which scientist presented their new strategy for building contact with potential extraterrestrials basically there are chemicals that despite being relatively easy for us to create do not really appear in the universe on their own thus if one were to find those in space they would probably be curios about its origin therefore if we were to send a lot of cosmically speaking rare materials into space we could maybe catch the attention of those who pass it and maybe they ll investigate where it came from in my dream the material they chose to send was sesame oil i love that idea it seems reasonable enough and if you chose the right materials s you could even be able to hide encode some kind of message like the time that the material took to reach them our cosmic coordinates or even the human genome and sure we already are doing basically the same thing using stuff like radio waves but those are not physical proof and those get weaker and less accurate over enough distance what do you think 
425,interpretation request on being murdered by a german shapeshifter,i had a dream last night where i was traveling around germany or norway or something for some reason and i kept seeing this woman in really ominous places like in caves or on top of buildings or in alleyways but i could never see her face until eventually i was riding a train and i ordered a glass of champagne but it was poisoned and i became paralyzed and i looked up to see it was her who had served me but i still could not see her face until her arms suddenly grew really long and skinny and her nails turned into claws and she turned me over onto my stomach and i could feel her rip out my spine and organs through my lower back and then i woke up any idea what this might mean 
426,dreamed an angel tried to murder me???,i had a dream last night that i floated up to the ceiling that happens sometimes and i am always scared the door will open or a window will open cause then i ll float outside but i am not flying cause i have no control the door opened and i was pulled outside then i realized it felt like someone was pulling on me but i could not see then i was dragged up into the sky and saw that it showed itself and it was an angel but not a good one they had the full intention of killing me then they dropped me and i screamed and then i was caught by my guardian angel and lowered gently to the ground where i puked and screamed and cried they left me there put like a protective force field over me to protect me and then went after the bad angel that tried to kill me what on earth am i supposed to think about this what could it possibly mean it was just so wild like why 
427,"i had the most terrifying vivid nightmare about having an episode of psychosis,, does anyone know what this could mean (sorry its long)",it started with me waking up from the nap i was taking and it felt so real because i remember dreaming about a movie that was a crossover between nightmare before christmas charlie brown spongebob and coraline and i woke up in my dream being that haha thats not a movie laugh out loud and then my mom came into my room and she was talking to me but it was so hard for me to listen to her and then my grandma came in and started talking at the same time as my mom about a different subject and then the lights were too bright and there were so many voices and i started screaming telling everyone to shut up because it was too much until my mom touched my back and asked me wtf was wrong and suddenly all of the voices were gone and my grandma was not there and all my mom was asking was what i wanted to have for dinner then she left my room and i suddenly had this super anxious feeling and in my mind i was thinking i was late for some sort or audition and i was sweating trying to figure out wtf to wear and bring and i finally got in my car and as i was driving it just felt like my car kept getting smaller and smaller but i finally got to the audition and it was in this small town that kinda looked like dt frederick and when i walked in i could not understand anything again so i left crying and when i went out to my car there was this guy who was like banging on my windows and i yelled at him to stop and he got into the car in front of mine but that car had been backed up into the front of mine so when he started driving it dragged my car with his and i was running after him yelling at him to stop while this group of dancers from the audition were hysterically laughing at me and then the guy slammed my car into a tree and drove off and i was freaking the fuck out and crying and i covered my eyes but when i uncovered them my car was literally gone and so were the girls and so thats when i started to be like im hallucinating andi do not know wtf is real and whats not and so i called my boyfriend and told him what was happening and he drove to me and was sitting on a bench with me trying to calm me down but then suddenly he started saying things like if you dont blank you are gonna die rn or just like things that literally sounded like my ocd personfied and then he started speaking in a way i could not understand and he was holding me too tight and then suddenly he was gone and i was sitting crying on the ground and i realized i wasnt even in the little town i was in some random parking lot and i didnt have my car with me and i didnt know where i was or what was real and then i finally woke up
428,"reoccurring dream where i get run constantly, almost always ending in getting caught and shot in the head",this has been an ongoing thing for me for a few years now the setting is always different the most recent one seemed like an office this time around there was a huge guy who and i cannot recall why but this guy angry and was going to kill me i remember trying to punch him but that seemed to not achieve anything i then tripped him and tried to stomp on his head which again doesn t achieve anything i begin to run and run until i reach a bathroom in which i hide and lift my feet above the ground he eventually found me and i saw the man holding a gun right after that is when i woke up another very similar dream was i was running away from another man but this time in a factory lots of pipes laid around and such i kept running and jumping through everything until i eventually reached a room once the man also wielding a gun reached me he put his head right next to mine and a gun to his own temple he pulled the trigger killed himself then once the bullet gets to me it flattened much like when you see a bullet hit something hard enough that it can t go through after that i woke up there are many other dreams like these that i have most of the time i don t dream daily pot smoker i do not know if it makes you not dream or not remember the dream but whenever i do dream it s almost always along with this theme now i don t necessarily hate these dreams in fact i kind of enjoy these dreams sure i m scared in the moment but it s also a thrill i m curious as to what people the people of r dreams think not at all trying to get a free therapy session out of this edit spelling and grammar

430,dreaming of someone i never think about,so last night i had an odd dream i dreamed about a guy i somewhat knew back in high school i talked to him a handful of times and i guess i crushed on him but unfortunately he ended up drowning years later after we graduated fast forward years i totally forgot all about him for the past year or two and all of a sudden i randomly had a dream with him in it all i remember was thinking if i got him to come with me he wouldn t pass away like he was supposed to i m just wondering what makes you dream of someone you literally forgot all about 
431,"you know me, don't you?",someone is been saying some oddly specific things in oddly specific places lately have you ever had a dream where you met someone you did not know trick question obviously when one of them would not rest until they saw you again did you take them someplace special did you show them things they ca not forget do you think they remember you when they are awake do you think they remember your smile pained though it sometimes is painted on in a calming show of compassion do you think they remember you hiding them from something too frightening to look at and telling them to close their eyes are you aware they have suspected you of stalking their accounts for at least a little while some things have hit too close to home for it to be coincidence even to someone who believes occam is razor maybe it is time time to stop dodging with throwaway accounts and leaving hints enticing though they may be i ll be waiting a molecular telepresence
432,crystals in my dreams,so iv stated before i am good at clarvoient dreams and seeing things happen sometimes years before they do and being able to control my dreams but lately iv had a lot going on in my life and stoped dreaming iv got into crystals and herbs and incents but lastnight i had a dream after burning imcents of jasmin and lavender and dreamed of a table with symbols and lots of crystals and i just wondered has anyone else seen weird crystals in their dreams and what it means
433,this has become a serious problem for the past few months and i need help,i wanna say since november i have been having dreams almost every single nightnormally i would not dream this frequently but i am freaking the fuck out about how it is becoming such a consistent reoccurring thing especially my last dream most of the dreams i do not remember but the ones that i do are usually nightmares now i agree that what happens in our waking life affects us still as we sleep and most of the time your dreams can be solved interpreted as just connecting the dots but guys i am tired of this i feel like i am on nightmare on elm street where i fear going to sleep and dreaming it is driving me insane i do not know what to do it is a blessing that once in a great while i will have blissful uninterrupted sleep where it is just darkness and i am able to feel more refresh any remedies or tips you guys have done to get rid of dreaming at least for a while 
434,i have the ability to run really fast in all of my recent dreams,i don t know if it s got to do with sports or anything but it somehow made me run x faster in my dreams does anyone else have this 
435,how can i stop dreaming so much?,i feel like i haven t slept in about a year every single night i will have intense vivid dreams filled with lots of talking thinking and decision making that feels very taxing i always wake up tired after a full nights sleep and no matter what point in the night i wake up i will have just been dreaming i ll often start dreaming the second i fall asleep usually upon waking up i ll have a period of random words nonsensical sentences and images flashing in my head it s driving me mad has anyone experienced anything similar any tips on how to curb it 
436,stressful dream and i wake up in sweats,context i m a first year teacher and the new semester started last weeki just woke up from this very vivid dream where i had a class of kids and i knew nothing all i knew regarding my subject was gone my heart is still pounding any idea what this means 
437,what does a mechanical grim reaper in a city at night mean?,i know it is not an original visual but i saw this in a dream recently and i am considering using it as the basis of a story so i am curious about what potential symbolism it could possess 
438,does anyone deal with this?,i don t know how common it is but sometimes before i go to sleep and after waking up i ll hallucinate briefly it s like i m still dreaming for a bit i ve dealt with it enough that it s not that creepy first time it happened i was at my friends house and woke up and looked at the white ceiling and crazy complex shapes just cycled through my vision for like seconds the second time i saw a bread truck in my friends driveway i just went back to sleep after that one most of the other times it s been giant insects but i have read things wrong too for like seconds i think these experiences had to do with stress at the time but it seemed like the remains of dreams this hasn t happened in a while but i guess i m just curious if anyone else had something like this happen before hope this is like the right place to post this 
439,i had a dream that i made a podcast.,so in the podcast me and my friends were in this booth that was owned by elon musk for some reason and we started recording a podcast but a few of us could not hear each other so one half of the conversation could not be heard by the other we were recording for like hour but when it was rendered out there was only like minutes anyways one friend edited it and we listened to it and we listened to it we listened to it but it was a cacophony of noise with different effects i decided to recreate it with my own friends in discord amp 
440,weird teacher dream,i cannot stop thinking about the weird teacher dream i had last night for some context i am now a teacher i teach high school and i m years old i recently graduated and i d say the relationship i m in rn is healthy and happy the dream i had last night was so strange and memorable that i wonder if it has any underlying meaning i was in a classroom full of students i think i was a student also the older teacher a handsome gentlemen had his hand on my leg and was sitting next to me in a way that would imply we were in some kind of romantic relationship however he was proudly caressing my leg and being cuddly with me in front of the other students then a teacher that i had from high school that i used to have a crush on walked in and suddenly the older teacher and i started dancing it was bizarre that s all i can remember but it seemed oddly specific and weird thoughts lol 
441,shadows,i could go on and on about the nightmares or sleep paralysis i have for hours usually when i do see shadows or sleep demons it s regular for me laugh out loud but this last one really made me uncomfortable this one i saw a lady with a yellow cardigan and grey pants normally they are dark figures or the peer at me so i can t really see them well she was standing half behind my curtain i couldn t see her whole face but she was waving reaching for me at first i wasn t scared but my dog appeared in the dream and he started to growl and bark at the figure then i realized it was a shadow figure and i told it to leave me alone but of course it started to act up an fade in and out at this point in every one of my nightmares i know i m dreaming so i tell myself to wake up i woke up and i had to sit for awhile because if i fall asleep to soon i go back into the dream i fell back asleep some time later this time i was looking up at myself standing next to my bed and i yelled what are you doing out of my body there s a shadow lady then myself jumped into myself and i woke up here are the parts i d like answers or feedback why did i dream of a shadow in colour why was my dog there i never dream of him in my nightmares what does it mean to see myself outside of my body 
442,sometimes good dreams don’t make me feel good,lately i ve been having intense vivid dreams and last night i had a dream that felt good but also made me feel kinda depressed all day i dreamt that i was with a girl that i let get away we were spending a lot of time together and talking and she admitted to me that she did really like me but because i never said anything about it she lost hope and moved on i haven t talked to this person in a long while but that dream felt like i was actually talking it all through with her i ll be more active here as i ll probably use this as a public dream journal since my dreams have been so vivid 
443,"took psychedelics in my dream and felt the effects, i’ve never taken them in real life before?",i can never usually remember my dreams as i am a very deep sleeper and i have never had a lucid dream before i have always been too scared to take psychedelics because i don t want to have a bad trip or have any long term effects however a couple of nights ago i had a dream where i took magic mushrooms and i knew i was dreaming whilst i was on them i was laughing uncontrollably and was so happy i could also see things melting and the colours of everything around me were very vibrant but the whole time i knew i was dreaming and i felt like everything in my head had just became clear i knew what my purpose was and my purpose was to take shrooms when i woke up the whole time i was saying to myself why have i always been so scared this is amazing i need to do this when i wake up it s hard to describe the feeling but i felt like my brain had just opened up and unfogged when i woke up i remembered everything and was left confused i ve tried to research what this dream could mean online but i can t really find anything to help so if anyone knows i d really like to hear it 
444,dreamt a genie gave me a cup with dreams to share with everyone,it was a grey big genie called temple he gave me a long wine cup full of yellow lights and each represented a dream of my own and said whichever i had swallow would spread throughout everyone is subconscious while i was running around the contents of the cup spilled like water though and very few remained i asked if i could have more again but i do not remember if i got it or not i remember i traveled through different versions of my life every time i closed my eyes and thought of going somewhere else i had end up in another timeline in the timelines i decided what dreams to swallow and share i remember eating one about a dream that made others understand there may be conflicts but peace can be found nevertheless or something like that in one the genie kept insisting what do you really want to send and sent me to a timeline where the world was ending so i was going to die soon and felt pressured and i tried to transmit a dream where people could understand or feel that things will be ok and that there is more after our deaths i find fun how strange some locations were it was something like seeing different situations about alternative versions of myself and affecting them somehow then when they had a good moral i had share it in the one about conflicts i think i was fighting a friend then as a gift he made the floor be like a starry sky while in the sky above it was daylight and i could play around and swim in the floor night if i wanted it to change from solid to liquid overwall i was not completely lucid and i feel like i was annoyed in most timelines for different stuff like for not actually waking up irl wish i had been more lucid hope someone dreamt that everything is gonna be ok i guess xd
445,repeated dream patterns?,does anyone else notice this for maybe th of my dreams i ll be with somebody i enjoy their company or something and then the setting just switches as it normally does and subconsciously when its not really related to the story or missions of the dreams but yet i am still trying to find them i spend the rest of my sleep looking for this person never end up finding them or seeing them again though oh also emotions are very strong like i actually feel emotional about it like in my dreams laugh out loud i do not even know has anyone else noticed an odd pattern like this for me its like dreams are like this if not all thanks 
446,dream interpretation please,hi all i had two really strange dreams today which both involve the sea the one that i ca not stop thinking about was that i was on a boat with my mother is side of the family the both was small but had different rooms i had a vision that the boat was going to be broken by some rogue waves and we would all be lost at shore when i told my family that did not believe me and that night it happened the waves crashed through the boat and we had to create an escape plan my two younger cousins were on the boat and in the dream i was crying and telling my family to go and i would stay behind with my cousins my reason for me staying behind was because i felt like my family had more to live for because i myself am not a mother i was the only one with no life jacket as there were none left i put the life jackets on my younger cousins while everyone else went ahead there was an island at sight and we were all trying to get there the waves were still rogue and both of my cousins went underwater i dived down to save them we all survived and made it to the island i saw my mother and i approached her but she would not speak to me for context i did have an argument with my mother last week and i have not been in touch with her since and we have not spoken 
447,i dreamt i pulled a dead cockroach out of my right eye,it was so fucking creepy i was in front of the mirror and i felt my right eye itch saw a strand of hair stick out from inside my lower lash line and pulled out a whole dead roach 
448,dream about protecting my spider girlfriend from the government,i had a weird dream last night that i had a girlfriend who was part spider from the waist down like a centaur and she was really sweet and just like a normal person but the government deemed her a threat and tried to kill her i spent the majority of the dream trying to help her hide in my house and i gave tearful speeches explaining that she was a wonderful person despite her strange experience but no matter what i did nothing seemed to help in the end she went into a cocoon and told me to get away from her as she didn t know what she would turn into and was afraid she might hurt me after sobbing a lot i realized that in this cocoon state she was a sitting duck and couldn t defend herself so instead of running i stayed ever vigilant guarding my house about a week had passed and the government finally found her again and were trying to break into my house when spider girlfriend shows up to reveal that in her cocoon she just grew wings she picked me up and we flew away thus it was actually she who protected me in the end what the fuck tbh one of the most moving dreams of my lifetldr dreamt that i had a gf who was part spider and i had to protect her from getting killed by the government
449,old woman gave me grapes and a pep talk,last night i had a dream that my mother and i were taking a walk together on this sort of nature trail this is a bit odd considering that my mother has difficulty walking and it was just us i have kids and nieces nephews so it wasn t a kid family outing but anyway we were just walking and enjoying the views we stopped by a little stream to watch it and rest for a bit nearby was an elderly couple a man and a woman i remember the woman was very short i m and she was significantly shorter than me and appeared a bit frail but not sickly the man never spoke but the woman immediately lit up and approached me she had some grapes and offered me some at first i assumed she was somewhat senile perhaps but she was very friendly and sweet so i agreed she handed me two grapes and they had some dirt on them but i thanked her told her i loved grapes and i d wash them off and eat them she kept the conversation going and though i can t remember exact verbiage she told me that i was somebody s world and how much i was loved and how important i was as she spoke she showed me two white lilies growing near the stream with two apples on the ground beside them so two grapes two white lilies and two apples what does this mean as she spoke it felt less like some random kind old lady spreading kind words to a stranger and felt more like a message meant directly for me somebody that i didn t know but they knew me in the dream i remarked to my mother that it didn t feel like a friendly stranger it felt like i d just spoken to an angel or something i m not even religious lol i remember even this random bystander agreed it was odd this wasn t like the type of dreams i usually have a lot of my dreams i m not even me i m some random character in whatever plot my mind makes up when i am me it s usually the same repetitive themes of like losing my car in a parking lot or being late for work or whatever when i woke up the odd feeling of this means something hung around all day i ve struggled with mental health in the past but not currently so i m not sure what the pep talk was about but it left an impact still kinda feel weird about it i d also love to know if anyone has insight on what the symbolism of grapes white lilies apples things in pairs is all about lol
450,trigger your dream characters with one sentence.,you ever have those times in dream where you say one sentence that may may not be offensive make sense and immediately everyone in the dream reacts in some excessive way if so what did you say and how did they react 
451,i dreamt of a voice trying to convert me,i dreamt just lying in my bed when suddenly things became blacker and a deep voice called out to me and said say i am an atheist in french to which i replied in french no i am a muslim a tearing scream tore the skies and i woke up in the exact same position i saw myself in my dream this was two years ago and my faith has been rattled since i am not good with french either 
452,guests,guests if you see guests in a dream it means you are about to face a challenge it s time to examine your emotions carefully and give them a good scrub so your dreams are clear and bright again 
453,weirdest (and grossest) dreams i've ever had.,the dream was pretty short but very vivid and just super strange if anyone knows what it may mean i had appreciate lol i was outside walking beneath a tree all of a sudden my head started itching horribly i reached up to scratch it and felt a tick embedded in my scalp i picked the tick off i even remember hearing the little snap and thinking oh fuck the head may still be in my skin i then tossed the tick up in the air and a freaking dragonfly swooped in and snatched it out of the air then flew away with the tick 
454,sleep paralysis,iv had sleep paralysis a couple of times before i m a very calm and aware person and they aren t in like a nightmare way or dream way more of just like i wake up but i can t move or do anything but one time was different usually if i calm down try to let my body relax and try to jolt myself awake it works after a couple of attempts but for this time in particular when ever i tried to move i would feel my brain tense up and it would hurt a bit and i m very self aware in these types of dreams so i knew better then to freak out and make things worse and when i woke up my brain was in a light pain the only thing i think about now is that was the one time in my life i felt like that could have killed me had i went about it wrong and was wondering if this type of sleep paralysis dream has like a name or if anyone els has experienced this 
455,i have hyper realistic nightmares that repeat,i don t know what it means they can get very graphic and scary and they repeat i ve had them since i was in kindergarten not sure how to prevent them
456,"i’ve started having frequent dreams where i try to yell and nothing comes out or i’m trying to walk or run but can’t, like i’m too heavy or tired. what does this mean?",it s things like i m in a fight with my ex and i want to yell or raise my voice or even just talk and i can t just little croaks come outor i m trying to get home from work walking and my legs won t move they just drag and i m exhaustedit makes me feel stuck in my own dreams what is this about 
457,what visited me?,a few years ago one of my great aunts died my relationship with this aunt was not very close as i grew older but i knew i would always be welcomed in their home within a couple of weeks after their death i received a very vivid dream involving them and an animal the dream itself was simple and straightforward i was in my room followed an ethereal looking sting ray out into the front door and there stood my aunt she told me she loved me and that i was doing everything right that she was watching over me i was baffled because i had not seen her in years and almost did not recognize her i woke up and immediately googled the animal it was said to signify to let go of fear and have faith that you were on the right path that something new would be achieved soon that your intuition will guide you well i had never really been into this kind of thing and had really knowledge on it so this felt oddly specific and intentional i have a lot of conflict wondering if i am just making things worse in my life so this was definitely relevant at the time i know this is spiritual in nature but i am not sure what culture to research more of or how to interpret this dream is this what a spirit animal is this is my first time dreaming of an animal that has stood out like this 
458,loud whispers in my dream. not sleep paralysis?,f i have an ok sleep schedule anything from pm am and then i wake up around or am was just awoken at am with a bad dream it has a long backstory but i got into bed in my dream and i lived in the same country but not the same place dream was bizarre enough but not very scary just a lot of absurd stuff going on i went to bed and i apparently had seen a tiktok earlier that day about how witch screams usually means danger i didn t think much of it until i heard a very different scream outside my window i thought ok whatever i live in the city people scream here and then i heard it again at this point i started feeling my covers in real life because i was clutching onto them because i felt something bad was about to happen but the rest of my state was in the dream only as i held onto my covers loud whispers filled the room and i had some dark spirits holding me down that s when i woke up and made a weird sounding agh sound not very loud but i was obviously terrified now is this a sleep paralysis or what when i google anything regarding whispering and dreams that s the only result i get 
459,recurring nightmares of self defense killings,i have been going through a lot of stress recently and having trouble sleeping when i do sleep i have terrible nightmares that wake my wife they involve me killing people in self defense last night i dreamt that i was doing field training i am a combat medic in the army i entered a building trying to clear it to make a ccp casualty collection point i found someone in there but instead of shooting at me with blanks he had a cross now and tried to kill me i tacked him then i grabbed a crossbow bolt and began stabbing him he did not bleed but holes the same size as the bolt appeared in him and he went down i immediately started to treat him i tried to open a hyfin chest seal but inside were a bunch of smaller chest seals when i opened those something was wrong with them as well but i ca not remember what i decided to stop wasting time with them and move on i saw his leg was hit as well and tried to put a tourniquet around it the wound was too high up though so it would not fit i looked for gauze or bandages but i could not find any then his skin started to turn bright red almost like someone who is freezing to death turns blue i remember thinking that meant he was going into shock from internally bleeding and that i needed to hurry it does not mean that i then tried to find a transfusion kit but i did not know his blood type or have anyone around to get a donation from i asked for someone to call for a medevac but they simply refused saying i needed to treat the patient i did not have anything to treat him with so i just watched in horror as he died people around me kept saying i was terrible for letting this happen i remember this overwhelming feeling of fear and impending doom another time i was near the armory and someone broke in to steal the weapons he took a lot of stuff and started killing people i grabbed my rifle from in the armory and killed him the military police showed up and thought i was the active shooter and started shooting i killed them and ran police kept stopping me and when i tried to explain they would raise their weapons and fire i had kill them and keep running as fast as i could at some point i tried to find my team leader thinking he would know what to do but when i got there he would not listen he pulled out an m pistol and tried to kill me too i kept trying to find people to listen but they would all try to kill me before i could explain by the time the dream ended i had killed everyone on post i was curled up in a ball clutching my m like my life depended on it i felt that same sense of dread and impending doom i have no idea what they mean and i am tired of not sleeping does anyone have an idea 
460,is there a way to dream less?,i have a pretty long history of weird sleep issues as a kid i was a frequent sleepwalker and suffered from sleep paralysis on a regular basis until i found out sleeping on my side gets rid of it lol as well as vivid dreams nightmares i ve also had trouble falling asleep starting at around the same age i mention this because i feel like it might be relevant as an adult i still deal with trouble falling asleep i m also a very light sleeper as well as bouts of vivid dreams that usually last about a week at a time every night they re often disturbing not always but don t usually deal directly with any trauma i ve experienced they re not the usual nightmare culprits either being chased feeling of drowning etc but instead just weird scenarios most recently i ve dreamt about watching all of my neighbors jump off their balconies during a hurricane going to the grocery store at night and getting lost and my dog biting my nose really hard lol i wake up feeling exhausted whenever i have these vivid dreams especially when they re of a disturbing nature is there any way to dream less or just less vividly i do find when i dream but they aren t as vivid i don t end up as exhausted in the morning 
461,childhood night terrors strapped to the front of a rocket,starting around age through around years old i used to get pretty intense night terrors sleep running and screaming through my house while immersed in a nightmare in one of my first ones i was running up and down the walls and also on the ceiling and it absolutely terrified me for some reason but irl i was just running up and down the hallway another one i had i was convinced that i was cerberus the headed dog and i was jumping on tables on all fours barking at my parents this is all after going to sleep i was dreaming like my own version of reality in this particular one though that still kinda stumps me i was completely immersed in a different reality and i remember it very clearly i was still sleep walking and running through the house during it screaming and whatnot but i only know that because my family would tell me after i woke up this dream also reoccured a couple times but basically it would start with me walking through this seeming nuclear wasteland dark orange ish sky hilly dead grass plains with a winding dirt road going through it i would always go in the same direction the road was leading but in a straight line not following the winding path of the road in one experience there was a small wooden fence in my way and in an attempt to climb over it it snapped beneath me and it induced this super intense moment of fear for some reason i remember the wood of the fence was very fragile tho it was easy to break like it was freeze dried eventually each time i would reach my destination a big ass rocketship i dont remember much what it looked like just that it was dark and fucking megalithic i would never stop to admire it or anything and i dont remember experiencing the process of getting from the ground up to the top of the rocket but next thing i know i would be fixed to the very tip of the nose and shot through space at light speed i remember it being absolutely terrifying beyond anything i could fathom at the time it felt exactly how i imagine it would feel being strapped to the front of a rocket like my skin was being pulled back and my body was just jello being flattened by the g forces never heard of anyone having a similar dream closest thing i have found is michael pollens description of his meo dmt experience but i dont think there was actually a rocket for him i think he was just describing that cannon feeling of dmt which i have not done has anyone ever had a similar dream i am now and i still think about it a lot and remember it very well just never made since why my brain would conjure such a bizarre and intense experience 
462,reoccurring dream but different last night,i keep having a dream very often about bears i have seen bears in real life in my home country in the wild and was pretty scared so that is one reason i think i keep having these dreams usually i am pretty afraid of the bear in these dreams they re always brown bears or grizzly last night i dreamed that i was in my grandparents small town where i spent a lot of time as a child i saw a huge grizzly bear sitting in the distance and started to run home to get away because i was afraid then the bear started to chase me and i was very afraid i knew i couldn t outrun and i was terrified when it catches up to me i look at it and realize it turned into my grandparents dog from my childhood which was very special to me a chocolate lab dog which passed away years ago i kept running and the dog was next to me running with me i want to know if anyone sees any deep or profound meaning possibly for this dream especially since i ve been going through and emotionally devastating time changing stressful time in my life and i can t shake this feeling like this dream has a deeper message that dog also was important to me so it made me emotional it made me feel really weird 
463,weird dream,i had such a weird dream recently i dreamt that my mother died previously to her death in the dream we were hanging out and planning on joining the gym together which is unusual since we have a really toxic relationship in my waking life but then coming up to us going news came to me and she was killed she was shot and died instantly and i felt incredibly depressed in my dream i went for a walk to walk it off mostly to think and tears were just poring down my face i felt so sad and abandoned i want to trigger warning k ll myself i woke up and i feel really sad does this dream mean anything 
464,any ideas on what this dream could mean?,i remember pulling out this skinned creature from btwn my legs out from my uterus this creature was feeding from me once i took it out it i refused to look at it but i could feel it following me i expressed to my mom my terror and she pointed out that the creature was just a dog it turned out to be very sweet and kind of cute is there any significance here 
465,first ever super vivid lucid dream!,i had a normal dream at first but suddenly my vision turned all white i can feel my physical body laying in bed but my mind is still in the dream i hope this makes sense it is just that i ca not move a few seconds later i feel like my physical body is in a train like it is moving as if i am laying on the train floor surface and i remember seeing black shadow figure in the middle of my white vision it looked like it was carrying me all of a sudden i woke up but it was not my room not a place i recognized but it was super vivid i was standing in an empty classroom wearing school uniform and it was a sunny day at that moment i was scared as hell because i touched my body and it feels like i am physically there while i am still panicking i heard someone called my name and saw two girls and two guys classmates friends with books in their hands outside the door like they are waiting for me so that we could go to wherever class we have to go to i was still freaked out at the time so i just made up random excuses that i need to go somewhere first so they should just go first and ran to whatever corridor i saw trying to find toilet well i ended up running to the end of corridor and found a store with lots of empty boxes after calming myself down i just realized oh this is probably lucid dream people said you can do anything in lucid dream so i tried moving the empty boxes hoping i have telekinesis power it barely moves but it still proved the point that it was a lucid dream i guess i can even see my energy colour it was light blue or cyan i do not remember soon after i heard my alarms and it is like i am slowly fading and finally opened my eyes here i had auditory hallucinations when i woke up because i literally heard ocean waves like you heard when you go to the beach at my right ear for a few minutes it is probably because i slept on my right side at the time 
466,i’m never myself in my dreams,for as long as i can remember when i dream i am not myself i am never the same person in my dreams sometimes it a dream with a bunch of strangers or people i know i m just of the time not myself in dreams since i ve had my daughter i do dream as myself more often i am a person who has been able to replay dreams change dreams and most recently able to realize this isn t right my husband finds it extremely weird i m never myself in my dreams and have never met anyone who dreams the same way anyone else out there with this experience what does it even mean

474,work dream,i was at work i am a server and i went to deliver a bill to a really tall guy who was with a normal sized woman and somehow the area was halfway to a pig sty which meant i had to deal with it after they left when i got to them they asked if i could split the check by item and while it is easier to do that at a counter with how the system is set up and it is just between two people it is still a massive pain to do there was a pen nearby from an empty table is that i could have used since i do not usually carry one around with me but i did not grab it because i woke up and realized while my alarm went off that it was just a dream and i did not have to split it 
475,dream with a couple fighting naked,i had this dream that i was in a bakery and when i looked at the other side of the street i saw a couple fighting naked and i looked at it for some time and then suddenly the woman looked at me and came to my direction with a knife then i ran away and the dream ended

477,monster fight,this the third dream i had in one night this dream was about monsters fighting it was a mixture of mad max and battle botts it was dusty and desolate outside and very hot i was cheering on a giant he looked like a cross between a man and a troll from lotr he was winning fight after fight the crowd was going crazy i think i bet on him and i was filling my pockets with coins it came time for the next opponent to show up this opponent frightened me to my core from very far away i could see the monster approach it was surrounded by people holding ropes attached to its body i saw the silhouette of a huge gorilla on the horizon first it was all in shadow because the sun was directly behind it but it was huge and i wanted to hide i did not want to see this fight i felt that if this gorilla were to lay eyes on me then i had become it is prey i found a spot to hide in an old chicken coop i guess i am a chicken lol it took forever for the gorilla to get to the fighting arena i peeked out when the giant and the gorilla were about to go in the fighting cage the gorilla was scanning the crowd and i felt that it was looking for me i noticed a few things seeing it up close it was female it is furry coat was brown and she had curved horns on her head that swooped downward then turned back to point straight up she looked confused as to why she was there i was no longer scared of her i knew that she was being forced to fight i thought what the hell am i doing here and i woke up 
478,last night i felt like i lived years in a dream. this has never happened before.,it started on some sort of military helicopter flying over seas then landing in a warzone the dream was just me and my squad no recognizable faces hiding in one spot and then the next and another so on until we came across some sort of town centre with thousands of people packed together and the ground was littered with balloons i accidentally kicked a balloon and as it went into the air helicopters started to rain fire i can barely comprehend what i witnessed after that but most of my focus was on surviving i kept my eyes on the skies and ran once in a while jumping to the ground for cover or under someone s body i kept hearing i will get us out of here from all those who were running with me my dream ended with me lifting floorboards trying to hide innocent people obviously a short summary but this dream truly felt like it lasted years the part that replays in my head is the balloons it was like i started a war with the kick of a balloon i often dream of balloons but never like this just had to get this off my chest i woke up this morning caked in sweat and so relieved to be awake 
479,i hit my boyfriend in a nightmare,so i have really bad abandonment issues and i had a nightmare that involved my boyfriend abandoning me basically the the dream was him and i were gonna go somewhere together but he wasn t there so i texted him asking where he was and he was with his friends instead i called him and someone else picked up and i could hear him in the background the person who picked up told me he didn t want to speak to me and they were mean to me and was mocking me then i remembered being really mad and really sad i remember the emotions felt so real maybe it s because my bf and i recently had a fight because of a situation a bit similar to this not exactly the same thing at all but the situation had left me feeling like he abandoned me for his friends so the feelings in the dream were very real although this is something we talked about and he apologized for it s still something i m healing from and something i m still gaining the broken trust in him back from but the way he reacted to me in the dream was a lot different than how he would react irl but anyways after the phone call he somehow appeared in front of me in the dream i told him how mad i was at him and he just kept ignoring me this is where i hit him not hard but i don t know why i did it he didn t even react to it in the dream it s not something i would do irl no matter what emotions i was experiencing it really shocked me and i really don t like that it happened in the dream maybe it s just a strange manifestation from something else the night before this dream i accidentally elbowed him when he tickled me out of nowhere and surprised me i felt really bad and apologized profusely he found it kinda funny and kept making jokes about how he was a victim and i just kept apologizing i really don t think i would ever hurt him on purpose this whole dream was a reflection of my fears so perhaps that was just another fear to make the dream worse but still the whole dream has left me feeling weird but that part specifically stands out to me 
480,nsfw tw rape blood i think i need help here,so i nb keep having these repeating dreams about being raped in the last couple of weeks i think it would help me to know what other people think of those dreams and maybe you have recommendations on how i can make it stop i wish that dreams were not connected to what i have experienced but i am pretty sure i have experienced child molestation back in my childhood although those are repressed memories and i do not really remember the molestation itself though i remember what happened before and after and it really affects my dreams so the first dream i had was about me having an ability of travelling in time and i was in s or something and there were two men who were my friends colleagues and we went to work and then we turned out to be in some kind of a corner of abandoned house and one of those men ran away and the other covered my mouth with my hand and started touching me without my permission the next thing i remember is me running away from these situation and continue travelling in time the second dream was shorter than the previous one i was at home in my bathroom and there were two men and they were naked and one of them told me to take my clothes off and i thought to myself that this kind of stuff is going to happen again right now and when i took off all of my clothes i woke up the last dream was the scariest of them all to be honest i was in a bookshop looking through books i want to read when suddenly the man appeared behind my back and he covered my eyes with something and said that i deserve it and then he took me somewhere else in this building and when i opened my eyes i was laying in some kind of a corridor and it was white and empty and i looked down and i was naked and covered in blood and i started running from floor to floor of this building looking for help when i saw three men and i shouted to them that i am hurt and need help but they just looked at me and went away and then i woke up i noticed some patterns of those dreams the first pattern is that i never experienced the rape itself in those dreams it is always before and after and the second pattern is that i have never seen faces of men who did that it is some kind of a dark figure and sometimes it is just voice that i hear to be honest here i am scared and concerned and i want this to stop but i also want to know why i keep having those kind of dreams i hope it is okay to bring those kind of topics here 
481,owl dream,so the dream starts out with me hiding from a man i do not know in a house once he leaves i go around locking all the windows and as i get to the last one a owl flys up and lands on the window sill i was cautious at first but it looked like it wanted me to pet it so i did after petting it for a minute a larger owl showed up and it could talk it pushed it is face into my hand so i would pet it too as i pet this one it warned me about something bad i think but i ca not remember what it was

489,augmentin dreams,i ve taken augmentin many times before but this time it s given me vivid surreal dreams almost every night which has never happened before last night s dream was an eternal nightmare where i ended up wanting to die because someone showed me that we were trapped in a simulation and didn t know how deep the layers were later discovered that even death didn t end it as one would immediately be reborn into this hell a cursory search shows that others have had this enhanced dream experience on augmentin and other antibiotics let s hear about some similar experiences 
490,a heart pounding nightmare that turned into a semi-psychedelic event.,i will preface this by stating i am not taking any recreational drugs or prescription medication i recently joined this sub and want to hear from everyone and take in different opinions the dream will be kept short but will highlight major events throughout it starts with me in the back of what seems to be a moving passenger van almost in a paralyzed state i m laying down almost flat on my back and can see the back of the seat in front of me moments later men around my age come peaking climbing over the seat in a hurry to look at me the looks on their faces were neutral almost like they were bored every once in awhile they would talk amongst each other and laugh then right back to the neutral face i just lay there gazing and listening they did not talk to me for awhile and i was still paralyzed then the van slowed to take a sharp turn and one of them says grab the hammer this is where i freak out he grabs a hammer looks at me with no expressions and says i m going to crack the top of your skull until you are dead yup heart is pouring at this point i don t remember pleading with the men i just remember the swift hammer coming down and me going lights out after lights out is when the dream gets hard to remember i m in a state of floating but i don t take the shape of a human body i m something else there are so many others around me who are similar but i know something is wrong i felt so much fear in this place and the others were constantly trying to pull me in closer to them as if they wanted to huddle around me i vividly remember trying with everything in my being to get as far away as possible from these entities i managed to slowly very slowly ascend away from them still while freaking out the entire time once i was far enough away boom transported back to the passenger van in the back seat like someone pushed a reset button same scenario but this time when i was hit with the hammer i actually woke up i woke up in my room pitch black and all i can see were geometric shapes floating around some of them in the shape of detailed faces all the faces were smiling kind of creepily this event only lasted seconds as soon as i woke up the only thing i can compare it to is a psilocybin mushroom trip comparatively it was not nearly as strong as what i just experienced if anyone has thoughts feel free to share i would like to hear what you all have to say

501,"what is the significance of vivid, gory, violent dreams (and one about my dog)?",since as far back as i can remember i ve had extremely gruesome dreams every now and then when i was i watched my eyes roll out of my head and blood pour out of my empty eye sockets i still remember this dream so vividly and it s one of the least gory ones i have had i have had so many that i can t even remember them all and they don t usually bother me anymore except recently i had a dream that gt my dog except he looked more wolf like was lying dead on my driveway with someone shredding his mouth throat stomach with some sort of sharp object and ripping pieces of inside the poor dog out of his mouth blood was fucking everywhere and my dog s eyes just looked at me so empty lt i woke up shortly after not really in a panic but feeling kind of disturbed and unsettled i have gory dreams about people including young children a lot but not animals especially not my pets except one other time which was what happened in the dream when i was except of my other dog i do not know if any of this means anything but it s weird i don t actively watch gory things although i had a brief phase in middle school where i sometimes watched it but these dreams began before that overall my dreams have been getting so much more vivid and life like and they are kind of meshing with my actual memories

504,"chronicles of my weirdass dreams: the ""altar of fire""",so i am very prone to bizarre vivid and overly elaborate dreams i also do not always dream in first person like in this weird and tbh pretty disturbing dream i had last weekend in the dream there was this village where every so often members of a specific bloodline are demanded for sacrifice to their god via immobilization in a cement like wall before the wall is slowly wheeled with the people still alive into the altar of fire a small freestanding room outdoors in the middle of the village where you can see literal flamethrowers going off from every angle inside family members have to kneel down in front of the horrific scene in a show of respect until it s over you re allowed to look down close your eyes and cover your ears though some wise old lady is the religious leader of the village and the medium through which their god tells the people who needs to be sacrificed sacrifices are usually two people at a time the god never fully wipes out any bloodline though most villagers believe the god needs sacrifices to nourish him and that this magnanimous god only picks sacrifices from bloodlines with a stable population every so often so that no bloodline is ever destroyed by the sacrifices there s also a tiny weirdo subgroup in the village though who believes that every couple of generations a bloodline needs purification until its only surviving fertile members are the ones favored by god like some weird bastardization of natural selection the subgroup s belief is supported by the fact that the god has only ever demanded the sacrifice of fertile people it must be to keep them from breeding any more non favored villagers families are also fucking huge in this village it s normal to have at least kids while it s considered weird to stop having kids after your fifth child that s why this one young woman the protagonist of this dream let is name her protagonist since she never got a name has a weird immediate family in the eyes of other villagers she s the second youngest of five siblings one day protagonist is father discovers from the wise old lady that their bloodline is being demanded for sacrifice and that they will learn the names of the first two family members to be fed to the altar of fire very soon the family does not immediately pack their shit and leave because honor and duty and obligation to your village or something anyway what s so special about protagonist is that she has the secret supernatural power to go back in time and redo things the only problem though is when she goes back to a certain point in time she is not the her that was there at that point there s two of her at the same time now the first time she ever used her power as a kid she ended up having to shoot her other self dead to keep things from ending in disaster and she disposed of the body in the altar of fire from then on protagonist taught herself that if she ever suddenly discovers a symbol etched onto her forehead it means another her from the future has marked her for death before unfreezing time and doing whatever needs to be done differently the second time around protagonist never knows when she s going to find the symbol etched on her forehead but if it happens she has to stop whatever she s doing and hide from everyone s sight until she can reach the altar of fire and immolate herself as her new self carries on in her place a pretty terrifying existence i had say after learning from her dad that people from her bloodline will need to be sacrificed protagonist tries to do this thing where she repeatedly goes back in time back before the wise old lady got the message from god about needing members of protagonist s bloodline for sacrifice and keeps sacrificing her duplicates to the altar of fire in an attempt to satiate the god so he won t need any more members of her bloodline this leads to a lot of reliving the same horrific announcement from her father she d be like dammit and pick another spot to go back in time and just do it again i ll be honest most of the dream is just her doing this over and over again and still receiving the same announcement from her father and getting increasingly distressed eventually protagonist hits a breaking point and she confides in her only friend about her bloodline being chosen for sacrifice he s her friend because they both belong to weird families hers is weird because her parents couldn t conceive again after child his is weird because he s from that weirdo subgroup i was talking about earlier protagonist spills the beans to him about her powers while crying wondering out loud why everything she was doing wasn t enough for their god that s when her friend tells her about the shit his subgroup believes in the whole pseudo natural selection thing basically protagonist is friend tells her that god isn t satisfied because it s not her that he wants she is favored by god probably for her superpowers and god wants her to carry on such a favored lineage until enough generations have passed and the bloodline needs another spring cleaning i guess protagonist gets angry with him and insists he must be wrong she storms out and keeps trying and trying to immolate more duplicates of herself but eventually she realizes he s right and it s useless when protagonist eventually catches up to the present again her family learns that the first two people to be sacrificed are protagonist s oldest brother and one of her older cousins around the brother s age whom she fights with a lot they have three days to make peace with their fate before they must report to the wise old lady to be immobilized and burned alive together on the third night surrounded by their family protagonist tells her little sister that she mustn t look at the carnage and that she must plug her ears when they have to kneel down next to each other apparently god is merciful for allowing family members to cover their eyes and ears if they can t bear to witness the sacrifice i think it s also hinted that the little sister may have some sort of secret powers of her own anyway we get to the actual sacrifice and it is disturbing as shit everyone in the family kneels before the altar and helplessly watches as these young men stripped naked and stuck inside a wall contraption get slowly wheeled into the altar of fire and burned alive you can vividly hear their terrified shrieks and screams of agony until they finally die and their remains turn to ash after the sacrifice the old lady announces that god has just spoken to her and named the next two to be sacrificed this time it s protagonist s older sister and second oldest brother just like before the pair have three days to make peace with their fate before they too will die in the altar of fire all of this is just too much for protagonist to handle so in a desperate frenzy she goes back in time again before the news of god wanting her bloodline this time though instead of marking her duplicate for death protagonist plots with her duplicate by claiming to be sent by god on a special mission the duplicate waits a few minutes and then goes back to that spot in time repeating this over and over again until protagonist now has a giant group of duplicates from slightly different times all together at once do not ask me how this logic works then this group sneaks into the home of the wise old lady at night and kills her tossing her body into the altar of fire after that the group works together to destroy the altar of fire once the altar of fire is reduced to nothing but rubble on the ground the group hides out somewhere and practices reciting the same shit in unison for the rest of the night when dawn arrives and villagers come out to see the rubble where the altar of fire once stood protagonist and her group of duplicates walk over to the scene together like a cult and do a semicircle around the rubble delivering a speech in perfect unison that god is no longer interested in sacrifices and that the wise old lady has failed him so she is dead then the group declares itself the new ruling council chosen by god everyone is like wow there s a whole group of protagonist clones saying all this shit in unison this must be a sign from god so they accept the group of duplicates as their new religious authority after everything is said and done the main version of protagonist aka the only one in the group who saw her family burned alive before going back and starting a duplicate gang and telling them it was a mission from god asks another one of her duplicates for a favor she asks her to go back and bring another duplicate into the group to replace the main version of protagonist her duplicate is confused but agrees she asks the main version of the protagonist what to do about the weirdo subgroup they re suspicious of the protagonist duplicates and believe this whole thing to be an evil sacrilegious trick the main version of protagonist says deal with them however you must they cannot upset the new order or many more people will die the main version of protagonist then slips out of the village alone and finds a way to immolate herself because she can no longer bear the trauma of seeing her family members burned alive even though they are no longer dead now and she feels too much guilt for committing crimes against god by orchestrating the coup because she was too weak and too selfish to just let her family or anyone else die for god anymore anyways then i woke up

506,dreamt about losing my grandpa,normally i didn t really believe in the idea that dreams can sometimes predict reality that definitely changed since nights ago i had a dream about my grandfather passing out at home in real life he has passed out before and recently had pretty bad health problems but in this dream on the night of my grandfather passed out and my family was freaking out and i had to call i woke up the next morning not thinking too much about the dream but was contemplating telling my parents since it was sad when i got up i simply went to use the bathroom and noticed my grandpa wasn t up yet even thought he normally gets up much earlier than everyone else i didn t think to much of it until i went back to sleep and my father woke me up to tell me to hold the door for the paramedics it took a while before i learned what happened but apparently my grandpa had a stroke in his sleep the left side of his brain went dead and doctors expected him to only live for a couple of days he passed away today around pm and i have only told me mother and sister about the dream it still feels surreal right now and even more surreal because of the dream

512,"found a dead crocodile, a toucan, and a peacock in my attic",not really expecting an explanation because it is kind of all over the place and quite bizarre but i still think it is worth sharing dreamed about this some time ago when i was about to move to a new house my old room had a loft which was really more of an attic than a loft made for storing things and whatever but i used it as a place to relax had some bean bags speakers and warm lighting in the dream i was just sitting at my computer in the lower floor when i heard some noise coming from the attic and started smelling something like rotten eggs no one should be there so i go up to see what was happening to my surprise i found a dead crocodile really bloated laying face down really big maybe feet or so to it is side a toucan balancing on a walking stick a really ornamented stick almost like it belonged to a wizard or something he was just standing there doing nothing getting illuminated from the side by some sunshine leaking trough the blinds i stand there for a good minute just frozen trying to understand what just happened and as i look to the right there was a peacock with it is tail fanned out giving a really bad vibe do not know why but i felt like i knew the peacock just killed the crocodile almost instantly i get freaked out by the situation and at the same time the rotten smell just gets worse by the minute once i get control back over my body i take this gigantic crocodile and with all my strength i load it over my shoulder and carry it down the stairs with the intent to take it out to the street it felt like something really urgent i needed to take it out to the street do not know the reason why after struggling for some time to carry the crocodile i get past the dining room and open the door to the entrance hallway which was covered in plants all the way from the floor to the ceiling looked like an abandoned building in the middle of the forest the task of carrying the animal on my back just get harder and harder from all the mud and plants grabbing on my feet after struggling a lot i manage to get to the front door once i open it there was a garbage collection truck ready at the door almost like they knew i was about to take out something big usually garbage collection in my city happens at pm this was during the daytime they take the body say thank you go on their way and i wake up i do not have any kind of special connection to this animals whatsoever they do not even exist where i live

518,may god help me,i posted on this subreddit a while back about a recurring dream i ca not find the original post but if you want to know some background information i had this dream eight times consecutively when i was ten and it was nearly the exact same only each night it would become more and more and more terrifying here is what happened two nights ago it started off with me being at my school then i open a door and i remember thinking to myself shit i am gonna be late to language arts it took me a few minutes of walking down that hallway to realize that this looked like the hallway to my old schools lunch cafeteria i look back and the door was gone i keep walking i soon realized that not only did the hallway look like the old school is hallway but it was cold just like it was in real life i end up passing by several doors and finally open one that leads to a set of hallways that looks like the floor of a hotel but as i keep walking i see an open door to what i thought was a gymnasium so i went to check it out but then i realized that this was not a gym it was a f ing empty theater on the stage were the instruments of an entire orchestra just propped there like that not a single soul i then kept walking and eventually reached an elevator i went in it and there was only one button and it had what appeared to be a cross inside of a circle i press the button and i am instantly in another hallway this time the walls are all white and at the end of the hallway is a pitch black door which i open and i see a massive ten story library with each floor having a balcony overlooking this atrium like space the floors ceilings bookshelves chairs tables everything was made of glass and i looked outside and i saw clouds i had no idea where i was i began to climb the stairs i reach a bookshelf and take out a book and begin to read it it was one sentence repeated over and over again in black ink i must not fear fear is the mind killer fear is the little death that brings total obliteration i will face my fear i will permit it to pass over me and through me and when it has gone past i will turn the inner eye to see its path where the fear has gone there will be nothing only i will remain i knew that this was the litany of fear from dune which i had recently finished reading but on top of this repeating sentence was another repeating sentence this time in red ink and it formed an awful looking smile the sentence in red was but what if i dont kill the mind what if i wont go past and you have one thing wrong you are not the one who will remain i am when i finished the sentence i heard an eerie piano song start playing i looked up and saw a thunderstorm off in the distance when i looked back down at the book it was closed which i had left it open and on the cover was the same smile this time widening more and more and more the dream ended with me waking up feeling as if i had just fallen from the stratosphere amp last night i had the exact same dream only this time i saw the most terrifying thing i have ever seen in a dream i am still trying to draw that thing i will post a picture of it when it is finished god almighty i do not know what to say 
519,"first post, hi!! horrible dream last night, i cannot escape.",i won t cloud with a lot of details last night i had a nightmare me my son and another family with a year old toddler were taking a tour of an old church the church was about floors all stairs i have a horrible fear of heights so i regretted taking the stairs immediately we got to about what i thought was the th floor where a portion of the staircase was missing the railing i immediately grabbed my sons hand and yanked him towards the wall as i turned around i saw the toddler waddle forward and ended up falling backwards off the side i immediately woke up and had to spend about minutes before going back to bed i just keep thinking about it i feel guilty for something that isn t real or didn t happen i told my husband i m feeling guilty i didn t grab the toddlers hand as well when i turned around he said he s had nightmares with similar situations and only time will help 
520,dreaming but staying awake ? body didn’t wanted to get up,either i was way to tired but my body simply didn t wanted me to wake up it lasted the whole time i was taking a nap my dream was just hearing my parents conversation and at the same time i was looking at them at the living room view it felt so strange because i knew what was going on and wanted to wake up but couldn t my mom even came to the room trying to wake me up and couldn t tried to lift the remote next to me to throw it to see if i can have some control but failed after a long time it started with one of my favorite songs playing in my head which made my leg twitch but forgot the rest of my song which made me stop but then continued to try and finally woke up just really exhausted i had sleep paralysis before but nothing like this was my body just that tired did anyone else experience this 
521,dreams becoming real,hello i am wondering if anyone else had ever had a dream and it then come true in real life i have had this happen a handful of times the most recent one i have had was about traffic lights installed in my town they put in two new lights at intersections that needed it four way stops on busy roads with lots of accidents in my dream the one closer to the target was turned on first then the one at the other end of the street turned on last a few days after this dream the local newspaper stated exactly what my dream had shown me it was so weird has anyone else ever had this happen can anyone explain why this happens sn most other predicted dreams are typically about relationships ending safe to say i am single 
522,1978,i do not know why but all of a sudden i was walking down a highway and it was the year i was born in so i have never lived in this time but yet here i was just walking in this different time i ca not remember ever travelling back in time in my dreams like this so it was interesting i ended up coming upon a college university campus and briefly speaking with some students that were hanging around outside they asked me who i was and i said i was from the future they did not seem to bat an eye at this and perhaps thought i was just in character or something it was the s after all some of them asked me what to expect in the future and if there is any interesting things i could say and i remember being a bit stumped and trying to find some stuff they could relate too i told them about planes flying into the twin towers in and realized that it is so far away they really would not understand or believe me i was drawing a blank to be honest trying to find something they may find interesting i spoke about computers and the such but that was typical then i finally realized that they were about to enter a massive energy crisis so i told them about that and then i woke up this dream kind of stuck with me these past few days i am trying to understand what the heck it means as i have never gone back in time i have insanely visual and interpretive dreams of all kinds and this one made me feel like i was on a mission of some kind hopefully it was a success 
523,do you ever have dreams inside other dreams?,i usually know when i am dreaming but sometimes i have dreams that are more realistic i guess i have fallen asleep inside a dream before but last night it was weirder i was having a dream i knew was a dream then i fell asleep in that dream i woke up and went to the bathroom while in the bathroom something seemed off that is when i realized i was not awake it was another dream when i realized it was a dream i woke up back in the other dream i woke up for real i think shortly after i do not know if it makes much sense but has anything like this ever happened to you 
524,"i had a dream where everyone got mad at me, how do i make myself feel less awkward around them in real life?",i had a dream where i made two people really upset at me by doing something and i live with both of them it is making me feel really awkward and guilty even though it was not real and they are not really upset with me but it is nagging at me i know that in real life i had never do what happened in the dream but i need a way to dissociate dream from reality a bit as it felt a little too real

527,i had two dreams in the same town just as two different people in the same night,first dream i was a man he was shy and fearful and married apparently he went into a town were two things had been released in search of his wife he went into the woods with a search party and found severed broken thighs and some weird very tall dear skeleton with no eyeholes and a head that is too small that was somehow walking around had a very long neck an weirdest of all it had googly eyes where the eye holes should be and it went around spooking the hell out of this guy eventually he went to a cabin after running away from it and that is where we found them they ate the other two explorers i was with it is hard to explain what they looked like but i ll trythey were very short bodied i guess with very thick legs that were the size of the body each had really weird looking eyes and a giant gaping mouth with thick teeth that were short in comparison to the mouth basically they chased this man into the cabin and they could not get through so he started screaming and yelling at them and they ran off they are easily spooked i guess and eventually he walked back to town and got on a bus where he meets the female character amp and then her dream happens basically same situation only she is not easily scared she goes into the woods fights the thing to the death her crew members die the thing dies she finds the severed thighs a tree falls down and she finds out inside of the trees have a bone anyway she goes to the field with the cabin and when the things show up she presses a button on her watch and is now wearing a mech suit she fires a missile and the things run off she also kills one of them anyway she runs to the town in her mech suit once she gets close enough to the bus stop she presses the button again and the mech suit returns to being a part of her normal suit which was all black she picks a backpack up and puts it on gets on the bus waits there for a bit and see is the guy get on she looks at her watch and see is that they are about to get eaten by a giant bat thing when she looks out the window the bus comes to a sudden stop and she pulls out a sword and the dream ends amp what does this mean does it even have a meaning 
528,i had a dream about world war 2 but the allies are losing,in my dream the year is france and britain have been defeated by the nazis the only remaining members of the allies are the united states and the soviet union the soviets are losing losing very badly despite the numbers of the red army and the material of the united states the nazis continue to push deeper and deeper into soviet territory i was an american soldier tasked out to a joint us soviet contingent to hopefully stop and counterattack against the nazi wave i get shipped across siberia from alaska since the us had defeated japan in the pacific i arrive to my unit which consistent of battle hardened soviet and american troops and begin our counterattack against the nazis initially our advance was smooth however this was a façade by the nazi forces before we are able to realize this my unit and i became encircled in the fields of what i believe was ukraine we were trapped in a flat and very farm like terrain a few of our guys including myself fall back behind a wall and attempt to return fire against enemy forces this was the most vivid part of my dream as i could very clearly feel the weight texture and recoil of the m rifle i was firing at the advancing nazis every time i had to reload i would fumble with my bandolier and pull out a fresh clip for my rifle despite all of our efforts and the supporting artillery from the rear the nazis continued to advance through our overwhelming fire until eventually reaching us and killing us it really felt like i had just experienced a past life or something because of how real it felt everything had weight and feeling to it i do not know though probably just a dream and nothing more 
529,"the ""sowers""",earlier today i posted about the weird dream i had last night and now i have done my best to draw them i do not think this drawing perfectly captured the sheer terror i felt but hopefully it helps you to visualize what i saw this is a link to the original post where i explain the dream in detail

537,weird reoccurring dream,this is the third or fourth time i ve had this weird unsettling dream the details of the previous times are fuzzy but this time was so vivid i m calling it the sesame street parade i know it sounds silly but hear me out and for the record i have never been afraid of the sesame street characters at all basically i start out walking on this path full of creatures that look like something out of sesame street things are bright and friendly at first but they slowly get darker and more unsettling as i walk i start to feel eyes on me when i turn around the creatures are staring dead into me and seem to be following far behind me i don t feel scared really but definitely weirded out as if i ve been here many times and i m used to it i ve learned that the creatures stay pretty tame when walking with multiple people or if i never look back at them no matter how much i want to it always ends with me making it back to my house going to my parent s bedroom where my family members are waiting for me and quickly locking the door behind me to keep the creatures out it s always dark outside and shadowy figures of these creatures can be seen lurking outside the windows sometimes coming closer and staring at us again we all seem to be used to this and know not to look back at them for too long the creature who comes up to the window most often is a raggedy zombified version of big bird with bloodshot eyes as funny as it sounds it s pretty frightening to have a usually friendly foot tall creature staring into your soul a bonus detail of this dream is that my old dog was in the room this time it s been quite a long time since he came to visit me in my dreams so it was comforting 
538,why are train tracks almost always in my dreams?,train tracks and trains to go along with them almost always appear in my dreams i have an irrational fear of trains but the train tracks show up in dreams as well as nightmares just the other day i had a completely non nightmare dream where i was a fox and i had to cross through an active train yard the trains are almost always freight trains i used to live in a canadian province that has a lot of freight trains so i suppose they could be a symbol of nostalgia it s confusing because they ll appear in dreams no matter how relevant to the plot they actually are 
539,dream about mother going insane after zombie infection,hey first time posting and just joined i don t usually have nightmares or just don t remember them this one involved my being at home in a house and neighbourhood that did not look like mine at all the house was bigger built of wood but in a suburban area the zombie apocalypse had happened but not destroyed life like in the movies we had somehow managed to stay organized and manage it as a larger society but there were still random stragglers walking around it s summer and daytime i m tending to the garden up front then my brother screams a zombie has attacked him he s bitten and is sick his skin colour is changing we quarantine him and he survives but remains weak i then tell the family to search the house as i search i find zombies and lots of doors and windows poorly shut or locked i try to lock them but some keep failing to then my mom gets attacked she doesn t get bitten but zombie blood contaminates her she begins to get sick her skin changes colour she seems to age before my eyes as if her body is nearing death but my cries and pleading for her not to leave us works and she fights it off i feel relief and we go watch a movie in the living room after i ve checked all the doors and windows everything looks alright while we watch the movie but then i notice extremely strange behaviour on my mom s part she hands me what looks like a piece of skin brown pigmented skin the skin of an older woman she says here have some chocolate i take it and look up at her face she s been mutilating herself she cut off an eyelid it s at this moment that i realize that she may not be a typical zombie but that the sickness has made her go insane she mutilates herself and displays joy at doing it no pain or distress are expressed she kisses me then i wake up i m wondering what such a dream could mean it s a very rare occurrence i m convinced my brain body must be communicating something thoughts please and thanks 
540,disturbing set of dreams bothering me,was not too sure where else to post this but this has been bothering me for a week or so now backstory for years i had have the same ish dream started with me flying or in this same airport and it always led to the same giant warship i had be flying around it sometimes bad things happen sometimes not very s action movie feel to it about a week ago i had a dream that started much the same way except the warship was just destroyed it was off in the distance and i had to run while the rest of the stuff around it was exploding then i was flying off and a fire breathing jester kept trying to take me out he ended up being kicked away and i was flying off just watching this giant sea of burnt out destroyed warship and warship accessories a few days later the flying dream started off quite similar but there was no warship anymore it was around and above a cartoon nintendo style village and a cartoon pelican was making jokes etc it was a really different vibe even if it started the same way i was also using a contraption to fly not doing it myself either i woke up and ever since i have had this kind of weird feeling i know the warships not coming back the easy answer for this would be i left an abusive relationship and this is just my mind parceling that out i suppose i just had to get it off my chest because my dreams have never affected me like this or gotten to me so much i keep thinking about them

545,help: i have been having nightmares about sex with my brother,i know i know it is fucked for the past few months i have been having nightmares with the same context different surroundings in each of these dreams i am having intercourse with my partner in waking life during the sexual encounter i decide that i do not want to partake and my partner becomes more forceful then turns into my older brother some background no i have not had some twisted or traumatic experience with my older brother in waking life as a matter of fact i have a great relationship with my older brother and my older brother is and has always been quite gay into dudes as far as the relationship dynamic with my older brother he has always been quite shy and withdrawn leading me to sometimes feel like the older sister we did sometimes get into physical altercations as kids do my partner and i used to also get into physical altercations when we were both struggling with addiction since getting sober we have gone on to have a healthy relationship my and i must emphasize gay older brother and i shared a room growing up until we were me and him our biggest issue sharing a room was arguing over whose side of the room was messier and arguing over what was on the tv other than that it was no different from sharing a room with a sister or a dorm with another female there were no awkward moments sexually sexually my partner sometimes likes me to take the dominant role and all that entails while i am open minded and sometimes like taking the lead and doing certain stuff some of what my partner says during these interactions leads me to think that he has some suppressed fantasies with men it does make me feel uncomfortable sometimes and i ca not help but question whether or not that has a tie in with my gay brother there are some days where i do not want to have sex with my partner at all but it happens anyways because i do not want him to get upset i ca not help but wonder if these interactions are causing some sort of suppressed rift in my feelings towards my partner i still love my partner but the feelings on my end are starting to grow more platonic in nature back to the nightmares in each of these nightmares i feel a lot of disgust and fear i have looked into the experience of others having similar dreams and they do not mention having such a level of disgust in their dream only in waking life in these dreams i am doing everything i can to get the fuck away from my brother who is pestering me i am trying to seek help from someone anyone who could get me out of the situation and separate us i must reiterate that this is laughably not at all what my reality has ever been in waking life it really makes me feel awful for anyone who has been in such a situation in the beginning of these dreams as i mentioned earlier an example from the other night the other night i dreamt that i was in my childhood room which i shared with my brother my partner was there and he initiated a sexual interaction i was hesitant but went along with it until i started to feel a little too reluctant a similar level of reluctantance as i sometimes feel in waking life then i looked up and to my utter abhorrance my partner was no longer my partner but instead my brother who began pestering me questioning why i was so unwilling before making more forceful initiations i ran downstairs and was chased outside my naked brother stopped at the door to put on clothes while i started screaming and banging on my neighbors door they would not let me in and so i broke in through a window and locked myself in their house my neighbor and childhood friend were cowarding in the corner while on the phone with because they had heard my screams i began locking all the windows and doors i did not want to explain the gross situation to my neighbors my brother who had now turned back into my partner was now going around the house banging on the doors and trying to gain entry while telling me to calm down and just come home i have had a lot of similar dreams to this and it has been going on for the past few months i do not know the meaning behind these dreams maybe it is that i sometimes want a platonic relationship with my partner and as the friendzone saying goes i love him but i love him like a brother i still do at times have sexual feelings towards my partner as one should but for what i do feel sexually these dreams nightmares only further extinguish i hate the thought of breaking up over this considering how much we have managed to overcome and how close we have gotten over the past years living together as a couple but i do not even know remaining like this and simply setting boundaries would be the fair thing for either of us i had like if there were a way to rekindle things i have tried talking to him about my situation here he knew that i was having nightmares that were causing me to grow more distant this morning he was upset and interrogated me on the matter he wanted to know what kind of nightmares could be upsetting me that much he thought that it was the standard dreams of infidelity so he went on a rant that i was punishing him for something he did in my dreams i explained that it was nothing like that and that i did not want to talk about it because it was disgusting he still believed that he must have done something in my dreams that i was punishing him for so i finally came clean and said the thing that you are doing in my dreams is you are turning into my brother i feel that there is a lot more i need to discuss with him on the matter but whenever i bring up how i feel he goes into a mode of self deprecation it is because i am ugly you do not love me or you do not find me attractive anymore is that it but the truth is i find him quite attractive and i do love him i just do not feel sexually compatible with him anymore that being said maybe suppressing these feelings is leading to the nightmares i am honestly not sure but i am hoping discussing them and potentially finding out the cause might help me stop having these nightmares all together

570,i had a weird dream last night,i had a really weird dream last night but i guess you could say it is more of a nightmare tbh while i was scared of it in the moment now i am mostly just confused and intrigued as to what it means the beginning of the dream does not really matter it started out like your typical dream it seemed normal but nothing was quite right like how most dreams are at some point i was walking through my house and all the lights were off i had a flashlight and my father was standing over by the light switch but he had not turned any lights on yet i walk up to the wall and when i look to the top of it where it is supposed to meet the ceiling there is a gap the gap is like ft wide and it spans the whole length of the wall somehow not quite sure how i climb up the wall to look through the gap when i shine my flashlight through i see another room that logically should not be there since this wall is an exterior wall to my house inside the room there are two tall humanoid creatures they are tall enough to see over the gap just standing we are talking ft they have pale yellowish skin and elongated skulls kinda like the stereotypical aliens you see in media the worst part is though they have human eyes the creature standing closest to me turns and looks me in the eyes when it does it starts screaming and i notice that it is mouth is oddly diamond shaped the scream is not human it sounds more like metal scraping against metal and as i hear the scream i feel myself being lifted up into the air i yell at my dad to turn the lights on but before he can do that i hear in my brain you are not supposed to be here then i wake up i did not scream but i was breathing heavily and my heart was pounding i looked over at the clock and saw it was am somehow i knew that the creatures were called sowers and for those of you who do not know what that means it is a person who plants something and it is used in several metaphors in the bible two things i noticed was that my body was oddly hot so much so that i was sweating despite my window being open it is winter rn so like f in my room the other thing i noticed was that although my room was completely dark it felt like there were lights on behind my eyes they were so bright i almost could not see i do not know how else to describe it i sat there for a few minutes trying to calm down but the dream just would not leave my head so i grabbed my phone and quickly wrote it down in my notes app before going back to sleep the attached image is what i wrote i have no idea what this dream means but it could be nothing i have chronic nightmares one almost every night and they are notorious for being extremely detailed and extremely creepy but idk this one just stood out to me it felt more like a vision than a dream if anyone who reads this has any ideas i am all ears and if anyone wants to hear about more of my creepy dreams i have plenty to share tl dr i had a weird dream about some creatures called the sowers who told me you are not supposed to be here
571,i beat my 'wet' dream,you know those dreams when you are looking for a toilet or actually pee in your dream and you wake up well wet or barely make it to the toilet on time i actually is urvived on of those in my dream my mom a friend and i stopped at a parking lot i had to pee so walked to the back of the parking lot and peed against the wall then my dream became unclear was inside a building for a while started walking down a street to end up walking in a forest next to a little stream yeah my brain is really trying to tell me something it is not until i meet up with people i barely know irl who started up a barbecue next to the stream i finally wake up dry not a single drop i even layed there a couple of minutes thinking of the dream before i got up and walked to the toilet so yeah although from what i remember i peed early on in my dream i kept it dry and i am dang proud of it to 
572,i require a dream wizard to explain this dream to me,so it started off normal right i was working in a gun store and a dude came in talking about this sick game i was offered a chane to play a game and i accepted and i got to this location and there was a lot of people i didn t know but they all were like an individual they didn t act like dreambots and turned out this wasn t a game but a trap and we all got teleported to rooms we had to escape from and each time you escaped the room rooms were connected to another room and turned out the way to leave that room was to solve the room together but the final lock on all the rooms was a blood sacrifice for some reason because we solved the riddle so you had to kill each other and the winner would go into a next room and repeat i ended up making it through and these fights were fights i mean detailed and in all these rooms there was like a strobe outside but turned out that the strobe was the moon and the sun passing because the person i was with in that room recorded it on their phone and slowed it down meaning time was different in this place and then i got to the last room and i met the guy who offered me the chance to come but it wasn t a man it turned out to be a otherworld being thing and it was all like congratulations blah blah and explained no one had died irl they just woke up and didn t deserve the prize and then gave me this like power up and told me i was free to go until next time and i just walked through the door and woke upweird thing is i m like a dream walker prob due to my native blood so i control my dreams a lot if i don t like something i change it if i die or fall i don t wake up i just respawn or start to fly if i wake up and i want to resume where i left off because i needed to go to the bathroom or something i just go back to sleep and resume i remember all my dreams and it s been like that since i was a kid i am always excited to sleep becausei do not know where i m going but i know there is the possibilty of an adventure but i wasn t in control this time
573,had a baby dream last night and it was terrifying,title says it all in my dream i had a baby girl with my current partner in the beginning we were so excited to be parents but i think my conscious sunk in or something because i realized holy shit this baby is here i am not ready for this what about all my future plans and it kept spiraling from there about what i would do about my baby like is it too late to put it up for adoption well what if i do this or that in order to do the plans i had set it was a wild panic and i do not really know what to make of it either it was just a silly dream or could it have deeper meanings 
574,i dreamt my husband murdered someone,this isn t anything new surprisingly we re newlyweds but for a long time now i keep getting dreams about him either cheating on me or somehow leading me to my death just to preface this he is an amazing man who has done nothing but be kind and loyal to me onto the dream my husband was driving us to my job in this new car he somehow found himself in possession of i was sitting in the seat right behind him we pulled up to my job and we sat in the car for a few minutes talking before i got out he then proceeds to tell me the most bone chilling thing this isn t my car and there s someone under your seat i was panicking as this man just told me there s a dead body under i seat i was sitting on he was looking at me with a sinister smile awaiting my response to what he said i knew i had to leave but i didn t want him to get suspicious of me where are we going to hide it i asked him he proceeded to tell me that he had that covered but he wanted me to throw out any loose items in the car i began grabbing things and throwing them into a deep ditch to the side of my job he then pulls off to dispose of the body i didn t know what to do other than contact the police when i went to call them their line was down i was frantic and went to go tell my manager but then i saw my husband walking towards me i tried to compose myself and he passed me i ended up finding a note on the ground telling me how this all came to be turns out he had stolen that car and pretended to be a taxi driver when a young woman entered the vehicle he attempted to seduce her he refused immediately since she was also married he became furious and killed her by repeated blows to the head he was out of sight so i saw this as my chance to reach my boss i quickly ran over to his and alerted him of everything he thought i was joking but i demanded that he call the cops to see if it would possibly work for him it worked and the police had began to make their way over to my job i went back to my desk where my husband was waiting for me he began asking me things trying to figure out if i had told on him he told me to kill him but i refused and told him i couldn t just let him get away with that bingo he caught me he now knew that i did in fact call the police on him he was internally furious but was outwardly calm almost scarily calm he approached me and put his hands on my shoulders he then began whispering in my ear threats on my life and the lives of other people i knew and loved he never loosened his grip on me tightening it instead the cops never arrivedand then i woke up
575,truth about dreams,dreams are affected by your location on earth depending on where you lay you head determines the dreams you get because you were probably doing something there in a past life anyway somebody please help me yeah it is cool i get to visit other realms and talk to people and creatures but apparently chucky has some curse over the government assistance apartment i stay in and i keep visiting his realm in my same apartment and it is scary as shit i also had a worm and snake crawl on top top of me the snake actually bit my spirit essence and the worm jump in my body ca not explain that part i also saw a human horse on the computer giving me a warning to get out this realm which was once me in a past life for a brief second but after that second was over whatever was torturing me took control and told me her name with galactic echo to her voice but basically everyone was warning me to get out there demonic realm 
576,black mirror dream,yoo so i had a dream that i was looking in a class or something and we were each looking for something and i found a black mirror one used for scrying it was a big mirror the size of a large painting the only thing that it reflected was me with white eyes and an open rd eye almost like if i was possessedish it was just starring when i looked into it something happened that made me panic and in turn the mirror fell ontop of me but didn t break idk it felt like a blessing but my fear kicked into gear and kept me from receiving it any idea what it would mean 
577,another “life” / reality?,hey everyone so i m going to start this off by saying i don t consider my self a full blown conspiracy theorist i just like to keep my mind open to any and all possibilities and i do this with most aspects of my life but anyways today when i woke up i just felt different i had a dream but this wasn t like anything i ve ever experienced dream wise it was my life playing out at a insane speed kind of picking parts of things i had done in the past but they were slightly different something wasn t right about everything that happened certain details or things that happened in real life were different in this dream but all morning i ve been slowly recalling things from the dream and how they differ from what i experienced when i was living those moments awake i d like to add i just have a weird like vibe i m feeling while i m remembering these dream things and life things so i just was wondering if anyone has experienced something similar or the same and what your take on this is possibly another reality just my mind playing tricks i don t know what to think honestly 
578,what does it mean,so i ve had a reoccurring dream i wouldn t call it a nightmare but it s not exactly a happy dancing on clouds dream either essentially all the dream is me crawling thru a tight tube that s completely black and all i can see is a light at the end and all i can hear are just people laughing and ridiculing me for everything etc dealt with bullying and all that my entire life anyway once i get to the end and get out of the tunnel my girlfriend is standing there and the second i see her all the other noises from everyone and everything completely stop i ve had this dream about times now and it gets more detailed every time i ve been with my girlfriend for months and the dream is in first person if that could help at all what could this mean i m very confused 
579,idk if it counts as dreams?,sometimes i have these like half asleep hallucinations that something scary is happening in my room i do not know how to describe them but a few times i ve been kinda sleeping then i see a spider in my room i scream and run out the door in my sleep then i wake up and check if the really was spider there never is this only happens at night apart from last week when i was taking a nap after being up literally all night i saw blood dripping from the ceiling right above me i felt and saw it in my hand and i ran to my dad in hysterics and didn t realize it was a dream hallucination until i came back to my room amp saw the ceiling and there was no blood a woman died in the apartment across from me by suspected murder so i think this is what it was caused by the scariest one i ve had a few other examples are that i ve seen a person in my bed a demon going into a portal and my room covered in spiders hanging from the ceiling it happens more often if i m having trouble sleeping like when i m trying to sleep earlier than normal and i almost always end up running out or to the door i am sure it s caused by anxiety but i ve never heard of anyone else suffering from this it s not like sleep paralysis anyone know if there s a name for it 
580,goat heads,last night i dreamt that i kept finding dismembered goats in my house i would turn a corner and there would be the lower portion of a leg or two with the hooves attached next to a head sometimes the head was intact and sometimes it was pieces i don t usually have dreams this gorey or graphic and why goats of all things 
581,question if anyone’s experienced this,not sure where to post this but last night i had a dream that my grandma who passed in december visited me i ve been having a hard time processing her death so this was very welcome and it was a pleasant visit now it s important to note that i m nearly always aware that i m dreaming i was in this case and often control my dreams but only in very minor ways like i can t shift the direction of my dream easily but more than that it s rare and i should also note i m not religious nor do i have an easy time believing in the supernatural in my dream my grandma showed me what her and my aunt neve her sister who passed two weeks prior were seeing and it was beautiful and i ve never felt more joy unfortunately though she went on to tell me that i ll pass on with her during my upcoming surgery so my questions is has anyone ever experienced this and not died i only ever hear of the ones where they do but why would the inverse be news i guess sorry if this is the wrong r to post this to 
582,"i returned to a fictional place in a dream for a second time, two whole months after dreaming about it for the first time.",about two months ago i dreamed about going to a certain place to fix my bicycle the one that i use in real life that bicycle place in the dream was run by someone that i am not familiar with but in the dream i sorta knew who he was and he was quite popular receiving a lot of clients on daily basis the location of his place was also sorta weird he worked in a small shack that was essentially placed on the premises of a children is school yard the entire dream was set in an area that i have never been to but it still looked oddly familiar as if the dream is assets were taken from places that i go to in real life if that makes any sense that was the first time i dreamed about that place and there was not a lot going on in it anyway a few days ago i had another dream and to my unimaginable surprise i returned to the same damn place that same liminal looking school yard same shack and even the same person who owns that bicycle store i needed him to fix my bicycle again but this time my bicycle was almost a total wreck so i had to wait there for awhile until he finished working on it as he is busy working i take a look around seeing children running and playing in the yard seeing the sun up there in the sky it was a beautiful summer day but all of a sudden it just dawned on me i have already been here before it took me by such a surprise that i felt like somebody smacked me right in the face why the hell am i revisiting a place that i have indeed been to before but not in real life at that point i guess my consciousness could not really take it or understand it and i woke up it was not like scary or anything but still weird enough to trigger an end for the dream there is a good chance that this is the first time in my life in which i revisited a fictional place in a dream i do not recall anything similar to this ever happening to me in my dreams before i did have in the past multiple dreams about places that exist in real life but never fictional places like in this specific case 
583,"rubbed eye to achieve self-awareness, immediately woke up",so in the dream i was riding in the car with some of my friends from when i was in highschool but at our current ages and we were talking about video games at first but then i got this weird uncomfortable feeling in my eye that kept bothering me i started to grow suspicious and i said something like is not it crazy that we are hanging out still after all this time and i do not remember if anyone replied but i started touching one of my friends on the arm and he was like wtf are you doing and i said trying to see if this is real or not nothing happened at first but i started to rub at my eyes because of the discomfort and then i woke up i think it is really interesting because my dream self is usually really stupid and does not realize i am in a dream but this time i actually tried stuff to figure it out

592,i just had such an intense dream &amp; that i woke up crying.,i ve never felt a dream so intensely to be very honest and i think the reason for that is partly because i meditated right before i went to sleep i ve been wanting to do that for a long time and when i finally did it it was kind of an intense experience so this is what happened in my dream i was initially sleeping and then something woke me up which made the dream feel more realistic i go outside my room and i see my boyfriend getting really cozy with someone i freak the fuck out and suddenly i cannot breathe because i m so so angry i was still trying to catch my breath when i woke up and then i burst into tears now the weird part about this dream is i ve been having a hard time controlling my emotions keeping them in check or just have a grip on them when this scary characteristic of mine made it s way into my dreams it just scared the shit out of me like how ingrained does a thought have to be that you start dreaming about it all in all it was a weird experience but i m still looking forward to meditating before sleeping to see what else comes up so i can deal with it on a conscious level

601,the undertaker dream,i ll begin by saying i am not a writer i am only here because i recently met someone who after hearing a few of dreams suggested i share them on reddit so here i am at am on a monday also fortunately or unfortunately the dream goes on for longer then i can remember so i can only share the end i am travelling through london somewhere in the city centre in the early hours of morning it is either a friday or saturday i know this because the streets are buzzing with crowds of drunk people and music i am not alone a girl in a leopard fur coat and short black hair is holding my hand and dragging me through the crowds with purpose as her friend a blonde blurr follows behind me eventually we get to a side road that reassembles more of an allayway but opens up into a boxed carpark with one entrance and one exit the way we came in as we walk further into the carpark i notice only one other person a man standing in front of a car with its hood open he is wearing a long black almost leather looking coat that despite him being over foot reaches his knees paired with a wide brim open crown hat hence the name and title the undertaker the girl let is go of my hand and rushes toward the undertaker she does not recognise him but i do i had already heard the stories of what he was capable of and as those stories rush through my head i freeze in fear she approaches him taps his shoulder and begins to question him on his intentions he does not respond verbally or physically he also freezes i rush towards her and try to pull her away she turns to me and explains that this is her car and that he the undertaker should not be touching it i turn away back towards the way we came in search of her friend the blonde blurr for help by the time i turn back the undertaker is gone and fear takes over me again this time allowing me to take one step back she unphased proceeds to close the hood of her car and just as quickly as he vanished the undertaker reappears but this time with a light transparent fog around him he grabs her from behind and vanishes with her this time the fear reaches a new height and brings life to my legs i dash towards the sideroad i must have made atleast five strides before he re appears but this time in front of me he does not wait to be spoken to or speak a word to me he grabs me and we disappear when i awake i am in my own bed partly paralysed as if a drug was wearing off i try to sit up countless times managing to reach halfway before falling back each time i fail my heart rate intensifies suddenly a burst of erratic panicked voices shock my ears i look towards my feet where the voices are coming from what i see confirms this is a nightmare and not a dream my legs have been sawed off only a pool of blood remains and pass my bed is my wardrobe i can only see the side view of it and it is doors are open on the door itself is the source of the panicked voices from earlier four naked girls somehow infused with the door one on top of the other the full length of the door somehow these girls are d and d at the same time only there torso and above remain there torsos hanging out of the door like a sticker being peeled off each girl is erratically pointing at a corner of my room above my bed through everything they had not stopped shouting unfortunately there voices had merged together and became one inaudible noise i turn to where they are pointing i see nothing as i look back at them they are trying to alert me more franticaly however this time they are pointing in the opposite corner this time i ca not bring myself to look this time i decide to wake up the end i will say i had to write this twice because the stupid browser decided to close randomly and i learnt my first lesson write in notes first and copy it over because i bloody lost everything and feel like i put more effort in the first time please any comments are welcomed

603,i dreamed a whole visual novel from start to finish,dunno if this is right for this sub but i wanted to share it somewhereanyways this starts in a star wars esk setting where people just casually travel from planet to planet mc and a friend are in a party in a mansion in some planet but we are not invited and instead are trying to nick something from it i think i only remember us getting caught redhanded and having to run away by scaling the wall and jumping off following while walking away from the mansion that the friend loredumps that this is a world all messed up and inhabited only by women some of which were serving at the party and that most of the planet is uninhabitable looking at it in hindsight probably because of a war few men left and most of the planet is in ruins of what used to be a civilization until we end up running into a fully functional city where we are welcomed by one of the few men left the guy running the city with most other men left being his cronies who are happy to receive any men who will stay with them since they are in a shortage of guys what is not great in the long run if you are trying to keep a civilization going the city itself is again a futuristic esk setting filled with little robots and lots of neon screens helped being run by an ai the boss guy bragged about as well this boss guy also gives some big vibes of being one fitness gurus going on about how you have to read lots and work out lots to have a strong body and mind if you are going to stay and only mc does the friend goes home or something i do not know do not remember what happens to him but he does not show up again so he tells you you should pick up some books on your way to the new home amp anyways then we get into the actual dating sim part of the game where mc is taken to what will be his room from now on and introduced to a bunch of local girls in a college esk setting and has to choose one to interact with with most of them being overly interested in him since he is one of the few guys they have ever seen let alone one around their age with me ending up choosing to spend time with the quiet one later on learning she is getting bullied by some of the others and actually does not like the whole reading and working hard culture amp it is also at this point that the dream shifts fully from being a first person thing into full on about me playing a character in a visual novel with me reloading after messing things up with her and later on straight up saving and seeing dialogue options amp either way mc gets into a relationship with her and yada yada most of it is a blur except for the final part of the story mc gets to befriend one of the few local guys left not directly working for the boss guy and he sneaks mc out of the city for a tour trough the rest of what used to be the country seeing a bunch of ruins and post apocalyptic esk stuff and lore dumping about it as they go do not remember most of it what is a shame but when we get back boss guy catches us and scans mc and the friend seeing the items they have on the and where they have been and declares that we were not supposed to leave the city because something something history revisionism and stuff his people were not supposed to see so he is going to punish us at what point i see the options to accept it run fight or try to bargain choosing the latter after saving in case i mess up what causes mc to argue he did not know they were not allowed to leave the city since he was never told so so boss guy ends up resigning to that and letting mc go only ordering his cronie to kill the new friend and again i get the options to accept that try grab him and run away or ask for help with me again choosing the final one at what point the friend tries to run away and the cronie sets off after him but mc yells for the ai to help him what she does sending one of the little helping robots to neutralize the cronie turns out the ai does have a full on personality of her own and also likes mc how convenient so next i get the option to ask her to take down the boss guy what she does after a chase scene after him if i make mc claim he loves her amp after what i get a full on epilogue scene with mc as the new boss the ai and the girl i choose older and waiting for a child ofc and that new friend all happy with the mc amp and i get woken up by my dog barking a bit after that with the last part of the dream being me going even harder on th wall breaking straight up googling other scenes and routes with the different girls to see if they were any different amp well this was an experience turns out dream me can do worldbuilding and write a full fledged story

607,dream from a while ago i wrote down,i get on the bus after exiting a weirdly familiar school building and apparently i forgot something i leave my bag on the bus but then i get back and the bus is driving away so i get on a random bus the only person i recognize is person from missed bus why was she on this bus anyways oh crap he passed my neighborhood so i rush to the front of the bus to ask if he goes to my neighborhood the driver says he just goes anywhere so then we re on the way to my house without me having to tell him directions also the bus turned into a car and theres no more students we approach my house but he s not stopping so i jump out into the random pile of snow by the house and go inside brother did something but i cant remember what it was now mom shows us random papers and then asks us what should we do so then i open this green little notebook i have that barely had anything written on it the only thing i remember reading rn is work more well or something like that then i think i close the book and said we should get dunkin donuts which is the only part that kinda makes sense because i was craving dunkin at that time 
608,had a dream i was talking to a momma eagle,i knew this eagle and it had recently hatched babies in a nest where i helped them have by placing their nest in a very high tower with a roof on top i went to visit the eagle and her family and we chilled out until the babies went back to sleep and cuddled under her my dog was there too protecting and providing warmth i then come down and somehow the dream changes a bit and i am able to have a conversation with the eagle and i tell her it was a privallege to have been in the nest with her and the babies she says of course and maybe my friend is name can come too next time i said maybe but he needs to be ready to meet the family slowly to not scare the babies i then woke up the eagle is voice sounded similar to my wife is and my friend and i have not gotten to hang out in months so weird that i had to come here to see if anyone could interpret it 
609,"what dose it mean or how you explain when you dream about things, events, places and then you see it in real life?",i used to get this a lot when i was younger but rare in recent years i do not tell people about it because they wo not take me seriously or just call me a liar saw many big events that happened later one of them i think happened after years small things liking watching a certain movie while eating certain food my seat location everything exactly like in my dream is there any name for this according to our faith it is a good thing i am a sinner wo not lie but still a believer thx
610,i have a two part question if anyone has any answers! (languages in dreams and flying in dreams),im an english speaker but i studied italian a for four non consecutive years and have a basic italian skillset no where near fluent but i can make myself understood in simple conversations i ve noticed that every now and then i find myself and others speaking fluent italian in my dreams and i can clearly understand it as if i were fluent why might this be happening and is this normal next i have super vivid dreams and i sometimes fall into lucid dreams and i try to fly but when this happens i just can t seem to stay up in flight for very long more like far leaps or gliding through the sky unless i close my eyes in the dream does anyone else have this problem and is there something i can do to make it so this doesn t happen 
611,what does it mean when you dream that you don’t know what a gender identity is??,a few days ago i had a lucid dream where i ask a shadow what my gender identity was and they said they don t know and that know one have told them what a gender identity is i have been trying to figure out what my gender is so this was very confusing what d où y all think this means 
612,i think someone is visiting me while i'm sleeping,hi i am valeria english is not my first language so my apologies if there is a ortographic mistake in my story i am currently years old so this has been following me for more than years since i was years old i used to have this dream about someone who came to my bedroom and sat at the border of my bed i could not what he looked like in my dreams i only remember seeing two eyes staring at me and a black shadow surrounded him now looking back to this dream now the only thing i used to see was his eyes he used to kiss me gently in my bed at that time i thought it was just a dream however it was very vivid that dream repeated at least times and then stopped happening years ago i traveled to a town for work it was my first time being alone in a hotel i was very tired when i slept that night i felt the presence of someone in my bedroom someone was hugging me while i was sleeping it was so vivid then he started kissing me and touching me it was not rude after this he got up of the bed i remember this so clearly and he practically run of my bedroom i could not see what he looked like i wanted to follow him but i felt like something heavy was at my body and i could not move i blinked and i was lying in my bed the bed looked like it have been moved and i was unsure if this was only a dream or if was real i was really frightened of someone had broken into my room i checked the bedroom is bolt and it was ok i did not sleep well after that dream the last month i had the same dream someone hugging me and then kissing me etc but i decided to touched his back and it was not there i mean i could touch his face and his hair but when i was trying to touch other things apart from that it was not there like he could not have a physical body or a definite shape apart from his face then i saw him running of my bedroom in form of a black shadow of a tall male maybe this is only a dream and it is not actually happening i want to know if someone has experienced something like this before or are experiencing i always have the feeling of lethargy on my body when i am experiencing this

620,drøm error?,did anyone experience what seems to be an error in a dream something that was not supposed to happen and that destroyed the dream i had this just now and it feels like i experienced a program error that made the dream go wild and i ended waking up breathing heavily here is the dream i was in my car driving somewhere together with my wife it was pretty realistic and i could see the landscape and even remember some road signs it was in the countryside and august like weather sunny hot and beautiful although a bit dry we were late for where we were supposed to be but not a huge problem we did not know the way and discussed where to turn and so on no gps for some reason we passed a sign pointing to a town called something quite short around letters which also had a drawing which i found significant something in between an air sock and a hot air balloon a bit blurry with broad white and red stripes it seemed that we had to do a long detour in order to get to our destination so we tried what looked like a shortcut a small road that was not paved and looked unofficial after driving through some scattered trees it opened up into a field where there was cattle and a tourist here and there some natural park we carried on even though we had the feeling that we were not supposed to drive there and maybe even should pay for being there at some point there was not a road anymore and the car could not go further luckily i had my bicycle and my wife sat behind as i continued further on it went well an everything was nice even uphill i enjoyed how well the bicycle was going then we came to a fence it was locked but we examined it a bit and found out that we could squeeze through and get the bicycle with us on the other side we found ourselves standing by a regular road it was at a degrees turn and slowly it dawned on us that we had been there not long ago when we were driving by car we continue and we see the same odd sign with the wind sock balloon and we pass by some something buildings named some person is last name plus resistance factory modstandsfabrik in danish and here it goes crazy suddenly i see fast changing pictures in my mind many pictures new pictures pop up in front and the older ones fade to the background and the sides so that they are still partly visible they change so fast that i can see what is on most of them but some of them are there too short time for me to understand what is on them i guess around pictures per second but not sure all photos look like they were taken in something people machines buildings statues and maybe newspaper pages also historical photos i begin to wake up and i feel my eyes moving from side to side and are a bit sore i try to hold on because i find it interesting but i am almost out of breath in reality like i just ran very fast and cannot help waking up on my way to waking up i jump back to where i am driving the bicycle with my wife and its summer and cosy and nice then i am awake i wonder what this resistance factory was all about and this explosion of images and why was i breathing so heavily it was not really scary or chocking if felt like something that was an error in the dream but on the other hand there was some connection in that we saw this road sign and the factory had a name and it was not random images any ideas or similar experiences

624,story about a dream my roommate had., i hope this does not break any kind of rules for the subreddit because only the end of it is about the dream directly i just wanted to give all needed info so today i was tryna annoy my roommate by giving him hints about him being in a coma when sending him a message i put something like sir you have been sleeping for years and your wife is dying she wants to talk to you one last time into the middle of the text for no reason or with no context i was making some jokes about this here and there throughout the entire day when he was half asleep i was silently talking to him for minutes like if i was the doctor trying to wake him up i made up some stories and stuff about how the doctor knew him before he got into the coma at and how he was an amazing person i also told him about how the doctor promised him to one day go to space with him together but sadly it is only possible with today is technology which he did not get to experience at the end i was literally crying i have no idea how i cried so easily on command maybe my story was a bit too sad or am i secretly good at something after that he totally fell asleep and woke up like one or half an hour later from a weird dream he did not remember anything about what i said he just told me about the dream he was in a hospital with a doctor who had short black hair he was on a hospital bed in a room with no windows only seeing the man and some kind of light he also remembered something about the man saying he would have to kill him if he did not woke up when talking to him i talked about how i would have had to take him off the thing is that kept him alive i was instantly surprised especially because he said for some time he actually questioned if what happened was real after that i said sorry and stuff and made another joke about the thing being real because i am an awful person and i should rot in hell then he told me so i am gonna die anyways weird considering at the very end of my story the doctor have moved on and i now actually me told him about me only being something in his dream based on the memories voice and personality of the doctor and told him once he falls asleep this dream would end together with his life pretty creepy story i would probably not forget this hope you had fun reading it if you see this

626,dream about astroprojecting,i had a very odd dream last night which involved me leaving my body and entering my old middle school it seems that in this dream i couldn t interact with the world around me unless i had a feeling of intent or meaning behind it similar to how a ghost would so i went around knocking things over and pushing people around because it s pretty funny but there was a kid that saw me he told me to stop and that i had died the night before because of an overdose i had taken one extra pill of my medication before going to bed he grabbed me and in my mind i was sure that i was going to disappear or go wherever you go when you die and at that moment i heard my heartbeat getting louder and louder until i woke up

632,"""stuck in a loop"" dream",has anyone ever dreamed you woke up but you did not and then your dream starts looping as if you have woken up again but you still have not i have only had this kind of dream a handful of times in my life and every time it is horrifying i just woke from one after taking a hours nap on the couch and i am shaking as i type this would love if someone with similar experiences wanted to talk with me about this at first your eyes are just heavy and you are trying to open them but you ca not you keep seeing the same image that you would see if you woke up for real for me it was my foot covered in a blanket my cat and my electric fireplace which is on you try to move it is really hard but eventually after a few loops of closing your eyes and starting over you maybe manage to move a leg and you are like great i am awake for real i felt my foot hit the floor nope i went through dozens maybe even more than a hundred loops each time i could move a little more usually my eyes were very hard to open and once i got them open a little i knew that things would reset if i tried to close and open them again after actually getting off the couch i threw myself off and bashed my shoulder into my living room table over and over i felt it every time i started getting up and walking around sometimes i made it further than others finally i started being able to see more of my house i felt like i was jumping through different realities in one our kitchen was beautiful and recently redone and also much larger in another my parents lived in my house with me they came running down when i started screaming for help in every successive loop after i first started yelling i kept going kept calling for help it started out as just a croak but then kept getting progressively louder until i was yelling every time in one loop my dad was watching tv on the opposite when i woke up he was started by my pleading for help and kept asking me what was wrong i think this was the last one before i got up for real i finally woke up just now i am exhausted my brain feels wrung out 
633,having dreams about traumatic events,normally my dreams are already pretty traumatic mostly when i am pmsing but i have recently started taking an ssri and they seem to be a lot more frequent just last night i had the same dream multiple times very slight differences where i was at a hospital with my brother and it had multiple shootings in some of the dreams he got shot but in others it was mostly strangers or no one the other night i had a dream that my dogs got out of the house and i found out that the vet decided to put all of them down for no particular reason i am unsure why but that dream had more of an impact on me than the others i was sobbing uncontrollably for hours and could actually feel the pain in my heart a week or ago i had a dream that i went to a private all girls school where the teachers forced us to have sex with them i have never went to a private school or an all girls school and i have never had negative experiences like that with a teacher so it was kind of weird 
634,i've spent a decade visiting people in their dreams and making sure they die peacefully.,hey guys i am turning soon and ever since i was i have had dreams of being sent to someone and making sure they die peacefully and not in pain they have all been very graphic and felt very real and i could feel smell everything and still remember them to this day each one of these dreams itd be someone who was going through an incredibly traumatic death like their limbs have been cut off in combat or their dad committed suicide people being burnt alive mostly people dying during wars sometimes i dream i am the person dying and i feel the pain of being stabbed or being shot but i know myself that i will die peacefully at my desk while writing something i do not know if it is a manifestation of schizophrenia but i wish these dreams will stop especially since my mum has been diagnosed with terminal illness and i always hear god knocking on the door and i always tell him its too soon the first dream was a woman being burnt alive by a man and i had to watch her going away because i was just helplesly hovering over her she said she wanted me there because she wanted someone to know what had happened to her after he left she was still alive and asked me to make sure her case gets solved it was an asian woman and she died in a rural southern state and that is all i remember the most traumatic one was being stationed in thailand during a civil war and this man with infected decapitated wounds was dying and he knew he was going to die right there he spent his last minutes telling me about my future and we were joking and laughing and i just held him close and he left during a deep sleep the most recent one was a man in afghanistan who committed suicide i joined him and his daughter on a trek up the mountains and had to convince him not to do it i left when he committed suicide and joined his daughter up to the point she told her younger siblings up until i had the faith to know she will be fine i am your average mid s yopro who is obsessed with skincare and makeup and preoccupied with dating but as a kid i always dreamt about being part of doctors without borders and maybe that is why my dreams are presenting like this however i have given up on that career i do not know if i have a mental disorder but i do believe in a spiritual world mainly because of how vivid my dreams are i guess the main thing to take away from this is that noone ever truly dies alone maybe god assigns jobs to living people like myself and sends them to others to make sure they die peacefully and make it home 
635,educational institutes as the backdrop.,been having a string of dreams wherein the backdrop invariably turns out to be either a school or a college or a university that i have been at the dream seems to be fast paced like i am moving through the corridors or the classrooms in search of something or i have retrieved the object and i am on my way to hand it over to a person but i tend to miss the destination of the meet and have to go about the whole route in anxious search again is there any way to interpret this has anyone else been through this ps i have graduated college and have not visited or been to any of my educational institutes for the past six years now

638,does my recurring romance dream have meaning?,hi everyone so for maybe years i ve f been having romantic dreams of the same guy i knew in high school over and over again we had classes together and would talk there but weren t ever super close although we had really easy conversations and now i haven t seen him at all since graduation years ago the dreams are different flavors but all with the same tone of romance they re also close to lucid dreams the kind where it feels like i m living life right there in that moment i m wondering what y all might think this means if anything do you believe in the spiritual connection are we connected in some cosmic way does this mean he might also be having dreams about me in this way too if there is such a thing should i do anything about the dreams i m having or just leave them be i like having them honestly so i don t want to get rid of them but i m curious what everyone thinks as i don t know a lot about this stuff and tbh i feel connected to him now even if none of it means anything so i just idk i m curious

641,23.01.29: my car key &amp; remote was also opening a nearby car, short dream not sure how to interpret it i have a bmw and looked like i was observing as it was lifted up and getting some fluids changed when the oil change was done i walked outside to the parking lot to pick it up my oil change wo not be until may june since i barely drive so might be an indicator of timing but when i opened the trunk with the key remote both my bmw is trunk opened as well as the trunk of the audi next to it unexpected one or two other people came over to investigate with me we tried it again and it looked like the remote was unlocking both cars then i compared the keys and could see they had slightly different teeth cuts but when i took my bmw key to the door lock on the audi it unlocked the car too it seemed like the manufacturer was using security through obscurity giving us the perception that these keys were unique and impenetrable but really they were mostly duplicates and anyone paying attention could see that the keys are swappable on a side note my insurance is up for renewal and this year the replacement value of my vehicle actually increased from last year i was thinking it might actually be nice if it was totalled then i could buy a newer model with the cash maybe a premonition that my bmw will be stolen 
642,has anyone of you dreamed about a film that does not exist?,i have dremed abaut film is before but recently i found ot that most of the films i remember are dreams for example i dreamed about kid running away from home by a train it was so detailed i thought of it today because i wanted to watch it again i remember everything about the film but not how i watched it laik if it was on my phone or something and ther would not be a reason for not to be on google since it was a very recent film like year ago 
643,a dream or something else?,i don t know if something like this has happened to anyone it s been awhile since the last time it happened to me i woke up in the middle of the night with a sense of dread like i wasn t alone in my room and then i had something like tunnel vision as if i was being sucked and then i heard a muffled scream when this happens to me i stay still scared to move a muscle and debate on either turn on the light and go to bring my dog to sleep with me or pretend like nothing happened and keep sleeping i m always scared to turn on the light because in some dreams the lamp is dead and when that happens i know that whatever that is with me is aware of me and my movement and knows that the light brings me peace and makes me feel safe and it doesn t want that i ended up turning the light on and brought my dog to sleep with me and i guess i ended up falling asleep i was lucky that what happened was short normally it last longer and it fucking terrifies me when i woke up i was unsure if i indeed turned the light on and went to get my dog but when i saw my dog on the carpet it downed on me that i was awake back then i don t know why it happens i just hate it
644,dream about getting shot by a stranger,hey all i just found this subreddit and wanted to mention a weird dream i had a few months ago but first some facts about me i am a young gamer who lives in the uk and am housebound due to severe anxiety anyway in this dream i do not know why but i was being pursued by a man with a handgun a situation both very rare in the uk and one i doubt i had ever find myself in anyway i attempted to flee and managed to jump over a few fences but he quickly caught up with me i then heard and felt at least two gunshots hit me in the back maybe more i fell to the ground and i saw blood appear over my vision and the words game over like i was in a video game i woke up afterwards and thought that was very weird never had a dream before and never had another dream like it i do play video games but i have not played any games that involved seeing a game over screen in years so i found this to be quite a peculiar dream nightmare hybrid 
645,videos and photos of my deceased soulmate (reoccurring character),this dream is messy because it clearly overlapped with another one so its hard to write down without making it sound like nonsense i am going to write them both down in one go my dream starts with me being very young like and we needing to go to a flea market in the kreade an old community centre we used to go to especially for the flea markets my sisters and i were angry at my mom because we arrived at pm instead of the usual am we went looking for toys and cameras and i found a silver sony one with super zoom and an extendable flash that is way cool like this thing could be extended up to a metre totally useless in hindsight it was not digital though which was weird because the lady at the stall told me the wi fi ones were more expensive did not have those in i was also interested in an unmarked film camera with a boxy design that reminded me of a canon range finder i personally own now that i think about it only it had weirdly digital features like it was made in the s but with s features it was weird i found a camera bag filled with unused film both and i remember being surprised finding it like it was under my bed or something then my soulmate pretty much showed up and the surrounding dream seemed to dissolve in to a blur this is where the transition happened between dreams we hanged outside where the kids used to play basket ball and near the skateboard ramps she was a japanese girl with short blackish brown hair she was like too and was wearing baggy pants with a red hoody with a yellow shirt underneath we hugged and kissed a bit and then she wanted me to take photos with the new camera i told her i could not because i did not have film then she said to use my phone which i remembered could capture video but it was not my old nokia i grabbed it was a smartphone and i did not see myself taking the footage instead my dream cuts again this time to me showing my mom and another lady my photos on another phone she basically looked the same but had different clothes on i had filmed her in the giant grass field next to the kreade and near some building i do not recognize i do recognize one of the photos being the wall near my school though in one photo my mom said but you can see her shoulder is hurt pointing to a bloody wound on her right shoulder then i woke up and as soon as i did my deceased soulmate who i channel told me she landed on her shoulder when the plane crashed and that she sent the dream to show herself more to me

659,multiple dreams of dying all night just now,i just woke up from the loudest explosion i ve ever heard and felt but it s been a chain of nightmares all night where i end up dying and that was the last one my first nightmare i had just graduated and was looking for a new home to move into and kept running into people i ve known all my life in real life but all along the way i had been discovering body parts buried in the ground i found a small story apartment i wanted to stay in and moved in simply by just walking in i noticed everything was already set up and ignore it and lay down on the bed and invite my boyfriend over and he decides to spent the night with me we re planning our night and i hear someone open my front door it s a man yelling saying he knows there s someone inside and he s not here to hurt anyone he just wants to sort things out i tell my bf to hide in the closet just to be safe in case anything happens and i ll be right back and i say i m so sorry i m in the bedroom which is unusual for me since i m a very safe person anyways i wait for the man to come toward the room he comes opens the door and tries to make sweet talk about how he never expected such a pretty face to take over his apartment anytime soon but that he wasn t ready to move out yet and just as i m about to call my boyfriend out the man walks over to lock the bedroom door and pulls a gun on me and he makes me undress myself for him and then r words me after it s done i look over to the closet door sobbing only to see nobody in there just my boyfriend over me telling me he s so sorry for doing this to me and the cold barrel meets my head and i m in my next dream second nightmare i was at a school event as a th grader all over again and we were having a scavenger hunt with the whole grade divided up into small groups and whoever won got some really cool prize after the entire scavenger hunt had passed my group realizes we re going to win we look for the teacher in charge of the scavenger hunt but we re on this complex amusement park like grounds that it s hard to regroup it took us so long to find our teacher that some other group had claimed the prize it was a concert on a small grassy lot with these super steep foot hills all around you couldn t climb over to watch we wait outside for the concert to be done but hear panic and everyone starts climbing these hills to enter people are climbing and falling back down because it s so hard to cling onto i make it over and hear screams behind me but just enter the show area and the music stops and you hear are screams and loud bangs i look behind me toward the hills and bodies around me start dropping dead and i m standing there frozen unable to process what to do then i fall over too clenching my head trying to figure out what could ve caused this massive headache only to look at my hands and see blood i lay on the grass staring up to see a shooting star only to see it land next to me and a ticking noise then i m transported to my next dream my third nightmare i was in a shopping plaza with my entire family mom dad brother and newborn baby sister they re grabbing smoothies and fruit cups meanwhile i check out a new clothing store that had just opened it s a dimly lit environment with only a few racks of clothing in the entire store i manage to look through them all and decide there s nothing of my interest i head out to see everyone in panic telling me to look for cover a man in a convertible points a small pistol at me and says not to worry he s got us covered but that there s a gun threat he says he s there to protect us and i hear someone call me across the smoothie shop counters and i m pulled over and i see my family hiding with the vendors my mom hands me my sister to tell her bye if anything happens i say nothing will happen but my brother decides it might be best to put my sister in a secure fruit drawer we set her inside and the man from earlier with a pistol asks if we know the gunman and i say no of course not and he smiles at me and tells me not to trust people so easily he kills everyone inside and points the gun at me and i m in my next dream my last nightmare i m shopping in a clearance section of a giant store and after a half hour of only finding things i go to check out i walk past some overalls for snow i ve been needing and check the price tag and it s way too much so i make a last trip around the store and hear a snobby girl talking about how half the people in here shouldn t even be inside because they can t afford it unlike herself i roll my eyes and continue walking as i m about to pay the snobby girl puts her warm jacket over my bare shoulders and i thank her because i have been so cold she looks me up and down and says what everuh and smacks on her gum and continues texting that made me realize she s just using me as a coat rack so she can use her phone i notice a small quiet girl forms in the line behind the snobby girl she s looking around panicked and twitchy i turn to tap my card to pay and i hear a loud thud and as i m turning around my left shoulder i m blinded and deafened on that side and i only process a

669,i had a dream about a girl driving a motorcycle with me in the back.,then we went to her place to have relations but she cut off my pee pee i went to the doctor to re attached it but it kept falling off 
670,i recently read ‘tipping point’ by malcom gladwell and it’s all i’ve been dreaming about. but the book is non fiction,i hadn t read a book in a while so i decided to pick up a random one from my shelf ever since i read tipping point a sociology book about social epidemics all of my dreams have been about it i am subconsciously obsessed with tipping point to the point where it is all my brain will let me think about when i sleep the book is non fiction though so i dream of percentages i keep dreaming about the stickiness factor and the rule gladwell organises people behind social epidemics into three categories the mavens and the connectors and the salesmen and they won t leave me alone i keep seeing crowds getting sorted and weird re enactments and diagrams of gladwell s arguments like one where one person in a colourless crowd turns into a colour and it s passed on and changed throughout the group and the further it is from the origin the more differently it changes and then the mavens and the salesmen and the connecters are highlighted to show their impact on the colour spread change or the rule and it s a crowd of people who are all green but then it adds more people and it all turns red because it s unorganised until it s split up and sorted into groups less than instead of just one big group of over and they re green and happy again i didn t even enjoy the book that much
671,my reflection killed me,disclamer i am someone who suffers from anxiety and depression and waking up from my sleeps because of my loud heart palpitations has become the norm to me anyway what happened is that i dreamt of being somewhere like a market where there was a lot of people and a lot of noise i had a headache and tried to go out from there but something was telling me to look back and so i did and that is when i saw her my reflection not in a mirror or something it was a humain being that looks like me but that have every trait that i despise in me it not our first encounter i have met her many times and i always fear her and runaway from her but this time it was different i stayed where i was as if i wanted her to hurt me and she looked sad something that i found strange she took a gun out and pointed it out to me and i just surrounded to her not a scream nor a tear i just stood there waiting for her and from all the noise that surrounded me i heard the gun shut and i saw the bullet in slow motion coming to me when it reached my forehead i felt it i felt the pain in my head and it started spreading all over my body once my whole body felt that pain i no longer heard the noise it was very peaceful the quietest it have ever been in two years i opened my eyes to find my self drowning in the bottom of the ocean i could see the light in the surface but i did not want to reach it i could not hear my heartbeats but i did not mind it it was so peaceful and i did not want to leave suddenly i heard her my voice saying it is not your time yet do not leave them behind my parents i teared because i knew i could not stay there and i knew i had to go back i swam and swam to the surface and when i was about to go out i closed my eyes so i can get used to the light and when i opened them this time i was in my room sleeping on my bed with my heartbeat back to normal it was the first time that i wake up without jumping out of my bed and i keep on thinking of that dream and if i was dying that night
672,my doppelganger tried to assasinate me.,i ve had such a blizzare dream last night and i just have to write it out somewhere because i can t stop thinking about it now i ve had my fair share of odd dreams ranging from not being able to wake up all while knowing that i m dreaming to my dream leaking into reality when i have sleep paralysis etc these things rarely shake me up because i am so used to them by now but last night s dream really really creeped me out throughout the whole dream my lookalike was actively hunting me in an attempt to assasinate me and i was actively running it looked just like me it was so uncanny the way i dress my hair eyes almost everything but one thing that disturbed me most was the expression it had there was something about that face that creeped me out to the core it was calculated cold and emotionless soulless even it was as if it had one goal and that was all that mattered there was a weapon a long knife which it used to attack me but i ended up attacking it and actually slicing its wrist i think i managed to escape before i woke up is this my brain subconsciously sending me signals that something s wrong a bad habbit maybe fear of something i ve no idea i did have a hard time in uni this past month and was under a lot of stress so perhaps that factored into this what do you think this might mean ps i quit reddit some time ago but i had to make an account just to post this that s how much it disturbed me lol 
673,dream interpretation,an acquaintance of mine died recently my brother used to be a close friend to him and is now quite sad about it in the dream my brother and at home i go down because someone calls me and i think it could be my uncle who says he would like to see me i go downstairs and find my cousin who is now year old and who looks between and years old and i am surprised because he is taller than me he looks at me and then bows his head he looks gloomy from the stairs i hear my uncle talking but i do not see him i go back to my room and my brother says he has something wrong like illness in parallel i hear a little voice but i do not understand what it means then i ask him how the crime with his friend happened and he tells me that there is a group of people who hate him and that he has hired a group of people who kill people with horses trampling them 
674,strange prophetic? alternate reality type dream,so i am pregnant and have strange dreams particularly because i have stopped smoking though that is months ago now and hormones yet when i was young and did not smoke i also had absurdly vivid dreams perhaps that was a reason for smoking to block out i am gonna share my dream but will change omit names i dreamt last night that i was in an emergency situation like an evacuation refuge gathering in a town hall or hotel it was quite big with lots of different areas everyone was there thousands of people there was a woman there who had curly hair she kept falling on her face i was certain that she was the sister of my real life baby dad is stepdad however i do not know the stepdad enough to have known if he had a sister or what she looks like or what her health situation is i was also not introduced to her in the dream let alone real life i just knew it was her later i saw babydads stepdad and mum and told them that stepdad sis was unwell there were coins everywhere i had brought the sister to an area for someone else to help then i saw my babys dad he was working in a shop area on the ground floor or next door a bit away from all of this i approached him and it felt as if we were only acquaintances like early days he asked me if i wanted to go to a gathering at dolly is house i was interested to go except irl my name is dolly he said even though her house was far away in and named a town which is actually closeby irl he would love to go irl i know one other lady with my name and she lives in a neighbouring country not a neighbouring town it makes me wonder where we were anyways the strange thing was when i told the dream to babys dad he told me that his stepdads sister had been unwell he asked me what did she look like and when i said she was fairly short with curly hair he said that sds sis has curly hair and is short tears came from my eyes as he told me this could just be pregnancy hormones what do you all make of this dream i feel a bit spooked by it and ca not quite shake it 
675,could you intepret my dream about a snake?,so since a long time i have had a dream that i wanted to remember this badly i remember dreaming a completely red snake that i took in my hand it tangled around my arm and i was kinda playing with it and turning it around and then it was going crazy and turning itself around and i had a little fear it would bite me but nothing happened i put it down and just went on later i saw an old friend of mine with whom i do not have no more contact in real life and i saw him being bitten by the same red snake on the finger we did not know if it was poisonous or not but he had pain and we tried to go to the hospital another friend that should have come did not come and also me suddenly i took another path and left my friend alone even if i did not want to thats the dream the thing is that i kinda know with what this dream is collegated yesterday i should have met with an old friend of mine not the same in the dream and after waiting on her for almost hours she just disappeared and dind t come so i realised that she is a false friend so i think that this dream is representig what happened yesterday while the snake might be my emotions still wanted to ask you guys shat do you think about it tl dr a red snake that i took on my hand later it bit an old friend of mine 
676,weird creature.,i had a weird dream or nightmare about a creature that was kinda like giant snake but it looked more like a giant hammerhead flatworm crossed with centipede and snake it was kinda flat spiky sides and segmented scaly body and with tongue that extended out of it is mouth that also had grabby looking mouth it is face looked like it had two mouths for some reason and it also had some extra tendrils for more grabbing spiky teeth that were seen at all times big flat mouth i think head was not that flat part i remember best was about this creature going around some city centre and people noticing it and running old school looking bus stopping in the middle of the street people running out of it basically chaos but people did not notice it right away i was at city square when it came to my view it lifted half it is body up and swiftly grabbed two people it was scary seeing how it bit a man in half while holding another one before all that i also remember at the start of dream that it was grown in a lab but they were unable to contain it because it grew too fast then it had to consume to grow gigantic 
677,travis scott desperately wanted me to be on his team,travis scott came to my family is house to find me and sing his new song which was angel by shaggy and he wanted my opinion on whether he should release it so then i walked outside to talk more and some reason there was a burger on the floor and travis scott got really mad that someone left it there and he left in a limo asking me to call him i know nothing about travis scott i only know the concert disaster and sicko mode 
678,what does this dream mean ?,my friend told me she had a dream of me killing myself in her dream we re close but we don t really text that often since she lives in the us and i m studying abroad but she suddenly texted me what i was doing and said that i held two knifes in both my hands and just slit my throat out of nowhere anybody know what this could possibly mean kinda freaked out help 
679,what is going on with me?,so everyday for about a month now maybe a bit longer events have been happening in real life that i ve dreamt about a few months prior this is happening everyday and i know i dreamt about these events because i remember specific details that have happened what is this it s low key really scary since it s happening everyday 
680,an odd place,i do not typically remember most dreams however this particular dream stood out to me as nothing short of a pure oddity from what i can remember i had gone just below the surface of the planet primarily under the ground in a field via an old broken wooden staircase once below the grassy field i was met with the sight of a brown stone ground with an immeasurable amount of stone pillars that varied in size and shape a large gap that dropped down into sheer darkness as well as an unfathomable amount of holes throughout the ground that too dropped into nothing but a pitch black void this place also had a decent gust to it wind eerily whistling throughout the landscape shaking this little wooden rope bridge that hung over the ravine gap between where i stood near where i entered to an area that looked the same as i had described to give more outlook into what this place looked it was large enough that i was unable to see if this place well stopped it seemed to go on forever moreover despite there being no lights natural or man made the place was oddly bright the oddest thing about this at least to me were things there were man made structures down there the bridge and the staircase that worked as an entrance and it felt as though i was not alone somehow within this dream i had the overwhelming feeling that i was not alone whatsoever past that i do not remember much else just what this place endless laminal nonsensical place looked like as well as how i had felt whilst in this place 
681,recurring dream theme: unconventional toilets with no privacy,for all my life as long as i can remember i have had this recurring dream theme centered around toilets that ca not be used for very weird reasons never because they are dirty or broken like i hear from other people but because their layout is so weird that if i used them i would be exposed in some way the situation i am in changes from dream to dream but the idea of a weird toilet is always there and me spending way too much time trying to figure it out that i wake up before i even got to do what appeared to be the main purpose of the dream when it first began it usually always starts with me wanting to do something else but telling someone i just need to use the bathroom first once it was before an exam at school and another time it was before i went into the pool at a country club i had to change into a swimsuit first and when i change i usually always pee but when i get to the toilet there is always a problem most of the time it is that the layout of the toilet or the door of the toilet has so many holes in it almost like a jigsaw puzzle that if i tried to pee someone outside the stall would be able to see the bathroom is always either really full or completely empty one time all three walls of the stall were just a bunch of rectangular holes and it freaked me out so much this is the true recurring theme of the dreams i am always worried i am going to be exposed or people will be able to see me naked because the damn toilets are never normal this usually results in me trying to find a way to use the bathroom so i can have some privacy but it takes so long that i wake up before i can do what i originally wanted to i never sat for the exam and i never got to go swimming but sometimes the script changes for example in the dream about going to sit an exam i started off wandering around looking for the bathroom i even went through a supermarket that randomly popped up in the school looking for the bathroom and had a whole other dream plot before i finally found the bathroom when i got to it it was huuge like a whole two story spa and there were toilets for little girls and women the little girls toilets were tiny so i had to use the women is ones but for some reason i could not open any of the doors to the stalls even though all but one was vacant so an old lady comes out of one of them and i ask her how to unlock the doors and she tells me to unlock a stall you had to first fuck yourself with a dildo it was so strange i had never done anything like that before i am so obviously i failed to and i never got to use the bathroom the dream ended with me trying to jam a dildo into myself there is also another one where i went to use the bathroom during a family function and ended up having sex with three grown men under the staircase to the toilet bizarre right there is so many other variations of this dream but it is always so frustrating that i can never use the bathroom in my dreams whenever there is a toilet i get a little anxious because of it i have never been able to use one there is always some weird catch to do with me being naked exposed or having sex doing something sexual i hope i can figure this out someday but for now it perplexes me 
682,black cat in my dream,i was out in road playin with a girl my bag ripped and my clothes all fell it looked like i was a vb player my friend helped me picked it up and an ginger cat meowed in the corner with another black cat who was just staring the cats color blended with the dark corner that got me come closer to see if it was a cat i threw my clothes to the ginger cat and it ran away then i threw it again at the blackcat that was right in front of me my clothes disappeared and it was still there staring at me it pulled me into the darkness and just kept falling it felt so comfortable that i wanted to just sleep while falling i felt a hand slowly grabbed my left wrist and the other was about to grabbed my right hand that was on my belly so basically it grabbed my boobie instead that did not kept me from wanting to just keep sleeping but a gut feeling that if i sleep i ll never wake up 
683,weird dream patterns,had a conversation with my coworker about reoccurring nightmares it reminded me of the weird dreams i had as a child i very often would dream of small animals dying in my hands one second i was holding an adorable puppy and the next it was a lifeless weighty piece of fur it confused me sometimes i still have dreams like this but no where near as often as when i was a kid i always wondered why i dreamt of such disturbing things i would grow attached to said small animal but it would always die always in my hands thoughts lmao
684,i never have dreams as myself,hello everybody i have dreams most nights but every single time i am never myself i am always someone else does this happen to anyone else does anybody have an explanation for this

686,dream about being unbearably hot,i had a dream about being extremely hot like i was in a volcano and i want to know what this may mean the dream started off with me on a beach i was alone until my family just randomly spawned the beach seemed to be on an island and behind me was a small city i remember it being burning hot on the beach so i decided to get into the water however when i got in the water felt like a hot tub and made me even more uncomfortable i was dreaming but i felt the heat like it was real me and my family were like let s get out of the water it s way too hot for this fast forward we walked to the city and got hotel rooms my hotel room was on the very top floor and it was again very very hot i opened the door to my room and my sister and i shared a room when i opened the door the room was all red literally nothing but red the lights the walls the beds the windows everything and it was so hot it had been even hotter than before and i remember dropping all of my bags and trying to fall alseep but i couldn t because of the unbearable heat i ran out of the room down to my cousins room and when i opened his door the whole room was blue just like my room it was cool this time though he seemed relaxed and i asked him if i could sleep in his room because my room was too hot he said sure my sister then came in and slept in there on the pull out couch what the hell does this mean and why is it so vivid and specific

689,a group of us were selected by an ai to save the future,a teacher a doctor a librarian a lawyer and a construction worker from around the world these were the five individuals chosen by an artificial intelligence system in a dystopian future to time travel to different eras in the past for the sake of saving humanity their hq located in a dimensional space only accessible through time portals found in their homes contained waypoints into the past that they would use to complete the missions given to them these five people banded together and used their time keys small special devices to access these waypoints however an evil organization with the goal of maintaining the dystopian future was determined to destroy the ai system and its members the dream begins with the first attack on headquarter by an alien octopus humanoid from the future this highly renown bounty hunter had captured construction worker and used him to enter the ai s hq the group was quickly alerted that headquarter was invaded and everyone rushed into battle but the team quickly faced defeat as the bounty hunter shamelessly used construction worker as a shield to their attacks lawyer who was dating construction worker developed a plan to separate him from the bounty hunter s grasp she succeeded but lost her life in the process the group did not let her sacrifice go to waste and quickly finished off the bounty hunter using their futuristic weapons although the team was able to kill the humanoid it reduced their number to several weeks after the first attack headquarter was attacked for a second time however this time a hooded enemy tried to enter through the portal in the late lawyer is home the team successfully sealed the portal before it was breached but the reality of the situation quickly crept in they would continue to be attacked and targeted as long as they were members of this group fear grew within doctor is mind arguments broke out between him and everyone else eventually he decided to quit for own his sake on his walk home he began to feel like he was being followed he became fearful and paranoid he walked into a crowded area thinking he had lose the stalker suddenly everyone started screaming doctor found himself staring at his back while his headless body fell to the ground the same hooded enemy that tried to breach headquarter walked out of the crowd with the head of the doctor in hand the killer dumped the head in a trash can and looked at their reward two time keys the killer dropped the keys on the ground and walked away as they removed the hood that was covering their face the scream and fear caused by the public decapitation quickly alerted the remaining three members construction work whom was still recovering from losing the love of his life quickly reached the scene only to find more despair as he laid eyes on the remains of the doctor teacher and librarian soon followed construction worker showed them the time keys and asked why there were two these highly advanced devices contain the information of those that touch it one of the time keys had one person logged while the other had two the latter had the doctor is id logged as well as the killers the former only had the killer is id that s when they learned that the killer was their late friend the lawyer who sacrificed herself during the st attack but how could that be she was dead a flashback to the killer unhooding herself revealed that she was a blue skinned zombified version of the late lawyer she walked away from the body and into a time portal she created so after teacher librarian and construction worker realized that the killer was zombie lawyer and that she was somehow able to create time portals without the use of the ai system teacher came to the conclusion that if they captured her they could use her time portal creation technology to bring their friends back to life by taking advantage of a time travel paradox known as time remnants this is when you travel back in time and change an event without changing the conclusion of the event for example if the conclusion of the st attack is that lawyer dies they can travel back in time and replace her past living self with the body of the future dead self and bring the past living self into the future that way the history won t change she s still dead at that point in time but she ll be alive in the future then the dream ended 
690,what is this called?,is there a name for this when i was younger i would have weird night mares that were similar to sleep paralysis but i don t think it was because i ve had sleep paralysis before and it wasn t it it would happen randomly during the night sometimes many times i would wake up or be trying to sleep and my mind would focus on a random noise either it being a neighbour dog barking the fridge buzzing noise or even that loud ringing in your head when there is no sound my body would go in a paralysed state and i wouldn t be able to breathe then it felt like whatever noise that mind was focusing it would be x louder like it s right next to me i would eventually wake up but when i tried to go back to sleep sometimes it would just happen again so some mornings it would be like am and i would just stay until i had to leave to school because it would just happen again if i tried to sleep eventually i grew out of it what is this 
691,i solved a murder mystery but the killer got away,the dream started with a series of dramatic events a high school kid was killed in his trailer and a muslim girl was assaulted on her way home i was playing the part of a high school student who was secretly investigating these cases the school gossip was that the principal was jealous that his wife a high school teacher was cheating on him with the student who was suspected to be the dead kid so the principal confronted the student and killed him however evidence began to build up against the dead kid s girlfriend the police decided to arrest the girlfriend thinking she had found out her boyfriend cheated with a teacher and killed him in a confrontation but their evidence was weak eventually i spoke with the muslim girl about her assault she was hesitant to speak to anyone because she feared the attacker would return she was also friends with the victim and mentioned how she witnessed a confrontation between him and his girlfriend sometime around the guy s time of death i convinced the muslim girl into testifying but she would only do it if i did her the favor of finding her favorite cd album i found the album somewhere in school and the muslim girl agreed to testify come the night of the trial i had an epiphany after connecting all the information everyone gave me about the muslim girl the guy and his girlfriend i realized the muslim girl was the killer before the dead kid and his girl were dating he was seen a lot with the muslim girl everyone suspected they were a couple and this upset her parents due to their religion so they stopped hanging out and the guy began officially dating his now girlfriend meanwhile he was actually secretly seeing the muslim girl during the time of his murder the muslim girl and guy were arguing because she was jealous of his real girlfriend then he tried to force himself on her but she refused so they got physical she grabbed something hit him and killed him she panicked and faked an assault near her home to explain her injuries she wanted the cd because it was actually a mixtape that the guy made for her i went to confront her with the truth but woke up before i could so maybe she got away with the murder haha also the rumor about the teacher cheating on the principal with a student was true but that student was me

693,first and only team i got paralyzed,i was having a funny dream about trying to find a public bathroom with no one inside so i could poop in private lol when a strange noise in my bedroom woke me up i had two dogs sleeping on the floor so my immediate thought was that it was one of them snoring but then i heard a third voice i was confused and closely listened to confirm that what i was hearing was not one of the dogs so i counted that is dog that is the other and that is a third voice the voice was whispering something around where the dogs were laying immediately i saw an opportunity as this was not the first time i have heard whispers in the dark i tried to listen and make out what the voice was saying the whisper sounded deep and ominous it was a little far from me but i could tell that it was not english and it was more of a chant the whispers were slow and i could hear all the syllables it was something like ika nao ta shi ash ika nao ta shi ash shi after i noted that the third voice was chanting something in an unknown language i acted to protect the doggos from further nightmarish happenings i moved to confront whatever was there as i have done in the past but suddenly my entire body went numb i could feel the numb tingly sensation pulsating throughout me ugh i could feel my soul attempting to move but my body was not following like pushing up against a wall with all your strength expecting it to budge my vision then started to fluctuate the clarity of the walls in my room had suddenly become emphasized like if some drugs just kicked in i was losing my grip on reality i tried calling out to the dogs but my voice did not reach them so i pushed side to side until finally i was able to move and everything appeared normal again side note when we sleep our parasympathetic system takes over blood pressure and heart rate decline and pupils become smaller when we are awake we are more accessible to sympathetic responses active fight or flight mode during fight or flight heart rate increases bp increases and pupils dilate this sleep paralysis happened around am am according to my sleep tracker my heart rate went from bpm to bpm during that time at around the same time my vision became blurry and it was difficult to focus symptoms of dilation sounds like my sympathetic nervous system kicked in hard once i realized i could not move lol 
694,i scared my sleep demon,i was at a dream friend s house sitting on their sofa and conversing when the entire atmosphere of the dream changed it went from calm cool and collected to gray and melancholy as my dream friends continued the conversation like nothing was happening something behind them caught my attention from one of the doorways came a tall gray skinned woman in a white tulle ball gown i remember she walked rather rigidly almost robotic with her arms straight down her sides and had beautiful long black hair then i started hearing whispers she was saying something but her voice was so low that i couldn t quite make out what it was i kept trying to focus on it but before i knew it i was awake turned on my side and facing my bedroom wall even so i could still hear the whispers and that wasn t the only thing my body felt extremely heavy as if it was being pushed down onto the bed it was then that i felt a presence on the other side of my bed it reminded me of the many times when i was a kid in bed and too scared to turn around and see what was lurking behind me i became determined to finally answer the age long question of is anything actually there like pulling off a band aid i quickly turned around to face the supposed boogeyman on my bed was a shadow creature with its arms stretch out towards me and shaking its slenderman like fingers it had a snake shaped body and its head was elongated with no actual face though you could still see the indentations of eyes and a mouth when i turned around i had almost headbutted it the creature not expecting me to be awake and moving froze with a silly flabbergasted look on its face a second later it threw its hands up in the air and screeched in fear i just stared at it completely surprised at what i was seeing while the creature jumped off my bed and proceeded to fly through my bedroom walls 
695,i chatted with a girl at god's valley,i was once inside a hotel at a bar called god s valley when i noticed a group of people having a fun conversation there was a girl in the group that would change appearance every time she expressed an emotion i was intrigued and decided to approach her to ask why her appearance changed so much i have my emoji feature on she replied i didn t want to follow up with another question to not alert anyone and simply said thank you and walked away i walked out of the bar and headed towards the entrance of the hotel the concierge saw me walking by so i politely smiled and nodded in their direction as i walked towards the door the blinding light shining through made me realize how poorly lit the inside of the hotel actually was i pushed to open the door and walked outside but a moment later i was awake in bed 
696,the first time i started questioning my reality,i woke up in a townhouse in the downtown of some unknown city thinking it was a dream i started exploring my surroundings and checking my physical features normal as far as i could tell i walked outside to see a busy street out in the distance was a unique looking train station with an enormous dome that towered over all the surrounding buildings what s that place over there i asked a person passing by that s the station they said hesitantly to where i asked the other worlds they mumbled intrigued by their response i decided to explore the station next i arrived there and walked into the first train i saw it was very crowded but the people around me slowly started to back away and stare i didn t really know what to make of it but a second later someone placed their hand on my shoulder and an immense pressure of gravity overcame me it was so strong that it forced me onto my knees what the f i shouted in anger at the forced submission i struggled as i used all my strength to stand back up while everyone just stared i turned my head up to see the person that touched me it was a police officer of some sort you re a feisty one huh he said alright let s get you out of here he put his face close to mine i remember it being blue and definitely not human but not unfamiliar his face then unexpectedly changed into that of a demon is and quickly back to normal i didn t get scared but the surprise sent a chill throughout my body and before i knew it i was safely back in bed 
697,i stopped to watch two summoners face off,i was exploring a metropolis and stopped to see a standoff between two summoners in a plaza what s going on i asked a nearby person they were arguing about who was stronger and now they re going to fight they said just then one of the summoners raised an open palm and then closed it into a fist a red and gray door rose out of the ground behind him it opened and a fog came out followed by a gorilla like robot the size of a tank the summon had enormous blades as hands that stabbed into the ground as it walked it jumped forward with incredible speed and slashed the enemy summoner in half the enemy fell to the floor but soon disappeared and reformed a couple of steps away from the robot great now i m one life down he said the second summoner took in a deep breath and clasped his hands together he exhaled into the clasp and a mist started coming out the crevices between his fingers the flow of mist continued onto the ground where it quickly formed into a line of ice an ice door then rose from it and slowly creaked open the air that came out was chilling the ground around the area froze along with some of the bystanders watching from the door walked out a beautiful woman with light blue skin and long platinum hair the gorilla robot moved to attack but it hadn t noticed that its mechanical joints had frozen too the woman elegantly moved her hand from left to right instantly freezing everything in its path it was only a couple of moments later that i woke up 
698,munchkins and fairies called me master,i was invisible and watching a story unfold in what i remember being a world that was like a cross between the wizard of oz and candy land i was in munchkin town where the munchkins were in some drama involving the neighboring fairies don t remember the exact details i remember becoming frustrated with the developments and ignorantly interfered by proclaiming that what they were all doing was stupid and wrong suddenly all the munchkins and fairies jumped back completely shocked to see me it was then that i realized that they had no idea i was there could i have been invisible to them i thought they all carefully started to surround me and mumble words one of them grabbed my hand and said master you re here all the munchkins and fairies became elated and began pulling me towards their city center i was so confused why are they calling me master i thought why are they so happy to see me they were literally about to start a war it was only a couple of moments later that i woke up

704,i was a sea witch's zompire slave,me and a couple of friends were traveling the world together when we decided to stay overnight at a local rundown church in some random town we were passing by while getting ready to call it a night one of my friends suggested we go exploring for this old attic entrance that a church caretaker told us about we were able to find this small hidden door in one of the hallways which revealed a passage behind the walls following the passage lead to stairs that lead to the hidden attic pleased with our successful exploration we headed back to our rooms to sleep when i woke up in the morning all my friends were gone i walked around the church looking for them but they were no where to be seen i found one of the church caretakers praying with a group of people and asked him if he is seen my friends he said he had not seen anyone around and then i told him about our nightly adventure to the hidden attic the caretaker looked at me strangely and said no one should be able to get in there we decided to go investigate the hidden passage i showed him the secret door we found but upon further inspection i noticed it was completely bolted shut dumbfounded by this discovery i turned to the caretaker only to find him gone as well confused by his sudden disappearance i turned around to find the small secret door now open when i looked through the door something on the other side scratched my face and got my eye i screamed in pain and tried running away when i bumped into another person who grabbed me and bit into my neck the thing behind the hidden door came out too and joined in on the fun by biting into my arm they twisted my neck and i died from there i entered a rd person view and witnessed what they did with my body these things resembled grotesques zombie vampires that could hide their appearance at will by looking human their pale blue skin rotted from their body exposing the layers of muscles beneath their teeth bulged out like those of piranhas and their eyes were black with red centers they walked openly during the day and behaved like everyone else but at night they revealed their true form and they hunted prey to devour those that could not would be struck with a hunger so bad that only eating their own rotting flesh would quench it they took my body and put it in a coffin where i was transported to a local dock my body sat in the coffin until night time when someone came to open it suddenly i came back to life i too was no longer human my body had morphed into that of a grotesque zompire too at the dock were several other zompires waiting in line for something to happen the one who opened my coffin told me to stand up and prepare myself i did as i was told and moments later a ginormous yet beautiful sea witch rose from the water her plump body was a light blue color with a beautiful round face and long blonde hair her lips were a bright red and her seemingly kind blue eyes were wide and shined with a sense of godliness i was captivated by her beauty my children she said have you brought me what i desire one of my new brethren stepped forward and hunched over he began to puke everything he had eaten fingers toes hair eye balls all sorts of body parts came out the sea witch leaned over and began inspect the pile of partially digested human flesh she opened her mouth and her purple tongue slithered out it wrapped itself around the pile of flesh and brought it back to her mouth she chewed and moaned pleased with the offering she looked at the next person in line the frightened zompire stepped forward and puked a much smaller pile of flesh the sea witch looked down in disappointment suddenly her jaw unhinged from her mouth exposing her large sharp piranha teeth she quickly chomped down on the zompire completely devouring it in one fell swoop i could see the bulge of the once human being slowly making its way down her throat i stood in terror the next in line was a zompire with a zompire baby she leaned over with delight my what a cutie she said the zompire stretched out it is arms and offered the zompire baby to its god the sea witch took the zompire baby with two fingers lifted it up into the air and dropped it straight into her mouth she did not have to chew for that one the next was an extremely large zompire he must have been close to pounds the zompire did not offer anything to the sea witch she became furious she chomped down on the fat zompire but even he was too big for her to swallow in one bite she lifted him up in her mouth and chomped down multiple times his guts and blood sprayed out painting the entire dock in his color it was my turn next she looked at me already angry at the fat zompire is lack of offering what do i give her i had nothing i froze and could do nothing she leaned over and looked at me intensely she waited for me to do something but when it became clear that i had nothing she lifted her head once more in disgust here it comes i thought suddenly a portal opened to her right she turned to it with delight ah finally you have arrived she echoed out of the portal came three blue skinned zompires but they were different from all the ones i have seen before their eyes were still black with red centers and their teeth sharp as ever but their flesh was not rotting they did not look rundown but instead as if they were from an elite class furthermore i knew these zompires they were my missing friends

706,losing weight,i am in the living room of the house where i grew up when i hear my father coming down the hall at first i visualize him as a monster with the head of a lizard pushing his way through a door when he arrives however he is a tall thin man in black not unlike the photos we have of him as a young man my mother comments on his weight loss observing that people at thanksgiving thought he was a cousin that they had not met he is coming to beat me with a canoe paddle but the talk of his losing weight distracts him he goes to sit in the tv room i grab the paddle and hide it in the hall closet i find another that i put in the same place my brother catches me and hands me a third with a handle like a rifle butt it does not fit 
707,hide and seek nsfw, dreami was in my grandma is old house it was dark i was naked and playing hide and seek with a mystery man there was just enough light to make out shapes of things i was excited i waited crouched down in the living room by her old corduroy feeling couch it was a bit chilly and i had goosebumps everywhere mystery man found me and i ran down the hallway i knew that by going down the hallway there was little chance of escape it is a big house but this hallway just leads to bedrooms i bolted into the first room the guest room it has always been the guest room with one big bed one vintage dresser and a big window with lace curtains he was right behind me he grabbed me in a hug and we fell on the bed laughing i looked at him it was still very dark i began to see the outline of a face hair and maybe facial hair but i turned away from him in his embrace we laid down with me the little spoon and got under the covers to get warm i could smell my grandmother is house in those sheets i could feel his warmth it was comforting i fit laying my head on his arm as he brought both arms around me in that moment somehow i knew we had been intimate before even though i had never met him feeling his naked body pressed against my backside i wondered if we would be again my heart still pounded like he was chasing me i scooted my butt just an inch away and i woke up i laid there trying to decide if i scooted away so that he had get the hint that i was not ready or if i was giving him the room he needed to slide into me 
708,we were ambushed and i was taken,my friend and i walked into a gated area that resembled a graveyard with the hope that the local spirits would protect our bodies we found a nice flat spot somewhere and laid down to sleep the spirits began watching us walk around in astral form we entered a portal right next to our bodies and emerged in a familiar safe house we took off the pendants that protected us placed it on a nearby table and walked upstairs where we found a group of friends waiting we were all talking and enjoying each others company when a sudden explosion destroyed part of the house humanoid enemies and dark creatures started making their way through the smoke our gathering turned into chaos we did not have our pendants so we could not protect ourselves we tried to escape but they caught my friend and dragged her away some of the others tried fighting back however they could i ran downstairs to get my pendant but soon realized it got blasted somewhere in the explosion the dark creatures started coming after me too so i started screaming for helping that is when another team appeared it was a group of allies already in full gear they started using their skills to destroy the dark creatures and the other humanoid enemies they tried making it to me but the creatures had dragged me away far enough to take me through their portal we emerged in a stone room and they threw me into a dark pit my body suddenly felt like the skin was melting off while some liquid slowly replaced it i screamed in pure agony and woke back up in the graveyard i turned my head and saw my friend was still asleep with tears running down my face i whispered to her i am sorry i am sorry a group of unknown men appeared and lifted me off the floor i screamed and resisted as they pulled me away from her my vision began fluctuating and i could see the spirits still watching us i tried asking them for help but they just stood there silently no one should have known our location someone betrayed us i was taken somewhere and the dream ended 
709,i flew around with my dragon brother and found a city on the back of a large beast,i am in a war torn planet fighting off an invading army i was at a base when i ran into one of my brothers in the past i have dreamt of older brothers who did not exist in real life this was the nd youngest we talked and he tells me we should get out of there he proceeds to turn into a dragon and encourages me to hop on i excitingly do so he was a rather long river dragon i wrapped my arms around his neck locked my hands and we took off he was fast he flew up higher and higher into the sky while making holes through the clouds i was getting scared from the altitude and started wondering how high he planned on going i felt the air pressure sliding me down his scaly body so i tightened my hold we flew all the way to the planet is outer atmosphere i could feel the cold pressure of space and see the light from the nearby sun reflecting off the curvature of the planet it was beautiful beyond belief he then decided to be a troll and started freefalling the sudden shift to downward gravity and the quickly approaching ground had me crapping my pants as i held onto him for dear life he eventually stopped being a douche and readjusted his body towards the horizon while casually cruising through the sky we noticed an entire city on the back of an enormous creature traversing a dessert i was not sure what kind of creature it was so i told my brother to get closer he started flying around the slow beast is large legs while i curiously inspected it is dark rough and dried out skin my brother got close to its eye which was now obviously larger than his dragon body the eye looked at us and blinked slowly i gazed with wonder and waved hello my brother began to move away and i went back to holding him with a large smile on my face i told my brother how much i loved him and the dream ended 
710,is there a subreddit based on the science of dreaming and not people talking about their dreams?,am wondering if theres a subreddit dedicated to talking about the science of dreaming like people talking about what causes it their personal experiences in having more lucid dreams and etc
711,recurring dream about a house-- not sure what it means,i used to have a recurring dream about a certain house fairly frequently but i had not had it for probably at least years until now i have never seen the house in real life but it is always the same in my dreams except last night it was a little different it is a very large story house and in the dreams i have lived in it for at least a few years but i almost never go upstairs the first floor is very homey and familiar and i am happy living there but the focus of the dream is never on that floor it is always about the other two it is also never about the people i live with that does not seem important at all it is about the house itself sometimes the point in the dream seems to be simply that i am wasting money paying to heat and cool a story house that i only use story of and i should either move to a smaller house or start using the rest of it more often the point seems to be more about why i have been avoiding those floors the rd floor feels somewhat ominous i am afraid of it to different degrees from one dream to the next sometimes i think it is haunted and i refuse to even go up there but other times i am just a little afraid of it for no apparent reason but i ll at least go up there to check it out in one dream i decided to face my fear and finally arrange furniture in one room on that floor into a cozy living room and hang out there and watch movies by myself when everyone else was gone but then bad things happened i do not remember what and it made me not want to use that floor anymore the second floor does not seem ominous but i still seem to not want to use it for some reason but then i periodically think it is silly and or wasteful to have all those rooms and not use them so i start to think about using the second floor but then i end up just going back to the first floor and forgetting about it last night after at least years of not dreaming about it i dreamt of the same house with the same situation not using the nd and rd floors and my mom said i should block off the stairs and turn off the heat vents to reduce my heating bill a practical suggestion which is typical of my mom but instead i went exploring to remind myself what was up there because it had been a long time this time i found all kinds of cool stuff that i did not know was there especially musical instruments i am a band director and i play many instruments in real life and board games which i love to play irl it made me really want to start using the whole house even the rd floor which was not as scary this time i was still a little wary of it but open to the idea of starting to use it i also realized that the nd floor had everything people would need if they wanted to live on that floor a kitchen a bathroom living room and at least two bedrooms and the rd floor had at least rooms that could all be bedrooms or one could be a living room den game room home office or playroom for kids it occurred to me that i could let my brother live there he is currently staying with me irl because of financial difficulty and maybe my sister who is also going through hard times irl or start a bed and breakfast or something so if i am not going to use it at least other people could be using and enjoying the otherwise unused parts of the house in the dream i had last night i was excited about fixing it up dusting cobwebs and furnishing decorating the rooms on the nd and rd floors unlike other instances of the dream when i just kind of shrugged and went oh well i guess i just have extra floors for no reason any thoughts on how to interpret any parts of the dream 
712,i keep seeing my ex situationship,so its been around months and we barely talk but i keep seeing him in my dreams specifically every friday does this mean something or am i just getting my hopes up
713,home is filled with ghosts,last night i had a dream about ghosts i ve never dreamt about ghosts before so would love to hear your thoughts i was living in an apartment with my family that i don t recognise in fact everything about the apartment block we lived in is unrecognisable down to the car that was featured in my dream so the dream started with my family and i gathering our luggage to put into the car and leave for some sort of road trip i am then suddenly by myself going back to the apartment to pick up some clothes that i ve forgotten my family is waiting for me in the car as i enter the apartment i realise all the lights are still on and i think ah good thing i came back or this would have been such a waste of electricity i turn off a few on the way to my bedroom as i turn them off the atmosphere starts to become really creepy and i start to get a little scared it s almost as if the color in my dream drains to black and white and everything gets colder and darker at this point i start hurrying up pick up my clothes and then start to head out downstairs but then i remember i m still missing some clothes so reluctantly i turnaround and start back up the stairs i m getting more panicky with each second and i m trying to stay calm and not leg it from my home i dash up the stairs and then bump into a woman my hand brushes up against her shoulder but immediately she fades to the side i m freaking out internally but move on to grab more clothes before running out of my apartment i could tell that there were many more ghosts inside my apartment they may not have hurt me immediately but i was potentially in danger in the elevators of my apartment building which was a mix of construction site looking panels and walls there are many people the hallways of the building are also filled with people and there s a stark contrast between the inside of my apartment and outside it s warm out here the strangers aren t necessarily kind though and i feel suspicious about some of them but at least they aren t ghosts realising i ve forgotten yet another piece of clothing i suddenly bump into a friend of mine one i ve not spoken to in a year or more but friendly all the same and ask him to accompany me back to my apartment once again i enter and am overwhelmed by the quiet negative atmosphere of my apartment i run around grabbing clothing a mix of stuff and likely not what i came back for it doesn t matter i just need to get out of here finally i make it out i don t think i have everything i went back for but i m scared my family is waiting and i m sure i can just buy any clothing i need as i try to close the door i realise it s not locking and the double doors are no longer aligned i m afraid the ghosts might make it out i ask my friend for help and he magically fixes it he comes with me to my family car on the way i explain what i ve just experienced and i feel relieved to share and gets in i m trying to explain to my family what s happened but they just seem apathetic and uninterested i guess i m not making much sense either and that s when i wake up

717,dreamception (nsfw),i had a dream within a dream last night and i was having trouble deciphering whether or not the dream within the dream was real because it felt very real so in the dream within the dream there was this woman who was advertised on tiktok or something for providing some type of service i do not exactly remember what it was but it was something professional i ended up in a zoom meeting with her which was pretty professional yet low key at the same time but at the end of the meeting she started exposing her breasts to me at first i theist was a nip slip but then she was just full on showing them she was very attractive and they were very nice and pierced so i got pretty turned on and showed her mine and was like mine are pierced too so things are getting hot and heavy and we decide to meet up in real life real life and it turns out she has a boyfriend and they bring me to this party that has all kinds of food and there is drinking smoking and there were scattered pills that i am assuming we are drugs but i did not take any the food was arranged very strangely too like there were dessert items on top of pizza almost covering it and the pizza was definitely from pizza hut i vaguely remember becoming a third for this couple and having a good time with them at some point in the original dream i was with friends and was telling them about this experience and trying to determine if it actually happened i was trying to describe who the woman was and looked through my phone to try and find our texts and looked her up on social media but i could not find her or our texts all i remembered about her name was that her username was uh nuh or uhnuh i did not get her real name but i could not find her or the texts and that is when i realized it was all a dream but it felt so real waking up from the original dream was trippy and then one of my friends in actual real life well on discord but in real life not in the dream started telling me about weird pizza hut menu items which i got deja vu about when writing this because i completely forgot about that detail until just now so there is no way he could have known and it was unprompted 
718,i had a nightmare with a dream demon,is this a lucid dream i awoke at am and tried to sleep again i slept then awoke again but paralyzed all of a sudden something was touching me and physically it felt real while tihs was happening i was not it some random place i was still in my room then i awoke and stopped being paralyzed i slept again and within seconds i was paralyzed again and to my left there was a little creature stretching its hand towards me arm was twice its body length it was making a sound just like the girl from the ring continuously i thought it was my brother who was sleeping next to me but it was not while the creature was making this distinct noise my brother made a loud snore and i knew the two were not the same i tried immediately waking up i could feel myself moving my neck trying to scream but on able to make soft grunts and moving my leg when i awoke i looked immediately to the left and the little creature was completely gone and my brother was still asleep and made another deep sound snore never had i experienced such a dream and i was wondering if this is something that really happens why did it feel so real and why was it in my room with no changes i really thought it was not real until i heard my brother snore it seemed like there were three of us in the room in that very instant until i completely awoke can transitioning into dreams from being awake in the real world be unnoticeable especially if the dream you enter is set in your exact same room i have not watched anything scary or anything relating to imps and dream demons for years so this was not fresh in my mind 
719,"the show must go on, jerry (tom and jerry dream art)",this is some art based on the weird tom and jerry dream i had enjoy 
720,a horrible nightmare inside a hallway.,i wanted to share this weird vivid dream that i had today i male found myself inside a hallway walking alongside women following this person he was leading us down the halls if i had to describe the hallways it is like a decrepit subway halls that have been abandoned towards somewhere deep inside it moments later he started to sped up his pace and me and the other follows along and then suddenly the walls of the hallway became distorted and disfigured like reality is bending i remebered i was so scared and i hold hands with one of the women and started pulling her as to not lose her and she did the same towards the other so on and so forth the pathfinder then pulled my arm and said hurry we were like chain of link following and running across the disfigured hallways until we turn left and reach this narrow pathway hall with dead end that looks normal exhausted from all the running we rest for a while until i realize woman was left behind she soon showed up but seems to unable to enter where we are and just stood there crying then she looked left and shit man that face she made i ca not describe it well but the look of debelief and denials whatever she saw was true terror she shake herself on the spot and vibrating as if trying to move but glued on the spot moments later she got yanked to her left her screams echoes so hard my ears are ringing blood stared to splatter in my point of view for context the rest of us were in this narrow way hallway on the dead end me and the others hug each other cover our ears and shut our eyes then it stopped i opened my eyes and cheked the others still shocked from the horror not brave enough to find out but then i looked at end of the path where we came from stood there a figure malform looked at me it started to scream then yelling and cursing and swearing at me for letting this happen and just watching i cried and then i woke up i remeber it so clearly and just found myself dumbfounded after and i wanted your opinion on it thank you for your attention 
721,i keep dreaming about attending a university i've never seen irl,i f am a college dropout turned bodywork practitioner i have no desire to go back to college but for two nights in a row this week and several more before that i have been dreaming of being a sorority sister within this fancy uni i have never seen before one of the main buildings is super tall and covered in mirrored windows there was a botanical garden w a big granite slab waterfall fountain separate from this but still somewhere on campus whole place looked to be in a really busy college town like it was fixed on the main street so you could walk to restaurants bars and theaters somewhere nearby without ever being seen there is a beach st night i was dressed up by my sisters as a goddess and had to invite as many people as i could to our sorority is night time event whatever that was a mob was protesting on the steps of the main building of mirrored windows what they were protesting the day before spring break i have no idea they threw food and trash at anyone trying to get into or out of the building including at a homeless man and his dog who were just walking by so i shot pretty rocks at the protesters w a slingshot i did not know i had nd night the protesters are gone badfish by sublime was playing on a loudspeaker in the morning and i found the garden i had a friend breakup there with one of my sisters at the sorority it reminded me a lot of banshees of inisherin where i went through too much to try to understand the breakup despite her being abundantly clear that she simply did not like me anymore besides maybe people i saw in passing i do not know anyone i see in the dreams irl but it is all the same cast and they all come w a backstory that i never learn i just wake up in the dream and have intrinsic knowledge about them sisters profes friends i even have a whole will they wo not they situation going on with my favorite professor is nephew t a that is been going on since my freshman year i wonder if this means anything or if i ll find this place like is it real it is pretty fixed in what it looks like but because the campus itself is so big and open i get lost in the city sometimes 
722,what does it mean? (trigger warning posted at top),this will be a long post also adding a trigger warning for blood suicide and infidelity so small background story i m working through my husbands physical and emotional infidelity that took place over a year ago with an ex that he reconnected with on tinder as well as digital online infidelity from others on tinder and other websites i fell pregnant shortly after discovery of the affair s i gave birth on jan th to our fourth child years after we decided to be done having kids i have been in great emotional pain the entire pregnancy and attempted to have an abortion early in the pregnancy rvw was overturned days before my scheduled procedure i was very suicidal during this time about myself i have always been a vivid dreamer and have made predictions and have had premonitions based on dreams i worked with a psychic and medium for years as an apprentice training with the tarot and palm readings past life connections my dreams are very apparent when they re important they often contain smells and physical touches tastes if a dream lacks a sensory ability i usually write it off as nothing more than my mind creating funny odd scenarios or situations however yesterday i had a dream without any of my senses but it seemed apparent i m trying to interpret the meaning i was in a place that lacked color the rooms were white i could not stand in this place i was sort of crawling around like an insect it was uneasy i stumbled upon a dining room table that was quite nice a dark wood with a crest on each chair my family was there but they were seen as toys or pieces that i could hold i set the table up with the family my husband at the head of the table the protector i began bleeding i couldn t tell where from but it appeared to be from my vagina the blood pooled around this table i started to cry and curled up with the toys as if i was grieving i talked to a friend about it who suggested maybe it was a doll house i can t make sense of it i had it night before last and am still thinking of it the heaviness i felt in my heart in the dream washed over me like a shockwave i m still carrying some of it today that is why i feel the dream may be significant 
723,dreamt of the same imaginary guy years after the first dream.,back in or i had a dream where my brother and i were walking home from the store when i had gotten home there was a tall blonde boy that was my age in my house and was worried for me when he saw me he immediately ran up to me and hugged me we then went outside and sat by my pool and cuddled this dream wouldn t be weird except for how accurate it was i am no stranger to vivid dream but what was confusing when i woke up was how nothing about my house or the neighboring places was distorted when i dream of a recognizable place or somewhere i ve been before it s usually very distorted and i only know what it is because it s my dream and my brain i had written this dream down and said i wanted to dream of the boy again because the dream made me feel really good and really safe i didn t dream of him again till last night last night i had a dream that a tall blonde boy had given me a series of cards when all read together would reveal his confession to me when i had finished reading them he had wrapped his arm around me and i leaned into him and told him i really liked his cards he then pulled me closer and hugged me tighter and kissed the top of my head this hug had that same feeling the first dream had where i felt safe and warm my only theory is that i had a crush on my best friend when we re freshman i m a senior now and maybe it s still lingering but i have had dreams of him before and i don t think he is the same boy in my other dreams what does this mean 
724,had a dream that the beach was full of dead sharks and cardinals died at the shore line,in the dream i went to the beach and i saw a lot of great white sharks either just floating dead or washed up on the shore some sharks looked like they got a chunk of flesh bitten off or the just wrotted away the strangest part was seeing red cardinals dead or dying on the shore line with the occasional black bird 
725,i was dreaming through my best friend's perspective and saw myself dead,what does this mean i thought that was not supposed to be possible but i was having this crazy dream last night where i was not myself i was one of my friends for some reason and he i was coming over to my house where i saw my own corpse hanged on a tree in the backyard of my house it was deeply unnerving and i am having trouble wrapping my head around it what does this mean how does this even happen i thought it was not possible to die in your own dream but i can remember seeing it so vividly i did not think it was possible to have a dream as another person either i have never had a dream like this before and to say i am a little creeped out is a major understatement
726,visitings/creepy dreams,i ve never experienced anything like this before i just woke up on a panic attacks after the weirdest dreams i ve probably ever had ghosts weird creatures were visiting me from the afterlife and telling me things about my life one after the other they would visit me in weird places one of them made me face my fears it became horror movie like after a while and became very full on and creepy has anyone else experienced this it felt so real too 
727,"i had a dream that my partner had to mercy kill a dying bald eagle that we found, what does it mean?",there is not much more context we saw it fall out of the sky and found it full of bullets and dying so my partner used a hunting knife to mercy kill it 
728,house fire dream,this morning i woke up from a panic dream in which my childhood home was engulfed in flames and everyone wasn t doing shit about it while i m frantically trying to call the fire department of course my phone isn t working and every time i get close to punching something goes wrong at one point my ex boyfriend from years ago pulled up in a truck and started making fun of me for making such a big deal about it i started beating his face in and trying to explain the severity of the situation and he just got pissed at me i finally woke up audibly saying mom because she was there just not doing anything it was so fucking frustrating and i m glad it s over now but i m wondering what the heck it means 
729,on the run,new to reddit so you may see me several times in the next few days alright so this dream happened my first semester out of high school it started with me picking up my high school best friend g by pulling up in another friend is c late eighties sedan his name was chester i yelled to g to get in the car we had to go no time to waste etc she got in confused and before she even had the door closed i was burning rubber she questioned me and i was telling her that i maybe did something but uh she probably would not like it i told her we needed to stop for supplies at a grocery store so we stopped and went in this is where my attitude changed we ran into another friend a who also came with us but as we are going around looking for rations since we are trying to get out of town i apparently decided i did not care if we got caught at this point i still do not actually know what i did that would have the cops on my tail other than stealing chester we got around the store and a and g are putting practical things in the cart first aid stuff rope bread canned goods duct tape etc while i am putting in oreos and bubbles a pulls my items out of the cart telling me we ca not get those we are already shoplifting so we have to get as little as possible so we wo not get caught i keep putting oreos and bubbles in the cart because clearly they are so needed and who would notice a and g certainly did not we made it out i got my extra items we sneak back to the car it is around this time that i realize i am on the run because i murdered someone hm sounds a bit out of character for me but pop off i guess g gets in the driver is seat and we fled for the outskirts of town sidenote this is a dusty desert town while i live in cornfields we almost make it before i see something out of the corner of my eye another friend two of them actually my token gay friend t of high school is sitting on the ground in a back alley sort of place with our last friend is laying in his lap she is his girlfriend apparently to clarify his being gay was not the only reason they never dated she was there though because she had been stabbed not by me i am sure and was slowly bleeding out we had stopped to see what they were doing and when everyone realized how bad off s was they looked at me to see if i could help her using my extensive medical knowledge i agreed to kneeled beside her and made everyone back up i looked at her wounds i could fix this then i looked back at t back at her and i started to fix it but i was going too slowly and i knew it i knew she would only slow us down she would take up space in the car and most importantly with her gone she would be out of the way with t so i let her bleed out i sat there for a moment then got up and went back to the group apologized and made us go on our way the last thing i remember is remembering that the person i murdered c chester is owner 
730,weird/scary dreams when sleep-deprived half awake half asleep.,alright so yesterday was the second time this has happend first time was a month back it was late am i had been listening to some scary movie stories on youtube for about an hour or too when i decides enough is enough and try to sleep when i turned off my phone i wasnt feeling too tired but when i closed my eyes i felt like i was on the verge of falling asleep my body became so immobilized and when i was halfasleep i kept having this weird uncanny feeling and i rolled over to the other side again and again until finally i tried not to roll over and stay put and then out of nowhere bang everything turned bright for a split second and it sounded like too metal pans getting smashed together and that seriously freaked me out i bolted up and turned on my light the weird thing is that i wasnt even really dreaming anything i just had this seriously uncomftorable scary feeling all the time fast forward about a month i stayed up reading opm chapters untill am on my phone when i had this amazing idea that i should probably go to sleep and i felt that same feeling my body felt so relaxed but this time i was dreaming i was dreaming of a figure climbing on my roof right infront of my window emergin from nowhere this dark figure and i thought i was awake but i couldnt move i tried to open my eyes with my fingers forcefully now at this point i was half asleep half awake and totally disoriented but when i finally woke up i just darted out of my room an hour had passed but felt like a minute seriously creeped me out i just wanted to share 
731,dream i had that i recreated in a quasi-short story form, jan dream so i m back at my old school in one of the container esque portables but the only people i remember there in the dream are classmates of nd school a girl i knew named shaila is using one of the computers doing work or gaming i can t recall i feel like she said something to me but i can t recall what she said now it is lunchtime and i m worried as i didn t bring any lunch with me this worrying of hunger seemed to be a theme here as in the dream i remember worrying that i might not get to eat but remember my luck when it comes to acquiring food my lucky stars align and magically appears an esoteric pizza vendor there selling only strange pizzas such as mayonnaise pizza contained in one of those let s go to the beach but first we need to make a futile journey to get ice coolers i buy one and he shows me my receipt and informs me of its cost he warned me beforehand that the pizzas are expensive but i m hungry so screw it twas but the receipt informed me it was only i shrug and give him his money i don t recall eating it though some other stuff happens at school but my brain has abstracted it so much that i can t recall or explain it easily fadeoutfast forward and i m now in an empty subway restaurant food chain but specifically the one that i work at i m playing ocean man by ween on a mandolin but i was playing it in g instead of its original key of e it has now come to my attention that i recall getting the mandolin at my school i remember messing with it and being blown away by a sort of tone switch that is on it the switch has options and the higher up i go with the switch the brighter and tangier the tone gets i don t even know how to play the mandolin but utilizes the knowledge i have of music theory and how the mandolin is tuned i bullshit my way through ocean man strange enough i played i v even though the verse of the song is i iv i also attempt to sing dean ween s tasty solo but i feel like i m off key and croaking it some strange hybrid of ocean man and take a walk on the wild side occurs my only audience a shy asian girl who applauds and compliments me after i am finished she does the cliche thing that people do after the performer is finished and tells me how much that song means to her but she does the classic i m nervous and don t feel exactly comfortable talking to strangers but what you just did was so cool that introverted me must say something i m still at the subway but it seems that the mandolin has disappeared and now i m in some slapstick bruce lee karate fight with some guy i kick his ass efficiently and with precision fadeouti ve become a camera filming a movie that involves a young brit spy who s on some mission and involved is some dame that looks like carol from the walking dead the spy does spy stuff and successively seduces the aforementioned dame before the let s make out or the naked part of sex she gives the young spy propositions and he agrees personal stuff like don t mess with my father or something of the sort extremely quick cut to the next and the spy and either the same girl or a different one are making love in the river of a marsh you can tell that there is tender and loving emotion in the act the way he wraps his arms around her back yells embrace she is receptive to his love making as she throats out sweet loving but quiet moans into his ear further evidence of their sweet and calm love making is obvious when you realize that there is little to no movement in the river where they have decided to commit coitus in post climax they let go of their romantic embrace and she falls into the water and floats for a bit the water under her starts to bubble up and she is given the time to cook then eat a lobster treatment and goes under at this point the spy is watching this scene unfold when he realizes that a certain point in this film he s in is that the water is messed up via radiation or the sort i don t know i didn t catch the exposition or background information of it must have been asleep and he cries out and goes to grab her but a friend of his already has taken hold of him as if to comfort him and says with his body language let her go 
732,any interpretation from this strange dream?,so last night i had a dream where out of context i saw two trees no branches with an almost red orange color i have no idea why but i was frightened and terrified on the dream and i woke up just as frightened as in the dream and i was left really confused about why i was recently reading a lot of alchemy and symbology but i still ca not understand why it disturbed me so much it was like i could feel the presence and energy of the trees and for some reason it felt really uncomfortable and disturbing 
733,weird tom and jerry/knockoff horror game dream,nsfw due to gore y imagery and general creepy stuff amp okay so the dream started with a tv screen with a grainy filter and in black and white with a cartoon playing with a lion character who wore a ringmaster type costume with i think an elephant and tom and jerry were there as well chasing alongside the knockoff toons in a painted background with grass and a weirdly colored sky until they reached a barn then the scene changed to jerry inside a garage with very weird lighting like it was super dark except for a large spotlight on him and beside him there was the corpse of tom with organs spilling out and flies there were also cameras filming jerry and the corpse and jerry had to eat a ghost pepper for a scene once he did he started to give a wide smile think the smile from invasion of the body slammers and his eyes started to become redder and bulged in the dream i think it meant that jerry could not handle the pepper and was about to die jerry then looked at me and started walking toward me and i kept backing up as he did so and as he was about to reach my leg probably to either harm me or something i woke up i think this dream was based on me watching some tom and jerry stuff and my brain mixing some creepypasta stuff in there amp fun fact in the dream it was implied that the jerry and tom that were being filmed were not the original tom or jerry but from long line of other similar looking mice and cats that would be replaced after every slapstick stunt anvils being shot etc that killed them 
734,dream of...people that didn't feel like part of the dream,i originally posted about this in lucid dreaming because it was weird i ca not exactly remember what the dream was exactly about but i had these guys approach me and ask me what clan i was part of i asked them what they meant and pointed to my ear cuffs which i wear irl but not to bed and said i was wearing triskele why would i wear those if i was not part of a clan they did not feel like they were part of my dream like they did not belong there at all they looked like vikings prob best way to describe them but like they were straight out of skyrim when i woke up i knew i had heard that word before or something similar i looked it up and sure enough it was the swirls my ear cuffs are a different version of them and were advertised as triskelion but i do not think of them being called that at all so it is weird that random people in my dream would even say that 
735,dream within a dream,i lived in this story apartment condo or something i knew the top floor were bedrooms and the bottom was an open area of the kitchen living room laundry it was not a house because i just knew it was not i lived there with my kids i had fallen asleep in a chair somewhere on the second floor and when i went to get up and go to my room floated to get there and face planted on the floor i got up and finished floating to my bed i was groggy so it did not really register that i was floating at first i got up and floated around the corner again however this time my cat was backing up and hissing then it dawned on me i was starting to become possessed i landed myself and faced the apparition trying to take my body and told it was not allowed to have me then strange faces started to appear in cracks in the doors i then realized this was a dream i told them i knew and they had no power here off to the side was a blue painting of pete davidson in his dream i said to myself if i am going to be lucid i want to dream hop i touched the painting and was pulled into his world he was dreaming about the press or something i wanted nothing to do with it and decided to explore the other parts of the dream i was able to fly around and noticed that there was a fire that someone left to get out of control i used magic to put it out and turned around to notice a clover fairy i find leaf clovers all the time irl so i decided to ask it how it felt about me picking them all the time she responded its ok we leave them there to give you lots of luck that is what they are for pick as many as you want then i started to wake up 
736,really weird,in my dream i was surrounded by darkness i didn t know where i was and couldn t find my way out suddenly this man was there holding my hand reassuring me leading me into the light it was a boy i hadn t seen or thought about since high school he had been one of the cool kids i was an outcast but he was always kind to me when i woke up i googled him he led a happy successful life but died five years ago the most interesting part is that he lived in a town that i have plans to visit this year as part of a mini vacation will he be my tour guide any thoughts

743,"dreamt about someone with dirt in their mouth, and i spit in it.. is this evil?",the intention behind it was i was trying to jump off a bridge because it was a suicidal dream unfortunately and one of my old questionable childhood friends he was older than me tried stopping me and some women from my dream who relatively caused it came running up and he socked her so i automatically pushed him away and punched him in return and somehow someway he was kinda running away but he had dirt in his mouth and something kinda made me spit in his mouth i ve heard that s evil i m also transcended spirituality but still telepathically invaded by some weird asshole making my spiritual realm and exposure in the dream state open to real things and real people being connected and dream sharing with me what could this al mean

749,i have dreams (usually nightmares) that i’m running away from things multiple times a week,does anyone else often have running away fleeing dreams last night i dreamt that i was forced into a cult planning a massacre i didn t want to kill or be killed so i fled the cult and was just running and running the whole time i ran i knew they were chasing me even tho i didn t turn to look i have lots of different scenarios but it s always me physically running from something and sometimes i stop and hide times out of the area in which i m running is my childhood neighborhood strangely enough i guess those streets are burned into my subconscious
750,my dream about a magical fantasy forest forged from a failed lab experiment,last night i had the craziest dream so i had to tell reddit about it it starts with me visiting family in the west we were at byu my family is mormon and there was a room at byu with these large ant nests i forgot how but the nests broke open and the ants started spreading wildly and creating more nests eventually my family started to build a bridge to the outside for the ants for some reason and the ants build a beautiful magical kingdom the forest is miniature and you must shrink to enter the kingdom now this is where the dream starts but my memory becomes fuzzy there was a girl who lived in the forest i think she was a family friend i ve never met but she decided to live in the forest in a little hut i kinda fell in love with this girl i d visit her all the time eventually she made it clear she can t date me some other things happen but unfortunately i forgot second dream in the same night was a sequel years after the first dream my family returns and we are exploring the forest climbing trees etc but i was there with one mission find that girl i was looking into this map but couldn t find her so i visited some other people and did some side quest until suddenly world war one started to break out in the forest i was scottish and on a huge british boat fighting the germans on land the germans sink the ship and i sink into the cold atlantic i don t know the fate of the magical forest but i really wish i could or find the girl sorry that i couldn t remember major details about the girl because that part of the dream was actually major and really deep but that s pretty much it hope y all enjoyed 
751,is it normal to have vivid dreams every day?,i dream every single day sometimes the dreams are more vivid sometimes less but the fact i dream every day is apparently not common my friends don t dream every day i don t mind dreaming every day but i m just wondering what s the cause of it 
752,dream/sleep fact # 28 of 365,i am going to post a dream sleep fact everyday for daysfact some animals such as dolphins and whales sleep with only one half of their brain at a time this allows them to stay partially alert and swim to the surface to breathe while they sleep 
753,reoccurring dream,mi have been having different dreams for the last years but they always end the same way i am a hockey player and have played since i was y o i have always been the violent type in hockey and always go for big hits and fights but i am only violent on the ice these dreams all start out differently but always end with a big fight but as i am throwing punches i have no power and am basically just kinda pushing the other guys face away what could this mean 
754,two nights ago i had a dream about going to jail for repeated unlicensed driving,the dream seamed very realistic at the time for some reason i remember it as if it actually happened does this have any meaning or am i just tripping balls in my dreams 
755,"i keep having a recurring dream that i've killed someone (a man who i knew briefly 10 years ago) hid the body, and now i'm effectively on the run each time i dream about it.",not sure if it is very related but context i am female live in europe avid traveller never killed anyone the man who i have killed in the dream is someone i knew for about days while on a trip years ago in singapore he sort of became an impromptu guide to the place for myself and my friend who was travelling with me at the time the dreams are always similar i do not dream of the actual act of murdering this nice chap but i know i have definitely killed him back in i know i buried his body near the peranakan museum i know i am on the run effectively from the singapore police but as far as i know nobody is on to me yet but my guilt within the dream and the feeling of dread is so real that i always wake up shake my husband awake and ask him if this ever happened i even occasionally text the friend who went with me to singapore to doubly make sure it never happened then a few hours pass in the day and i am pretty sure that i have properly returned to my reality and i forget the dream until days maybe a month later and i have the dream again this started happening in and has not stopped about years ago i got to the point where i thought i was going mad and my psychologist started to work on unpacking the dream with me but then some worse life stuff happened sibling died unexpectedly so my therapy became more grief counselling and the dream interpretation fell by the wayside i am now definitely nowhere near as emotionally affected by it but it still recurs and always makes me think it is happened so many times now that i have considered writing a story about it anybody else get these sorts of dreams how do you go about interpreting them and have they driven you slowly mad or are you still a reasonably adjusted individual 
756,dream that genuinely scared me,important thing to note in this dream i was very unsettled i had the feeling of i need to get out and a very odd cold feeling the whole time i woke up after just thinking stop wake up over and over after point which had come after ever have those really really fucked up dreams like incredibly fucked to the point where you are like how did my brain come up with that i have been trying to process all the things from it but so far all i know is that it started with a grocery store only being stocked with candy in a singular room but not the kind i liked there was a fucking homicidal lion like just chilling we were cuddling but then he tried to kill me reference to my ex maybe we got a dog named chrissy who was somehow possessed by someone named chrissy not sure who chrissy was in this dream but the moment we mentioned chrissy this wave washed over them and they acted like chrissy and i knew this without remembering who chrissy was blood seeped through our white couch which my brother said it had seem natural with natural tragedies for this to happen somehow i heard someone in the shower limping around in blood like i knew it was blood and apparently it had been like that for months also we were the kids from a series of unfortunate events i think it was partially due to the mousetrap a play i watched some time ago but all the other stuff mousetrap is a murder mystery but not gorey or violent just the only somewhat death related thing i have seen within the last month 
757,house dream,i keep having dreams about this house that i went to when i was very young my aunt lives there with my cousin and i have not been there in years i have not talked to either of them in over years last night i had a dream that i was renovating this house because for some reason i was the last person in the family capable of doing this in the dream portions of the floor had been haphazardly replaced with duct tape i jumped on the floor and sank an uncomfortable amount into the floor because of this i was insisting that the repairs be made correctly and tore out the duct tape floor where it needed wood replacement there were two square sections like dining room sized that needed replaced because of the improper repairs the second floor was sealed off with caulk because of a malevolence that noone wanted to face yet behind the windows i could see two black cats that lived there i wondered who fed them and thats when i woke up after sticking my head through the window to look this is the fourth dream about this house that i have had in the last two years the other dreams revolved around something being in the walls and something being underneath the house in each dream the second floor where my grandmother used to live was sealed off because there was some malevolent spirit there i brushed the previous dreams off as possibly my own hang ups or fears manifesting themselves now i do not know what to think is it possible that this house is calling out to me for some reason i was wondering if someone else had a similar experience or had any ideas about this the house itself is over years old and is severely dilapidated i looked it up on google maps 
758,had a dream where i got very lost,i was at a station port and i climbed onto the side of a cruise ship because it was funny it set off and i realised it was going way faster then i thought so i let go apparently it was going mph so when i let go i went from that speed to i swam to shore and realised i had a concussion i decided i needed to go home but i could reorient myself i asked this girl for help and we started walking through shops i finally asked we are in hometown right turned out i was at the other side of the country and i had no way of getting home i tried to ring my mum but my phone wouldn t work obviously i woke up disoriented and panicking never been happier to see i m at home in my life 
759,"dream of crush hurting his ankles, any hints on what on earth it means? 😆", requesting interpretations crazily enough i think i might have had a dream where my crush liked me back though i remember when he was walking with his friends they were being bullies with him and as i turned around at one point when we were all walking together they just stood around him when he tripped and hurt his ankles i couldn t believe no one tried to help him so i went and he let me help him we were on our way to a bus stop that allowed him and some children go home but because he could barely walk we missed the bus so instead we took a slide he was relieved that i was there to help him get on the slide because of him being hurt i was right behind him as if he was in my lap and when we were all ready to take the slide it was apparently the long and slow route to where the bus could ve taken us his home 
760,i had something similar to a possession,setting i use to do a work experience at my old school as a maintenance assistant the layout of the school was main set of stairs a folded wall that has the assembly hall and lunch hall inter linked a general overview not the complete layout but just so you can understand the where you are i had just finished doing a task in one the rooms that has cctv and i looked if anything or anyone doing something dumb when i see a mass of dark black mist on one of the closed off stairs that right near the science wing and decided to go and have a look as i open the door the large mass somehow ran towards me at a demon like speed next thing i know it i end up lying on the ground and as i get up there is no one around the bell has not went and the building looks bigger than usual i try to find the exit i have no look when i can usually find the main exit with my eyes close so why ca not i find it now i keeps searching no one around but every now and then i feel like i am being watched as time goes on i see a figure on my back looking into window like we both know what we were looking at i jump but it is still there it is face us contorted with a huge big fuck off grin on it and a oddly shaped skull and large lidless eyes and sharp claws i then went to a class room barricaded the door and slept and kept reliving the moment the dark mass came towards me i woke up i do not know how many hours and seen a image of something a dark skull protruding from it somewhere of unknowable thing on that dreaded sheet of paper i kept searching and searching and would have random black outs now and then and end up completely somewhere else till eventually i had found a light and a golden hollow orange hu of iridescent threads of a evening before it falls into night and made a run for it seeing of the strange dark masses what might as well being flying towards me and managed to reach the light before waking up 
761,weirdest dream of my life,the first thing i can remember is i was driving an atv around with my girlfriends sister who i supposedly got pregnant and we were visiting some random people in my town instead of stairs they had like a foot wooden ladder to the second floor not the four legged ones the ones you just push up against somethingi had bunny boots on and kept going back and forth up this ladder bringing a little kid up and then a bucket of something and every time i went up or down the ladder would wobble like crazy and feel like i would fall and i was wondering why am i almost falling every time then the father of the house went on the side of the ladder and pulled out a sign that said no bunny boots because somehow the sign got hidden behind hanging jackets then i said ahh that must be it and took them offwe then sat down at a table to talk me my gf s sister my bro irl and his baby mama and the dad and for some reason the dad just kept saying all these mean things to the baby mama then she started crying and i looked at everyone and they just dismissed it as normal so we movethen the cops come in and give me like a paper or something almost like a warrant it said because earlier in the day i beat up a little kid which is weird because in my dream mind i was thinking no i beat up my gf s brother who was not a kid anyway they read out the paper to me and said because i beat up the kid every morning i have to make the kid a bowl of cereal and call him cereal man as they were reading this the kid came into the room with a suit cape and mask on and said you shall call me cereal man i couldn t believe what was happening so i got up angry and said am i in a dream and turned to the right and saw a book on a bookshelf and that s what made my dream self believe it isn t a dream so then i go outside to the patio and jumped into the water because i couldn t believe the bs that was happening i can t swim in real life and apparently also in my dreams and realized this too late so i m just slowly going down flapping my arms and legs but nothings happening i look up and can see cereal man standing on the patio with his hands on his hips in a classic superhero pose i think to myself cmon man save me don t you want me to make you cereal every morning and call you cereal man but he just stands there so i just close my eyes and thankfully that s when i woke up closest i ever been to lucid dreaming but hands down the weirdest dream i ever had 
762,"whenever i have a dream that should be a nightmare, i end up biting the face off of the scary thing/monster",the last few nightmares i can remember as soon as i have become frightened i specifically lunged at whatever i was afraid of with my mouth open as to bite it is face off none of these dreams were lucid last night i had a dream and this small scrawny mid s dark hair lady came into my bathroom while i was showering turned to me and outstretched her hand like a zombie i did the same and as soon as we touched fingers she jolted and all life left her body and her eyes went white her jaw hung open unnaturally wide her face became sunken her hair was matted and tangly and thin and all this was accompanied by a ghastly reversed all encompassing scream my only reaction to this was immediately lunging mouth open at the ghastly figure with intent to rip her face off with my teeth i woke up making the same growling gargling noise i made as i attacked her can someone tell me what this means lmao

766,son having nightmares,hi guys my son has had nightmares within the last two weeks wakes up not remembering it but is super scared shaking and breathing extremely heavily heart beating super fast he also sometimes is saying i m sorry i m sorry for no reason also says this is why i need it we have no clue what he is talking about he ll walk around the house putting on all of the lights around the house and he tends to go to his middle brother instead of anyone else perhaps feels he is safer with that brother just tonight he also kept quickly brushing his fingers on his head as if there was something on his head that he was trying to get off at one point he even almost punched me in the face but immediately said i m so sorry clearly not meaning to throw the punch the closest thing i can compare these things brushing the fingers on his head and the thrown punch to would be tics but i m not educated enough to know if it is anything like that at times when he tries to explain the dream it is as if he can t form proper sentences like he wants to say what it was but he can t bring himself to please if anyone knows anything about these issues let me know thank you 
767,dream interpreter - any recommendations?,last night i had very different very vivid dreams i remember most details of the first and some important key ones from the second does anyone have a recommendation of someone i can talk to one on one for an interpretation of what the could mean i have read somethings but the details of these are leaving me confused thank you all 
768,i'm just want to know what my dreams mean. long post. dream help.,edit will no one give any advice i do not mind if it is only on one of the dreams or should i split them into multiple posts i am still confused and worried till this day ok so i am just gonna start off by saying that i did not want to post or write down any of my dreams because i believe strongly in manifestation and i do not want them to some how be attracted by me speaking or writing them into existence i ll never say these out loud or tell anyone close to me ever but lately i noticed a change in my dreams and i just want an idea of what they could mean this will probably be long and if i am not formatting correctly or something since i am new to reddit then please tell me of course any help insight into what my dreams mean would be awesome since i am legit freaked out i have insomnia so the times when i sleep and dream deeply are far in between of each other but the last couple of dreams starting back in december i have had have woken me in cold sweats and i just want closure like maybe it ll help me figure out from an outsiders perspective what the root issue is this is not the first time i have had dreams like this but i am just over not being able to share them and find out if they have any meaning so the first dream i have had that set this whole thing off was of me with my dog it was fairly calming i was making tea watching tv getting comfortable on my couch with my dog when suddenly there was a knock at my door i remember telling him to to calm down that it was alright and getting up to go towards the door when i fell and landed in a chair in front of a desk i was now in class i was confused because i was aware i knew what just happened and i made the conscious decision to look over and there was a table of people just watching the class a spotlight was on their table and i remember a woman sitting there behind a computer with red hair and glasses just looking at me she had stopped typing and was now staring in the background the teacher was speaking going over a math problem and i had turned back to him to watch what he was doing as well as glance over the class to see that no one else was paying attention everybody had their head down except this one girl who was blowing this huge bubble of gum she was sitting right next to me and no one seemed to notice the people watching i was legit starting to get anxiety so i looked down and decided to take notes the girl next to me popped her gum and what she said scared me shitless you see them do not you i dropped my pencil and just blanked she got up grabbed my collar dragged me over to them and said do you not see them this is not real this whole thing is fake that does not bother you she is practically getting hysterical and the woman with glasses simply states in the most dead panned tone so that woke me up and i threw myself up out of bed from the violent shaking i sat there because it was so vivid all of my dreams are but i remember her voice just shouting at me to not accept that false reality none of the people in my dream were people i knew they were all strangers no likeness to anyone end of dream the next couple are long if you have opinions on just one of my dreams you can ignore the others i was not going to include these since they end with me dying as usual but the way they happen has differed from my usual dreams and these are recent so here they are i live in a story house if you were to walk through the front door there would be a living room to your right a closet on your left and stairs to my room straight ahead my room has no windows except to the right of my bed if you go through the living room you end up in the kitchen with my parents room on the left across from the sliding doors and the garage on the right this is important because it takes place at my house and the dream changed the interior slightly in the dream there is windows all along my wall to the left of my bed going up to the ceiling with the ceiling also being all windows also when i go through the living room i come into the kitchen but the only way to get to my parents room is suddenly outside the sliding glass doors and connected to another glass door on the deck to their room the dream starts with me waking up in my bed i am just laying there and i turn to my left to look at my phone and see the time it is am i am tired so i put it back down and just stare at my ceiling except i take notice that there are windows confused i follow the windows to my left and notice the windows that make up my wall i pinpoint a small flashing light in the distance it is blue and red with bright white lights the lights are getting closer and with it a rumbling roar the closer it gets the more the house is shaking and so is my heart practically ready to burst out of my chest the adrenaline is pumping and i scramble to get out of the bed to stand and just figure out what the heck is getting closer the roar is deafening at this point and i am screaming thinking about how i am witnessing a plane heading right for my house my room the biggest fucking plane and i am about to just accept that it is going to hit me it is approaching approaching more even closer and just barely flies over the roof and towards the north or the right of my bed the thing i remember most is being so thankful that it missed me and i am just taking in every detail of this plane flying over my head i could see the lights from earlier landing gear out the huge wings it feels like forever as its passing overhead i am ready to scream again and i just take off i am running down the stairs to the kitchen and take notice that the only way to my mom is room is outside so i open the sliding door and just turn to my left and start banging on the glass door since it was locked all this to wake her up and tell her about the plane i wanted to know if she felt it too i was hyperventilating and it started to thunder i can see her sleeping and she wo not wake up i keep banging yelling mom to open the door she finally opens her eyes she is groggy sluggish even and just yells what i point at the door and mouth open when she chimes back that it is already open i am visibly confused but slide the door open anyway when she snaps to attention just struck by the horror of whatever she is seeing she is sat rigidly upright just pointing when lighting strikes and a growl breaks out behind me i flinch can feel the heat behind me the drool dripping down behind me once again i am shaking and i do not even turn around the glass door closes and i can see the bear is reflection in the glass door behind me my mom starts screaming jumping up and down and i kind of just accept it the bear dips down and i wake up feeling like i just had my head neck and back crushed between powerful jaws i was dripping in a cold sweat from this one this one unsettled me so much so that i got up and had to walk down to my moms room just to make sure it was normal i was so unsettled from the feeling of being there and dying that i needed a cold shower i got super paranoid of letting my dog out i now look to make sure there are no bears around before i open that door end of dream this next one was really short i just remembered being so horrified by the feeling that i woke up it is a dream where i am sitting on my couch eating a sandwich when something gets stuck in my gums i put my food down and hesitantly touch my bottom row of teeth and try to suck it out i am struggling but it is within reach enough that i feel like i can get it out easy so i continue trying when i feel a wiggle the wiggle intensifies because i am in disbelief i am like there is no way that is loose so i keep playing with it like i am trying to deny that it is happening the wiggle turns into my tooth coming lose and i just roll it around in my mouth before popping it out and onto my lap i am sitting there speechless my anxiety is rising again and i just hold this tooth my tooth when i feel all my teeth suddenly become sore i shut my mouth tight but my tongue lightly taps each one to make sure they are still there they all loosen my heart drops and i feel a lump in my throat i slap both of my hands over my mouth to try and keep them in i can feel my saliva pooling and my teeth falling out by to swish around in the drool my jaw is tightening the teeth feel like rocks and my spit keeps leaking out the corner or my lips i wake up once i choke on them when i wake up though i am watching myself on the couch choke on these teeth i watch my hands drop and the rest of my teeth come flowing out i wake up again end of dream this next one starts out in america on the west side in california i do not live there so this dream was the weirdest one especially because of how it develops this one probably confuses me the most i become aware that i am in a parking lot it is vast feels like it could belong to a super mall there is cars but they are all far away except this jeep for some reason i have a job in a place i do not know and i recognize that i am on break hanging out in this parking lot the wind picks up the clouds come in and the objects from the sky fly in they are attacking everything they look like flashes of light streaking across and someone shouts aliens everyone tries to take cover and i run towards the jeep i saw earlier i get in the back seat duck down and try to hide and hope everything just blows over when a silver intricate ball flies through the window into the back seat with me for some reason it asks for help to hide too it twists and turns talks kind of like a robot and asks to please not be given back that they were coming for it i tuck it close and stay down the aliens come and try to break in through the door of the jeep on the ceiling and the windows the car is shaking and i open the back door to jump out but realize it is raining i looked down at the sphere and remember deciding to not jump out because then it would get wet and for some reason i knew it could not be wet so i just stay in the jeep until other aliens came and shoot at the ones on the jeep they were fighting over it it had stopped raining so i made a run for it i was running through this parking lot when i saw a group of people running towards this forest and hiding from the aliens the people were nice and let me tag along we had been hiking up a hill through the trees when we stumbled on to some tracks they were train tracks it was a mass group the longest of lines where people were making this journey to somewhere no one knew where just that it was safe and we were all together it was steep on the side of a mountain the walk was so long i recall days passing i had slept outside made a fire with the group that took me in and the ball i decided to take along was quiet asleep the whole time it had been almost a week when we stumbled upon a house it was my house in a place that it did not belong and my family was there the whole thing felt like a dream at that point i was so tired but the group i was with wanted to stop and we all decided to spend the night at my house to stock up we were about leave when my mom handed me some books and told me to go pick what i wanted to take along since this would be the last time we could come back i had a back pack i could only fit so much and carry so much for some reason though i was stuck i could not decide what to take i was struggling between the books i was given and my computer this decision was so conflicting that my mom and the group started to plead with me to leave they were yelling at me to just pick they were screaming that the train had arrived and we needed to go i could see people getting on this train and time was running out but i could not pick everyone was running towards this train and i had decided to shove the books into my backpack just as i got up and started towards the train the horn sounded off and people were fighting to get on this train out of no where the aliens return and start shooting at everybody with it the rain rolls in and a huge crashing roar rages as it rushes towards us it is this huge tsunami i am watching as it sweeps everyone up behind me i am running thinking about how i never pictured myself drowning how a devasting event like this was not supposed to happen in my lifetime how i would think to myself and be thankful that the movies of people being swept up did not involve me i remember realizing i was not going to make it all because i could not choose i finally felt the water crash into me quickly rising until i got swallowed up all warmth left me and i took my last breath i woke up gasping for air i clutched my throat and took huge breaths to calm down the feeling of suffocation was so strong i needed fresh air and went downstairs to let my dog out end of dream lastly this also takes place in america specifically ohio again i do not live there i just knew that is where i was and also half of mexico and texas i do not remember much just that i was driving on the highway surrounded by corn wheat fields anyway i am driving with my family in the car when i see this bright streak of light stretching across the horizon of the night sky it was so brightly lit that i thought it was day time it becomes dark again but now there are tons of tiny little dots falling towards us i remember one fell right in front of me barely missing halting my driving and realizing it was a rock i turned to my family and they yell at me to drive do not stop i put the car in reverse the tires squealing when a deafening boom resounds i am thrusted out of my body into the air and look around to figure out what happened i see the car the rock and notice a naval ship in the distance another boom resounds and i see a crater form where the top of mexico is and all of texas another boom goes off from the ship i noticed behind me following the line of the boom california is gone and with it a crater forms glancing back towards the car the land morphs and it becomes board game i see lines appearing the ground turns to paper and i am thrown back into my body to continue driving i head off road and just try to steer clear and figure out where the rocks will land a letter amp a number are called and i realized this felt like battle ships but the ships were targeting the land i am hyperventilating at this point scared that i am gonna get squished when the ground begins caving in around me the ground starts trembling beneath me and i fall in i look up only to watch the sky get further away and soon be covered by a falling rock i wake up again in a cold sweat with a pounding headache end of dream that is all for now if anyone can help just bring some clarity that would be great 
769,she keeps showing up,here i am again for the second time in exactly two weeks i had a dream about danielle i very seldom dream of people like this i mean i still occasionally see my gorgeous latina goddess who traipses through my dreams on no discernable schedule named eliana delmyna rubio who is real and will one day be my perfect lover in the waking world but that is beside the point i have had two dreams within one month about a woman i have not seen in seven years and counting she was dressed very nice in this dream out of character for her in real life she had her hair in a sort of folded over ponytail on one shoulder and wore a brown jacket over a white shirt with a navy blue knee length loose flowing skirt wow she looked stunning and she was even more overtly flirtatious with me in this dream which is unusual as she is married with children but who knows she could be divorced by now i mean it is been seven years since i last saw her she could not stay away from me very long and just smiled and laughed as long as her eyes lay upon me it was a very positive dream and i am happy to have had it but why do i keep dreaming of her we were getting fairly close by the time i graduated and i can only come to the conclusion that she misses me a lot more than i will ever know i hope that i meet her again one day in the waking world i venture out for necessities tomorrow perhaps the dreams are preludes to an emotional reuniting i sure hope so she has returned to my mind and my heart i miss her and replaying her voice in my mind brings tears of conflicted feeling to my eyes i cannot even hold it together writing this only she and eliana delmyna have ever been able to give me dreams that make me so emotional in the waking world is there something bigger in store for us that i have not taken into consideration i am beginning to wonder she and i had a good relationship and i would even visit with her on her off time there was two weeks though back in the end of to beginning of where i could not bring myself to be near her around that time i had a dream where i died due to stomach cancer and she was with me when i died during those two weeks even the thought of her made me cry my mom was also using a perfume from bath and body works that danielle used too i recently found a higher end wax melts at walmart that smells just like it so maybe the smell is playing a part in triggering the memories that are being rehashed through my dreams i miss her so much and i now really want to see her again but i do not know if she even lives in the town i live in anymore i am keeping my fingers crossed that she does for i would be delighted to reunite with her just wanted to share this update on my previous post about my dreams of beautiful danielle 
770,coma music......,i had a nasty grand mal seizure a few years back and conked my head face on a curb coma lasted ish days and the entire time i remember one song playing in what i thought was real time i heard the people around scream for help the ambulance sirens the paramedics talking to me even the hospital staff talking but not knowing what they were saying because the song was so loud with a mind shaking drum beat and guitar riffs that howled and were amazing to hear when the song finished my eyes opened and i had no clue why i was in a hospital or why i had ivs in my arms a tube down my throat and another up my dick and why the hell did it smell like shit in here it was me after a few more days of tests and surprisingly great food celebration hospital in florida nearest to disney world i was discharged with a boatload of aftercare instructions and a myriad of meds when i finally made it home that song bothered me because i could not remember who it was by i listened to everything i already loved then stuff i was indifferent about and even genres that i really dislike nothing not one handful of notes that even came close it bothered me so much i started to hate the muted echo i still had of it in the back of my mind at all hours i thought i was going to start pulling out my hair and chewing on rocks just to distract myself finally after about months or so it started to dull and fade out coincidentally i was able to start playing some of my instruments more and more again and i felt more like myself than i had in quite some time fast forward a few weeks after the noise was gone i am just chilling out on the couch with my acoustic playing a few old original songs and i start zoning out next thing i know i am playing the lead to that fn song a lead riff that i have never played before but i knew it was the one that haunted me i grabbed my les paul and hit record on my equipment and just kept going until i felt like i got the lead then i immediately knew the rhythm guitar chords and made it through that as well for me i always write rhythm first then find and write the lead this was assbackwards i called a buddy of mine that is an amazing drummer and ask if i can send him tracks to see what he could do half week later he sends the individual tracks and also a mixed track with all instruments going in time it was the songs beat fml how i told him nothing about where i heard it or how i came up with the lead and rhythm guitar lines nothing just asked him to listen and put down a beat it freaked me out so much i asked him to delete my tracks that i sent and the mix down he made but to keep his beats i deleted that mix so fn fast now years later i have no idea what it was and i am incredibly grateful for that way to close to the sun for me the song is gone but that weird awkward feeling creeps up a few times a year whenever i think i am getting too close to it again in the real world or dreamland never told anyone about this before but i thought it might be interesting to someone 
771,dream that mom died,i am severely worried so much so that it is am and i can t go back to sleep because i read a little into precognition last night i had a big argument with my mom about how my dad was narcissistic and didn t want me to drive because it meant i wasn t going to rely on him anymore and become independent i also have very bad anxiety so any emotional thing spurs some intense dreams about my worries basically it was in a car and i was sitting in the drivers seat i have just started driving irl and have bad anxiety over it so naturally i was worried in my dream i hit the gas too much and end up hitting the pole in the middle of an intersection but the thing was it was a weird dream so it was like my dad was also in the drivers seat controlling my driving my mom was in the passenger 
772,attempted break in dream,i was in my house sitting in the living room i got up to go to bed when i noticed i had left the porch light on in the front i flipped the switch inside and it shut off almost immediately afterward someone started banging on my door turning the door handle i looked through the peephole and saw an adult man and a boy child maybe or as the perpetrators after there fists became exhausted the man started using a crow bar to bash there door in but on my side there was no damage and they could not make headway after a few minutes of this they both ran toward a windowless white van parked across the street where the man handed the child the crowbar the child ran back to my door to begin striking again but then the man drove off leaving the child behind the child stopped assaulting my home and stood there in disbelief that he had been abandoned the dream ended here from what research i have done it has been suggested that break ins tend to represent an agressive trait or personality that is trying to break through i can understand the adult representing the agressive behavior but the presence of the child perplexed me the only representation i can think of is that the child represents my baseline personality often accompanied with angry or agressive flare ups that i potentially use my aggression to get myself into situations where my baseline has no impact and when i need that passion it abandons me that is my pretentious take what do yall think 
773,running like a dog in the church’s garden,so i dreamed that one of my classmates needed to go to the north to visit his family and for some reason i was going with him i get late to the plane when i arrive at the city everything is so pretty then i see this church with an colorful vivid garden and i get so happy that i start running like a dog towards it then a nun stops me and scolds me

788,doppelganger family,i dreamed about a family being stalked by their own doppelgangers the doppelganger is sole purpose was to replace each and every original family member a mother father daughter and son for reasons that were unclear in the dream but the doppelgangers were vehement in their mission to do so while at a grocery store the family were in the check out line the daughter and son were roughhousing the mother was making a transaction with the cashier while the father loaded bags of groceries onto a shopping cart very much a nuclear family type the father lifted a seemingly heavy bag and leaned in to tell the mother something but when she looked at him he froze dropping everything to the ground without taking notice and began to shake violently while breaking into a nervous sweat you he said get away from me the mother looked concerned but the father stood his ground somebody get her away from me i am gonna be sick he leaned forward hands on his knees breathing heavily the children had taken notice and huddled up behind the mother in fear as she pleaded for him to calm down to which he responded hysterically you are not my wife somebody get her away from me please i am gonna be sick the look on the mother is face went from concerned to annoyed and disgusted pure evil he was right it was not his wife this is all i remember before waking up

791,i felt death in a very vivid dream,let me preface this by saying that i am not a religious person in the slightest i also know that dreams of dying are very common and i have had them before but somehow this dream stands out it felt far more vivid than any dream i think i have ever had as is with most dreams i only remember a certain part of it a demon so to say was threatening my friend and i defended my friend this demon said if i did not back down i would be killed i of course did not back down i started to feel very weak and slowly fell to the ground my muscles started to give out and i became very at peace with reality i was not scared i was simply curious i vividly remember asking myself if there was a god and if i would go to heaven or hell again i am not religious i was really just curious about what happened after death i realized that this was the end and that i could do nothing to stop it but despite all this the dream felt way wayy too vivid i have had dreams of death before and i usually realize it is a dream the second i actually die but in this dream i thought i was really dying i laid on the floor dying for quite a few minutes all of it felt so real but it was peaceful and powerful i do not know why but i felt as if i had all the willpower of the universe as i literally laid dead it was so surreal i know that dreams of death symbolize change but this one feels like it is so much more i want to truly know what this meant

797,what’s your interpretation of the dream?,the dream begins with a group of us hanging out in the woods there s a tribal woman in the group that recognizes a doll looked more like a sachet than a doll that a young girl had lying out on a rock she says she wants to put it where it s meant to be somewhere dark like a forest even though we were already in the woods doesn t seem we go anywhere but she then lays it on a different rock maybe ft away and says this is how it s meant to be she then wants to take me to see a treasure somewhere face away we then began leaping jumping across large masses of land and waters the destination was a pond of crystal clear water we swam around briefly and i decided to venture underneath once i was a few feet under i noticed there were sea turtles and lots of fish then i noticed an eel approaching i felt uncomfortable and panic slowly crept in it didn t seem to have intentions of harming me just swimming towards me as if acknowledging my presence before veering off to my right in my mind i pictured myself whooshing it away had it gotten any closer once i came back up to the surface i noticed a few of my friends sitting around the edges the pond became more pool like the guys were doing cannon balls and flips into the water i felt as though they weren t truly appreciating and seeing the beauty in the water so i decided to show them how beautiful it was i get into the water attempting to submerge myself while laying flat on the surface only to realize i was naked i somehow used the surface of the water to blanket parts of my naked body one of the guys made a comment life of a stripper even though i ve never done anything of the sort i wasn t ashamed or embarrassed for being exposed in front of my friends irl i would be the dream ends with me stuck on the surface of the water despite it moving beneath me
798,person telling me to meet her irl in a dream,so a while ago almost a year i had a weird dream that i kept thinking about recently it basically goes like this so it starts off just with a girl looking at me on the beach next scene we small talk during night next scene i m playing a weird version of football in a stadium that s not related to this story anyway the girl is on the field staring at the stars i go up to her and ask her if she knows she s in a dream and she surprisingly responds with just yes i tell her about how annoying this dream is because it spawned me in the middle of the game so i don t really understand what s going on she laughs and agrees with me telling me that these dreams are annoying for her as well as we are leaving the stadium she suddenly grabs my arm and tells me that her name is hannah and to meet her in real life at a certain address i get thrown on the floor by some people and get kicked in the stomach i wake up in a dream where i write down the address and then i wake up for real after that i quickly did what my last dream suggested but i also decided to write down the whole dream so i don t forget the address is in italy where i live and it does exist but while i never heard of it in my life it could sound generic enough for my mind to make up i was very hyped about it at the time and i also wanted to go there just to check but i got distracted and quickly forgot i never told anyone this story this was last year in august was my mind extremely creative or does this hannah exist 
799,can anyone else breathe under water in your dreams?,i have always been able to it is always in the most stressful dreams when something is chasing me and stuff like that and i always end up jumping in to clear water sinking to the bottom and just calmnly breathing in and out it is the best feeling i have ever felt it feels so calm like non of the crap going on above matters non of that can reach me it feels like home everytime a video of clear calm waters pops up i cry i don t know why it just hurts my heart in some way and i just want to go to sleep and hope that i get to breathe under water again

809,manta raya,my dreams are usually weird but last night was the first time i ve dreamed about manta rays somehow i don t even know how i was sitting in a park bench surrounded by moving water it gave the sense of sea but i am not sure it was the sea because the waves were not big they were slightly intimidating though the water was grey green brown and as each wave moved i could see huge manta rays moving through it some very close to the surface while others a bit deeper but i could see their shape i have never dreamed about this anima before and i was wondering if simone could point me to resources to find out more about their meaning 
810,i keep dreaming about getting murdered,its been like this for the past year off and on they are always death by a gunman the last one was nights ago and really shook me up i was sitting on a floor with some people at what i think was my college then a bell rang and people started walking past the room i was in a gunman shot someone near him three times in the chest then faced me just outside the door and shot me another one i was in an apartment complex hiding with two young kids a gunman came in shot the kids and then shot me three times in the chest aswell there is several more stories like these but these stuck out to me the most everytime i get shot i can always feel the pain its like a balloon popping in my chest then i wake up and feel like i ca not breathe i have never been a victim to any gun violence i am not under any extreme stress lifes actually been a lot better for me recently so why is this happening 
811,i'm confused &amp; scared.,last night i had a dream where flea like bugs amp maggot like worms were bouncing amp crawling onto me biting my legs amp feet the flea bugs would bounce onto me everywhere from the knee down amp the worms would range anywhere from tapeworm to mealworm size but would crawl just onto my feet amp between my toes i also remember trying to pull the worms off as they had attach to me like leaches but were not leaches amp they had just then bite my hands amp attach themselves onto my hands i vividly remember how it felt though typically you are not supposed to feel anything in your dreams but i definitely felt everything happening it was incredibly painful now to the big question for any psychologists reading this what did my dream possibly mean

814,weird dreams,i have been having weird dreams lately and been hearing a lot of things around my house when i am alone i do not know if it is auditory hallucinations or if it is something more but last night was one of the weirdest dreams at this point i do not know if it even was a dream or not it felt all too real to be one but i was in this weird building it was sort of like an amusement park but inside i do not know but the part that was odd was it was practically abandoned yet people who i have never seen before were doing construction making a new attraction for people who were not even there one said attraction was a colorful and fun little area with carts that took you around but a figure appeared saying you better get out he is hungry before i heard something large coming towards me then another part of that same dream there was a little boy who just had this look in his eyes he looked like he meant harm and before he did anything i woke up i do not know what it was about that dream but it felt like i was actually there i felt the pain of hitting my shoulder on a wall the fear i felt in my chest and just everything that you would not feel in a normal dream you ca not feel pain in dreams can you if somebody can explain what i experienced please tell me in the comments it really freaked me out and i ca not stop thinking about it
815,i need a dream reading,a couple of nights ago i had this disturbing and soul shattering dream for context i ve been having similar dreams for a couple of months now the most of the dream is quite fuzzy but i clearly remember certain actions and the way it made me feel the main characters were my best friend who passed away almost a year ago and this guy i had a situationship with that i have developed feelings for in the dream i was given the option to kill let the guy i care for die in order to bring my best friend back which i did with close to no hesitation the dream continued with me having a conversation with my best friend like nothing had happened i think it is also worth mentioning that irl the situationship developed due to the death of my friend any opinions 
816,baby sleeping on a bed,i dreamed that i woke up and my house was completely alone and i was looking for my family when i saw that my parents window was open a person could easily get in and in my brothers bed his own room there was a baby sleeping i want to know what this could mean lol for me it was something like someone got in and let the baby there to get rid of him but i obviously do not know anything about dreams meanings and shit so yeah help pls 
817,another night of existential dreaming,basically it was like an insight into alternative timelines where other me s would dive into different realms what we think of as dreams and go through like moral choices to gauge the average response except i was the rogue one because the chip implanted in me was broken so i could recognize i was dreaming and control the dream to a certain extent basically i could do almost anything my ultimate power was the thank you i would cup my hands together and hold them at the sky and say thank you for insert experience here and then cast it at the ground and it would destroy everything or irreparably change it if i specified a reward for my thanks it would manifest in the most chaotic way possible i was then jerked out of the dream after i did a dream destroying thank you and was questioned about it i d been doing them for a while but they only just caught me because there were billions of different me s all cycling though dreams at the same time the controller wasn t a me but someone i didn t know she said i was ruining the algorithm and that they were going to terminate me for going off course and that they were doing this to make the world a better place i scoffed and said it s too late for one person or even a million people to make a difference in the world it s already doomed through years and years of misuse of resources warmongering and purposefully constructed otherism the notion that we are better than them because they are different i told her that earth is doomed by the hubris of man and if she only just started realizing that then she was objectively a naive idiot i said what are you going to do next then wait until the earth turns barren and empty then move on to the next planet to perform your nonsensical simulations for the vague and unachievable goal of making a better place that s ludicrous if you actually wanted to create a better world just step up and use whatever powers you have over dreaming to influence people s realities instead of trying to gauge how much capacity they have for good then i woke up 
818,self referencing dream,just had a dream that i woke up late on a day that everyone had to see an incredibly important movie there were some random introductory details about electronic wall vines on my window and then looking out said window to see an adjacent building being evacuated due to a fire alarm which ended up coming true when i actually woke up interestingly enough except in my own building instead of an adjacent one which i ended up sleeping through and found out about later in the day due to the alarm only going off on the ground floor for some reason the interesting part happened when i finally got around to seeing the movie though i made my way through some hallways and stairwells pushed ahead of a rowdy crowd who was also rushing to see the movie and made it to a snowy outdoor area with a long line to the box office kiosk as i was waiting in line with the confidence that i had gotten there in time after all i spotted an led sign on top of the kiosk i don t remember the exact wording of the sign but it said something along the lines of of people wake up after seeing this movie of people wake up while seeing this movie i do remember what i thought when i saw this sign which was hmm this movie must appear in people s dreams sometimes maybe that s why it s such a revolutionary film i was not aware that i myself was dreaming i made it through the line to the box office and successfully received my ticket as i was walking away the guy in the booth reminded me that i hadn t paid yet so i paid with a debit card he made some comment about having credit on my account that i could have used but i didn t understand it and kept walking in towards the theater before i made it inside i woke up has this happened to anyone else where you ve received signs that you re dreaming whether you already knew that you were dreaming or not

824,dream working and spirituality,i was with an acquaintance and we both work with magick are spiritual we came to the topic of dreams and they actually basically work entirely in the dreamspace their dreams are as indescribable and non mundane as mine but they seem to remember almost everything from them and know what s going on in them whereas when i wake up i can t make much sense of them and their too complicated to remember fully my question is do most people who work with magick have a spiritual practice are your dreams like mine or theirs where they are very complicated it doesn t involve your mundane life world very much or you re not even yourself like you re basically sharing a consciousness with the main character of the dream
