       "986    as the title says it s a recurring dream but some very slight details change from time to time such as faces vehicles etc the dream is always the same with slight changes i m driving down a road way and come up to a crowd of what looks like journalists looks to be in front of an airport as i approach they all swarm the vehicle one almost always gets the back right door of my car open barraging me with countless unintelligible questions i start to panick and start to drive off right after trying to escape the situation a car always pulls in front of me the exact same way trying to box me in i pull to t intersection where there s a cop sitting on the shoulder of the roadway but they don t move i cross the intersection in the car making a left hand turn at which time a small group that thinks i hurt the journalist starts chasing on foot in their cars usually the dream ends with hearing gunfire half the time hitting the cars chasing mr others i m being shot at the dream usually ends there with me waking up with an accelerated heart rate sorry if this is a bit jumbled confused and riddle with typos i just literally woke up from that same dream and figured i d come here and write it down while it s somewhat fresh in my mind as i only dream once or twice a week max and it s always this dream \n",
